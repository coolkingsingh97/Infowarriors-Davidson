Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ellen West

And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Ellen. We have a strong 2018, with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners and enterprise customers.
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion or up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency, as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and Desktop Search.
For today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter: our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions: U.S. revenues were $18.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $12.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year in both reported and constant currency terms with a slight headwind primarily from the euro.
APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 32% in constant currency, reflecting weakness of the Australian dollar. Other Americas revenues were $2.2 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $17.9 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.

The key drivers were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues. Second, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation and, third, hardware related costs for our made by Google and Nest family of products.
Operating expenses were $13.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses, with the larger driver being headcount growth, followed by the accrual of compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. Growth in Sales and marketing expenses reflect increases in sales and marketing headcount primarily for Cloud and Ads followed by advertising investments mainly in Search and the Assistant. The growth in G&A expenses reflects mostly increases in headcount.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 98,771, up 4,399 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $8.2 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 21%. Other income and expense was $1.9 billion, which includes $1.3 billion of unrealized gain related to a non-marketable debt security investment. We provide more detail on these line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the U.S Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $12.77.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.1 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13 billion with free cash flow of $5.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $109 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $39.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and Google Ad Manager.
Other revenues for Google were $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year fueled by Cloud, Hardware and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.4 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 15% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, followed by changes in partner agreements offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter.
In Q4, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year, primarily due to our revenue mix shift within our programmatic business. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.7 billion, up 13% versus last year and the operating margin was 24.8%.Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.8 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities, datacenters, and servers.

Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. I'll cover results for the full-year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for Other Bets over a longer-term horizon, as we've discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.
For the full-year 2018, Other Bets revenues were $595 million, up 25% versus 2017 primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for Other Bets was $3.4 billion for the full-year 2018 versus an operating loss of $2.7 billion in 2017. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $181 million, down from $493 million in 2017 primarily reflecting investments in Fiber.
Key recent accomplishments include: in December, Waymo launched Waymo One, which enables participants to use its app to hail and pay for rides. Also Verily recently announced a $1 billion investment round led by Silver Lake as it advances on plans that are complementary and additive to its current life sciences portfolio. That investment of course was in addition to the $800 million it raised from Temasek previously.
Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. Our 23% revenue growth in 2018 was powered in particular by the ongoing benefit of innovation in our Sites business. With eight products, with more than 1 billion users each and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe.
In particular, we see significant ongoing potential to apply our machine learning capabilities across our businesses. In our advertising business, machine learning has enabled innovation in advertisers ability to match consumer intent into bit more effectively for improved ROI. It has also enhanced the ability of smaller businesses to benefit from advertising on our platforms.
Machine learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses, like Cloud and Hardware, as well as central to a number of Other Bets, most notably Waymo and Verily. Looking ahead, a couple of things to note. First, as we’ve said many times, we continuously work to enhance the user and advertiser experience because we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly, in search advertising can vary which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth.
Second, during 2018, the FX tailwinds in the first half of the year turn to headwinds in the third and fourth quarters, in line with the strengthening of the U.S dollar. Based on the continuing strengthening of the U.S dollar, we expect a headwind to reported versus fixed FX results in the first quarter, in contrast to the favorable impact of FX in the first quarter of 2018.
Turning to investments and profitability. In terms of gross margin, the biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. As we've discussed on prior calls, while the pace of year-on-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues, slowed after the first quarter of 2018. We do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search.
Within OpEx, we remain focused on prioritization in order to optimize resources for longer-term growth in sizable markets. You'll see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain concentrated in R&D. Although we expect the growth rate to moderate in 2019. In 2018, we also saw continued progress on our goal to nurture new businesses outside of Google, our Other Bets with a model of independence.

While I've said previously that there is no monolithic approach to how the Other Bets execute against opportunities, a shared principle is aligning employee interest with the long-term value creation by these companies. Since inception, this has been an important part of our approach at Google with stock grants comprising a meaningful component of overall compensation across our employee days.
We are increasingly following that approach in the Other Bets with compensation programs that align employee and company interests. You’ve seen the impact of some of those programs in the fourth quarter as we accrued compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. While these expenses will recur, the timing evaluation events is unpredictable and can vary between debts which can affect quarterly comparisons.
Finally, on capital allocation. Our primary use continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions. After taking these needs into account, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 12.5 billion of our Class C capital stock.
With respect to CapEx, we continue to invest in both compute requirements and for office facilities. Although we expect the CapEx growth rate in 2019 to moderate quite significantly. In conclusion, 2018 was another great year, with tremendous ongoing opportunity ahead of us.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Ruth. Last year, we set out to bring the benefits of AI to everyone through our products. And I'm proud of the tremendous progress we made towards that goal. From smart compose and Gmail to the new Google news experience, to call screening on the pixel and improving the overall safety of our products. AI's helping people get things done every day. Beyond our products, AI is also helping us drive our mission forward at the scale we couldn’t have imagined just a few years ago.
Google Al Lead, Jeff Dean recapped the results of our efforts in a great post on our AI block. Accusing AI to better deduct the spread of breast cancer, or providing flood victims, with real-time information in a crisis. I encourage everyone to check it out.
We also launched the Google AI impact challenge to help nonprofits find ways to use AI to solve social and environmental problems. In addition to our progress in AI we saw great traction across newer areas, like the Google assistant, hardware, and Cloud. And our core area such as search maps new use YouTube under computing and advertising platforms continue their strong momentum.
Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge. And one that is constantly getting harder. But we’ve 20 years of experience in these information challenges, and it's what we strive to do better than anyone else.
As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping uses data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems and giving people better and clearer controls. You will see us continue to do a lot more here in 2019.
Today I will start by sharing some of the new ways that we are working towards our mission. Then I will give an update on our video and advertising platforms, followed by the latest on our hardware and cloud efforts. And I will close with a few thoughts on our investments around the world. First, advancing our mission of making information accessible and useful. The Google assistant is a great example of how we help people throughout the day and we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features.

From the Lenovo Smart Clock that wakes you up in the morning to real-time navigation that helps during your commute. To a build in interpreter that translates conversations across dozens of languages on Google home. And speaking of languages, over the past year the Google assistant expanded from eight languages and 14 countries to nearly 30 languages and 80 countries. In that time, the number of active users us quadruple. As we had more partners, devices and capabilities, the Google assistant will only get better and more helpful.
There's a lot of great progress in other areas too. Last month, we announced the launch of activity cards and search. Now when you search for a topic that you’ve previously explode, you can quickly see very of already being and pick up where you left off. Thanks to our strengths in AI and Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than 1 billion products. So if you see an item that you like, Lens can show you similar designs, along with useful information like product reviews.
We continue to see great momentum across our computing platforms, android and chrome. In Q4, we announced that android was officially support affordable phones that partners like Samson introducing their first portable devices this year. We see continued traction with manufacturer adoption of android auto. We recently announced new media and messaging features to significantly simplify and improve the car dashboard experience.
And building on the speed simplicity and security of chrome OS, partners like Asus and HP, introduced a slew of great consumer and enterprise Chromebooks last months at CES. Now let me provide an update on our video and advertising platforms, starting with YouTube.
We are seeing great traction in some of our newer experiences on YouTube. YouTube music and YouTube Premium are now available in nearly 30 countries up from five countries at the start of 2018. Last month, YouTube TV announced that it is expanded nationwide to cover 98% of U.S households with the rest to follow shortly. YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly 2 billion monthly log in users.
For instance in Q4, the expanded access to tools like stories and community polls that strengthen the connections between France and creators. One of our newest tools, Premiers, is a breakout hit. Ariana Grande's premiere of her official music video for Thank U, Next in November holds the record for biggest music video debut in YouTube history earning over $55 million views in its first day.
We are driving revenue to the YouTube creator community from established channels to newly emerging ones. The number of YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers nearly doubled in the last year, and the number of creators earning five or six figures grew by more than 40% year-over-year. A big priority for YouTube in 2019 is to continue our work to quickly find and remove content that violates YouTube's content guidelines.
It's an important challenge and with advanced machine learning and investments in human reviewers, we are making continued progress. Now I'll touch on some of the recent highlights of our advertising business, which continue to go from strength to strength. Recently, Warner Brothers embedded the first full-length film with an ad on YouTube and reached a record number of people.
Over 17 million users in a single day. Viewers who watch the trailer for LEGO Movie 2 on Black Friday, were served the franchise's original film for free within the Ad. So great example of how advertisers continue to delight users on YouTube. Performance advertisers love TrueView for action. YouTube's direct response offering. Since the product launch in March 2018 over 30% of the advertisers who use TrueView for action were new to buying inc and video ads on YouTube.

In Q4, we also announced a global strategic ad tech relationship with The Walt Disney Company across their entire portfolio of brands and properties. With Google Ad Manager as its core platform, Disney will be able to serve across its digital property seamlessly. On the web and mobile apps through connected TVs and even during live events.
Our shopping tools, that are also front and center during the holidays, helping retailers reach people during the busy holiday shopping season. In fact, the number of shopping daily active users on Google.com during the holidays, double compared to last year. Thanks and part to new features like product list modules that showcase the most popular products across the web.
Small retailers are also benefiting from automated bidding solutions like smart shopping campaigns, which now has more than 20,000 live merchants. Impressive progress since launching in April. Now on to our growing hardware efforts. During the holiday season, our newest line up of made by Google Devices top many best of 2018 looks. The response from shoppers was equally positive.
It was another record year for our Google home family of devices, with million sold this holiday season. They’re helping people easily get things done around the house. For example, people use Google home devices to cook over 16 million recipes this holiday season. 1 million on Christmas Day alone. Our newest smart displays were particularly popular. One out of every seven Google home devices activated or the holiday season was a Google home hub.
In Q4, we launched significant advances in computational photography in our pixel three with features such as night sight for lowlight photos. We’ve also expanded availability to four more countries: Japan, France, Ireland, and Taiwan. And finally, our growing cloud business. I want to thank Diane Greene for her leadership over the last three years.
Google Cloud is a fast-growing multibillion-dollar business that supports major global 5,000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization. This was not the case just three years ago. What Diane and their team accomplished, it's phenomenal. Now Diane's work is done and she has handed the reins to Thomas Kurian, and I’m thrilled to have him here as our new Cloud leader.
Google Cloud closed out the strong year, with momentum across the business. Last year, we more than doubled both the number of Google Cloud platform deals over $1 million as well as the number of multiyear contracts signed. We also ended the year with another milestone, passing 5 million paying customers for our cloud collaboration and productivity solution G suite. Our focus on helping customers digitally transform their businesses is paying off.
We continue to see strong growth in all our major geographies and industries this quarter. In financial services, we signed agreements with two of the top financial institutions in the U.S to help them transition their business to Google Cloud with our highly secured solutions. In retail, brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW and Ulta Beauty are using our cloud to manage data and provide more personalized experiences to consumer.
In Media and Entertainment, the telegraph and the U.K's going all in with Google Cloud because of our data and machine learning expertise. To support our global growth, in Q4, we launched our 18th Google cloud region and announced plans for a new region in Jakarta. So as you can see we are investing in the many incredible opportunities across our business. We would also investing in communities around the world and right here at home. I was recently in Europe opening up our new office in Berlin, which will help us more than doubled the number of Googlers who work there.

Across Europe, we've invested more than €4.3 billion in five data centers since 2007. And in Q4, we announced a new data center coming in Denmark. In all, it's estimated that these data centers have generated more than €5.4 billion in GDP over the last ticket. Of course the amount generated by our creator, publisher and app developer partners across the region is orders of magnitude larger.
We also continue our substantial investments throughout the U.S. Last year, we made significant investments in new and expanded office space. In Q4, we open the doors to our new office in Detroit and announced that we will be investing over $1 billion in capital improvements to establish a new campus in New York City, which will begin to open in 2020.
We are also continuing to invest in data center construction and expansion. There is an important long-term investment that lay the groundwork for our future computing needs primarily to x-rayed machine learning across our businesses. But also to support the opportunities we see in cloud, search, ads and YouTube. More than 20 years in there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses and build stronger communities. I want thank every Googler around the world for making 2018, a great year for users and our business.
With that I'll hand it back over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric Sheridan
Thank you so much for taking the question. Two, if I could. On YouTube, you never have a number of brands in the marketplace between YouTube Premium, TV, YouTube Music. How are you thinking about positioning those brands against a global opportunity, especially in mobile to consume media on a global scale and how you’re positioning those brands for the opportunity. And then, Ruth, I wanted to come back to comment on revenue versus extends with respect to YouTube. It sounds like called out YouTube as strong in the quarter on the revenue side, but is depressed on the expense side. Was that because of licensed content for things like Music and YouTube TV, or what is ad splits? How should we think about what the drivers were there and how they’re now permanent versus seasonal in Q4. Thank you so much.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks Eric. On the YouTube question, of course, our core effort is around the main YouTube product and that is what works at scale globally across the world and we are seeing continued engagement and it's doing very well. We are committed to making sure there's a premium experience on YouTube, delivering the content people would want and YouTube Music is an important part of that as well. So we're investing in both. As you know YouTube TV is U.S only and we are definitely -- it's an exciting product. It's differentiated and has long run value for us because it brings our advertising products together including being able to serve it across TV. So we are clearly investing in areas where we see opportunity. We are pretty thorough about making sure our investments deliver growth on the other side. And so we monitored with metrics and beat engagement and revenue growth and we see a lot of opportunity here.
Ruth Porat
And then in terms of revenue it's an investment in YouTube, overall, as Sundar said, we are --YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular change the way users are consuming content and that's reflected in strong revenue growth. Brand advertising does remain the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace and as I said in opening comments, we're particularly excited about the significant growth in direct response both TrueView for action and app promo formats are delivering a great value for users and advertisers, and that's driving growth across regions and channels. In terms of the expenses, I think what you're referring to is within other cost revenues. The primary driver in the fourth quarter was the increase in content acquisition costs due to YouTube growth and that's both for ad supported content and what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. And also for our newer subscription businesses, which do have higher TAC as a percentage of revenue we're excited about the growth we're seeing here.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente
Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. One for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, if I look at the segment operating losses for Other Bets, they were higher both in the fourth quarter and for the year '18 over '17. Is it safe to assume that investments at Waymo or can you just flush out a little bit more for us if possible, were there other Other Bets besides Waymo, which were worthy of call out in terms of greater or decreasing investment. That will be great? And then for, Sundar, I’m just wondering if you could provide us any commentary about how good the Cloud is going? Any milestones? You talked about the investment there. Ruth did, I think, in terms of headcount growth in technical and sales roles and for the new leadership that you mentioned what is the things that the new -- that Thomas Kurian can kind of do Cloud to accelerate the next phase of growth in that business. Thank you so much.
Ruth Porat
So in terms of the investment levels in Other Bets, the major point is that we are investing across Other Bets commencement with what we think is required kind of looking out at the opportunity set for each one. And we go through a regular process with weekly business reviews and quarterly board reviews and try and calibrate the appropriate pace of investment. In terms of the increase this quarter, as I indicated in opening comments, we accrued some comp expenses for a number of bets and that was really to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets.
Sundar Pichai
On Cloud, one of the things that was evident towards the end of last year is now our inability to win in a very large customers global 5,000 companies with multiyear contracts. And so that's definitely something we want to focus on. I think Dyne and Thomas have been working closely on a transition with a lot of continuity, and you'll continue to see us. It's very clear to us that our product offerings are ready and differentiated and so we want to invest and scale our go-to-market both in terms of direct sales and our channel partnerships. And maybe you will see us focus more on areas where we’re clearly seeing returns. Be the geographic regions we care about the six main verticals where most of the momentum is. And within product offerings, the five major areas where we’ve clearly defined product with differentiated features to. But I’m excited at the traction we are seeing, we are getting large wins and I look forward to executing here.
Eric Sheridan
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas Anmuth
Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask to, first, can you think about the strong Google Sites growth 23%, that’s actually neutral. Can you just help us understand some of the mobile search innovations that you think are really driving things here beyond some of these underlying secular strength, with the particular focus perhaps on the retail channel, and just how you’re thinking about the opportunity there? And then, second, Ruth, just wanted to go back to your comment on OpEx. Just wanted to clarify, were you saying that headcount growth, specifically you think will moderate in '19 or are you talking about overall OpEx spending? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
Doug, on the first one, obviously we have thousands of engineers working on continually launching search improvements. I think for me a lot of this has been the clear hard work that's gone into making sure search on mobile works really, really well removing friction where we can constantly working to get the answers, a bit quicker and faster and make -- making the more relevant. So to me it's more a set of a continual innovation mentality that we’ve had there for a long time. And that’s really working at scale.

Ruth Porat
And then the specific comment I think you’re referencing is I was pointing to headcount growth. We are continuing to hire to support growth opportunities, particularly hiring engineers and product managers in Google and continuing to support growth in Cloud, and what I was just trying to draw out was we will continue to hire, but the year-on-year growth rate will moderate there.
Douglas Anmuth
Okay. Thank you, both.
Operator
Thank you. And then next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini
Great. Thank you. Yes, I had a follow-up on to Anthony's questions on cloud. It doesn’t seem like you want to share an update on the revenue run rate. But I was wondering if maybe you can share with us what you’re seeing in terms of year-over-year growth rate, and in particular are they growing faster than what the competitors disclosed in their public results? Because maybe they will help think about the pace of growth in your Cloud business. And then, secondarily I was just wondering if you can give us a sense of the types of workloads, if there's any commonality to the types of workloads, you might be running work frequently than not. Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So, in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver sizable revenue growth driven by GCP and GCP does remain one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet. As Sundar said, we double the number of GCT contracts greater than a 1 million. We are also seeing a really nice uptick in the number of deals that are greater than $100 million and really pleased with the success and penetration there. At this point, not updating further.
Sundar Pichai
Heather, I think maybe specifically a couple of examples, there's definitely we see clear strength in data management and analytics, so we can take specs -- for example, in retail or if you take someone like the Telegraph, those very important factors. Application platforms, so our ability to help customers, deploy cloud native applications has been a differentiator for customers like Unity, Ubisoft, etcetera. And Multi Cloud, ability to run cloud services across Clouds on Prem. In terms out to be very important for global multinational companies like HSBC. So we do see a wide variety of stuff. We are clearly focused on infrastructure being an application platform, data management and smart analytics, and of course with G suite productivity and collaboration. So that's the core areas we are investing in from a product and a go-to-market standpoint. And we are seeing great traction there.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak
Thanks for taking mu questions. I have two. Just the first one to go back to YouTube in a very strong quarter. It sounds like on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads. I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product, you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here. And then Waymo, got a couple of milestones. But the last 3 to 6 months, maybe talk us through how you see the next one or two big factors that you're really focused on ensuring that Waymo becomes what it could be?
Sundar Pichai
On YouTube, I still think we are in early days of making sure YouTube is better platform for direct response and TrueView for action is still early. We see great traction, but I think there's a lot more to do and I think we had a set of features which we launched last year to make sure it works better. But I think there's a lot more to do. In the long run, I think for me, YouTube is a place where we see users not only come for entertainment, they come to find information, they’re coming to learn about things. They’re coming to discover, to research and so being able to match that intent over time in a way that we can bring the right value for our users and advertisers. I think there's a long run opportunity. And we're taking all the right foundational steps to realize it.

Ruth Porat
And in terms of Waymo, as you know well, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience, and that's why we're expanding methodically. We are pleased that we’ve continued to broaden out our service in the Phoenix area and we're focused on expanding both the number of riders in the geographic reach around Phoenix. In addition, we're having conversations with a number of other interested cities and we are continuing to explore applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities, so continuing to execute as we’ve described previously.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks. Two questions. First, Ruth, could you just provide a little more color on the R&D expense build up. Anything unusual on there? Just comment on the cadence of that? Then, Sundar, on hardware that’s -- it's been a multiyear effort. It seems like it's accelerated. There's a series of these new products we try to do a report on to make sure we understood them. Could you talk about how the strategic and maybe the synergistic impacts that you're seeing of hardware on the rest of Google's business, on the rest of Alphabet's business, and do you think that it's still early days and maybe paint a picture of how significant those synergies could be? Thank you very much.
Ruth Porat
So starting with R&D, the main driver is our ongoing investment in engineers, in particular, in Google and then as I said the sizable increase in accrued comp for Other Bets and just build that out a bit more, give you a bit more color, in certain Other Bets, employees are compensated through equity-based programs. And that's because we believe that this alignment of interest is valuable. We do assess valuation on an ongoing basis. And at a minimum, we do a formal valuation assessment once every 12 months or when there is a significant event. And what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is the impact of higher valuation in certain Other Bets. And as we've talked about previously, a goal with the Alphabet structure is to enable us to build new businesses that would make a positive impact and create long-term value. And it's still early days we're very excited about the opportunities we see. And so what you're seeing is the impact here of valuation. The way we approach it is very consistent with the way startups are typically valued, and that includes technical progress and a range of other items.
Sundar Pichai
And Mark, on hardware, obviously, we are working hard to offer the best Google experience we can bringing together AI software and hardware. And you are right that it does have a lot of synergistic value, but at the stage where we’re in. The main way we do that today for our core products is by using hardware to drive where the rest of the computing ecosystem is. And so we get a very leveraged effect there. But over time, as we scale up our hardware efforts and do it thoughtfully, so it definitely -- when I look at the kind of experience we can deliver. For example, if you look at something like the Google Home Hub and how it delivers a nice experience across Search, Assistant and YouTube and Photos when you wanted, you can definitely see the glimpse of the future. And so, we are investing to realize that.
Mark Mahaney
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Stephen Ju
Okay. Sundar, just picking up on the AI for everyone theme, you’ve been highlighting at I/O as well as other venues. Are conversations with advertisers suggest that products like smart bidding are becoming a pretty -- increasingly popular tool to add to their bidding strategies. But how has the pickup been among the SMBs, especially among the local advertisers? Do you think you can target that market without a sales force? And secondarily, as we talk of two companies transitioning to a Cloud, there's increased talk of collecting data, dealing with data lakes as well as analyzing all that data to help their decision-making process. So from your standpoint running Google, do you feel like the current technology you have at your disposal is sophisticated enough to keep up with all of the needs for you to run the company as you collect all the data from across the internet? Thanks.

Sundar Pichai
I think two questions. On your first question around using machine learning to help serve advertisers better and be able to reach newer advertisers, SMBs and local advertisers. I definitely think you highlight an exciting opportunity. Whenever we’ve done work like be it last year or the last couple of years through universal app campaigns or smart shopping campaigns last year, responsive search ads, those are all great examples of where we brought ML. And with that, we made process much easier for advertisers of all sizes and we see an impact. So I think it's a natural extension for us to continue working in that direction, and that will help us reach SMBs and local advertisers better over time. So I do think that's a good opportunity. And on the second part of your question, I want to make sure I understand it. If you’re asking about how we invest in our security as a company, I think it's the foundation of how we do everything for the past 20 years. And we always -- we realize a deep responsibility that coming -- that comes with being stewards of users' data. So everything we design is designed with privacy and security in mind. It's where some of our core investments go, be it securing our data centers, literally the practices we have across the company, the quality and talent in our security teams and over time using AI itself to do all this well. So it's a core part of what we do and we take it very, very seriously.
Stephen Ju
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Daniel Salmon
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, in your review of some of the shopping products during the fourth quarter, you didn't mention shopping actions. And there were reports there that Walmart decided to leave the program recently and I think there have been some public comments on social media from Googlers confirming that. So I would just love to hear a little bit more about that. But maybe more broadly the traction of shopping actions and, in particular, the price per sale metric that you rolled out with it during the holiday season. And then, Ruth, just a quick one for you, if we could return to your prepared remarks, there were a couple of sort of things to keep in mind that you’re highlighting. One was FX going from a tailwind to a headwind, but just before that you were talking about how new experiences can rollout over time to users. And I just wanted to clarify, were you referencing an experience that’s rolling out currently, or just generally that that is a best practice in general for Google? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
On shopping, I think we launched shopping actions around, if I remember, March of last year. And we've definitely seen a strong traction there. I think we've seen roughly a sevenfold increase in merchants in the program since we launched it. And just in Q4, we announced new partnerships with Best Buy, Nike, Sephora as an example. And in terms of Walmart, we have -- Walmart is one of our deepest partners and they remain a strategy partner across multiple businesses for us, including Google Ads and we have efforts underway to work closer together with shopping. But they are definitely a large partner who continue experimenting and we will support them in many ways. But I think, overall, I’m excited about the efforts we are doing in shopping and you will see us focus more there on 2019. We see users come to Google a lot around key shopping moments and we want to make sure we invest in the experience to get closer to what they want.
Ruth Porat
And then on the second question, we've talked about this on prior calls. We've often talked about the fact that we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation. And the point I was trying to underscore is the timing and scale of the impact. It's inherently difficult to predict. And so it can be inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter. The main point is we remain very excited about the opportunities for users and advertisers, in particular, building off of Sundar's comment as we apply machine learning to solutions.

Daniel Salmon
Great. Thank you, both.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin Sebastian
Great. Thank you. Two quick ones for me. First on Project Stream and YouTube TV. Just wondering how important it will be to invest in original content as well as how you might view the rollout of 5G as catalyzing consumer adoption of these services? And then on the Discover feed, I know that’s still pretty new, but curious if you have any color on usage and engagement to date? And if there's any way you expect to monetize that feed in the near future? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
On Project Stream, being able to deliver gaming with the kind of real-time requirements, the low latency requirements, it's definitely for us -- it's an important computing advance. We think it will help us drive the newer computing platforms we're working on. And I do think, services like that will be a point of inflection as 5G rolls out as well. So I think it is a virtuous cycle. So we are excited. The early feedback our Project Stream experience has been super positive. And so we are looking to build up on that and you will see us do more there in 2019. On Discover, I think traction has been for us, we measure user engagement and satisfaction and happiness on these -- on anything new we do, and the metrics have been really strong. And we obviously -- we offer the best experience today on our products like Pixel, made by Google products. And we are looking to scale that up to reach more users. But we think we’ve a strong product there and I think it's very synergistic to search experience. And so we are looking to bring the best of both to our users, and you'll see us reach more users in 2019.
Colin Sebastian
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post
Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, it looks like Google core margins were down about 3 points and what was an easier comp. So just wondering if you can give us any thoughts on how the core advertising business is doing in there? We know there's a lot of investment in Cloud and hardware and YouTube TV, but just would like to get a update on the health of the advertising business margins. And any thoughts on if you ever do segment disclosure. And then the second question is just on the Cloud strategy. There's been a pretty big leadership change. Just wondering if there's any new strategies or new things you will be doing this year with the Cloud related to the management change? And look forward to the Cloud Conference in April. Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thanks. So, in terms of overall Google margins, I think that the main point you're seeing in the margins as we continue to see tremendous opportunity across Google, and so we're investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We’ve talked a lot in this call already about the importance of machine learning and it is a key component of incremental investment, particularly, in CapEx for technical infrastructure to support the existing -- at the existing businesses, but also the newer ones, and that's kind of flowing through here. We've talked on prior calls that we're very mindful of the fact that CapEx turns into depreciation, which is why I single this out. We are continuing to see tremendous opportunity in the ads business, Search and Ads businesses and beyond machine learning we're further investing to continue to enhance the experience for users and advertisers, and that's across Mobile Desktop and YouTube. So, for example, a big priority in 2018 was expanding the availability of content for what we call the next billion user markets, which are for us a really important area. We are excited about the growth and the opportunity to deliver experiences across markets. We are also investing to enable more visual ways of finding information, such as photos and videos. And then, we are investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly, Cloud and Hardware as Sunder has already said. So what you're seeing reflected through in the margins on the cost of revenue side is the impact of the product mix that we’ve talked about, a big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube and then on the OpEx side investing in engineers, in particular, for Google as well as on the sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just Ads, but in particular Cloud.

Sundar Pichai
And on the second question on Cloud, I answered it around Anthony and Heather's question, but to add a little bit more color, while -- maybe it's the change in leadership, but it was a well planned transition. And so Diane and Thomas together planned 2019. And the big things you’re going to see are, a continued focus on global 5000 companies. We are definitely seeing traction with large multiyear contracts, multimillion dollar contracts there. So you'll see us focused there. We will continue to invest in and expand our sales and distribution channels to meet customer demand, so that's going to be an important area for 2019. But mostly being highly focused on the 15 countries, 6 industries and the 5 major solution areas that we think will have the most impact and directing most of our resources towards those efforts is probably something you will see continued emphasis in 2019.
Justin Post
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler
Great. Two questions. First, there's a lot of discussion right now about alternatives to Google Play and Apple's App Store for distribution. And some of the large developers are starting to come up with these workarounds around the App Store fees. So, I guess, just philosophically, how do you think about the 30%? Do you think that’s the right long-term rate for Google Play? And then, Ruth, coming back to the headcount and CapEx growth moderating comments, so you have expenses growing well in excess of revenue for some time in the core Google segment, and 2018 was the lowest operating income growth since you started disclosing the segments. So are you just flagging this as a change of direction? Is this a material change or is this just a small amount of moderation in 2019? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
On Google Play, obviously, we do this at scale, thousands of developers rely on it to safely and seamlessly distribute their game to billions of android users worldwide. And we invest a lot in our infrastructure to continuously make sure their overall experience is safe and results in high engagement and for the developer's back. So I think there's a value exchange there and it's been the industry standard. And so, I think we will continue down that path and -- but obviously always adapt to where the market is.
Ruth Porat
And then in terms of the pace of investments, I’ve already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to continue to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth and just wanted to put a fine point on both CapEx and headcount. So on CapEx, as I indicated in opening remarks, we do expect the rate of year-on-year CapEx growth will slow meaningfully. So with the scale of our business and with our focus on user experience, it does require CapEx. We are committed to continue to invest in CapEx to deliver on that. In terms of the mix, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers. But the point which you asked in your question, the year-on-year growth rate will moderate meaningfully. And then, in terms of headcount, we are -- I was just trying to make clear that the growth in headcount will moderate somewhat here just so that there's no interpolation.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brent Thill
Thanks. For Sundar, the cash position has doubled the last five years to $109 billion. Yet in the last four years M&A has been right around $3 billion, which is well below your peers. And I’m just curious that it seems like the core is very strong, but is there hesitation that you’re seeing in terms of valuation or other factors that are playing into that relative to what your peers are doing right now?

Sundar Pichai
I think, we’ve always approached M&A as I think really -- we are always evaluating opportunities. We’ve a very high bar, and so to me it's been more about us finding the right fit rather than being constrained by anything in particular. But I do think it's always an important part of our strategy and we've done great acquisitions in the past. Things like YouTube and android were big acquisitions for us. And so we continue to look for opportunities ahead.
Brent Thill
And real quick for Ruth, just the magnitude of spend, I think goes back to what probably investors were most surprised by. It sounds like from your perspective you don't really look at the margin structure as having any floor, you’re just looking at this as, as you said there's tremendous long-term opportunity that you need to make these investments now. I think many are just trying to search for a framework in how you think about this investment cycle we are in right now?
Ruth Porat
So the reason I started by laying out, I think, in response to the question on margins where we're investing and how we look at is, we are very focused on investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We are very mindful of the CapEx impacts on free cash flow and earnings growth. And so we're trying to get it right, over investing, under investing neither of those works for long-term value creation, but we are very mindful of the pace here and trying to lay out work with more specificity, how we are looking at the opportunity set where -- and making trade-offs where we can.
Brent Thill

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ellen West
… fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.
Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations Web site located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Ellen. We have a strong 2018, with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners and enterprise customers.
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion or up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency, as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and Desktop Search.
For today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter: our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions: U.S. revenues were $18.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $12.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year in both reported and constant currency terms with a slight headwind primarily from the euro.
APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 32% in constant currency, reflecting weakness of the Australian dollar. Other Americas revenues were $2.2 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $17.9 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.

The key drivers were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues. Second, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation and, third, hardware related costs for our made by Google and Nest family of products.
Operating expenses were $13.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses, with the larger driver being headcount growth, followed by the accrual of compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. Growth in Sales and marketing expenses reflect increases in sales and marketing headcount primarily for Cloud and Ads followed by advertising investments mainly in Search and the Assistant. The growth in G&A expenses reflects mostly increases in headcount.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 98,771, up 4,399 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $8.2 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 21%. Other income and expense was $1.9 billion, which includes $1.3 billion of unrealized gain related to a non-marketable debt security investment. We provide more detail on these line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the U.S Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $12.77.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.1 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13 billion with free cash flow of $5.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $109 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $39.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and Google Ad Manager.
Other revenues for Google were $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year fueled by Cloud, Hardware and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.4 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 15% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, followed by changes in partner agreements offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter.
In Q4, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year, primarily due to our revenue mix shift within our programmatic business. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.7 billion, up 13% versus last year and the operating margin was 24.8%.Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.8 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities, datacenters, and servers.

Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. I'll cover results for the full-year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for Other Bets over a longer-term horizon, as we've discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.
For the full-year 2018, Other Bets revenues were $595 million, up 25% versus 2017 primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for Other Bets was $3.4 billion for the full-year 2018 versus an operating loss of $2.7 billion in 2017. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $181 million, down from $493 million in 2017 primarily reflecting investments in Fiber.
Key recent accomplishments include: in December, Waymo launched Waymo One, which enables participants to use its app to hail and pay for rides. Also Verily recently announced a $1 billion investment round led by Silver Lake as it advances on plans that are complementary and additive to its current life sciences portfolio. That investment of course was in addition to the $800 million it raised from Temasek previously.
Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. Our 23% revenue growth in 2018 was powered in particular by the ongoing benefit of innovation in our Sites business. With eight products, with more than 1 billion users each and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe.
In particular, we see significant ongoing potential to apply our machine learning capabilities across our businesses. In our advertising business, machine learning has enabled innovation in advertisers ability to match consumer intent into bit more effectively for improved ROI. It has also enhanced the ability of smaller businesses to benefit from advertising on our platforms.
Machine learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses, like Cloud and Hardware, as well as central to a number of Other Bets, most notably Waymo and Verily. Looking ahead, a couple of things to note. First, as we’ve said many times, we continuously work to enhance the user and advertiser experience because we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly, in search advertising can vary which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth.
Second, during 2018, the FX tailwinds in the first half of the year turn to headwinds in the third and fourth quarters, in line with the strengthening of the U.S dollar. Based on the continuing strengthening of the U.S dollar, we expect a headwind to reported versus fixed FX results in the first quarter, in contrast to the favorable impact of FX in the first quarter of 2018.
Turning to investments and profitability. In terms of gross margin, the biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. As we've discussed on prior calls, while the pace of year-on-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues, slowed after the first quarter of 2018. We do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search.
Within OpEx, we remain focused on prioritization in order to optimize resources for longer-term growth in sizable markets. You'll see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain concentrated in R&D. Although we expect the growth rate to moderate in 2019. In 2018, we also saw continued progress on our goal to nurture new businesses outside of Google, our Other Bets with a model of independence.

While I've said previously that there is no monolithic approach to how the Other Bets execute against opportunities, a shared principle is aligning employee interest with the long-term value creation by these companies. Since inception, this has been an important part of our approach at Google with stock grants comprising a meaningful component of overall compensation across our employee days.
We are increasingly following that approach in the Other Bets with compensation programs that align employee and company interests. You’ve seen the impact of some of those programs in the fourth quarter as we accrued compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. While these expenses will recur, the timing evaluation events is unpredictable and can vary between debts which can affect quarterly comparisons.
Finally, on capital allocation. Our primary use continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions. After taking these needs into account, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 12.5 billion of our Class C capital stock.
With respect to CapEx, we continue to invest in both compute requirements and for office facilities. Although we expect the CapEx growth rate in 2019 to moderate quite significantly. In conclusion, 2018 was another great year, with tremendous ongoing opportunity ahead of us.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Ruth. Last year, we set out to bring the benefits of AI to everyone through our products. And I'm proud of the tremendous progress we made towards that goal. From smart compose and Gmail to the new Google news experience, to call screening on the pixel and improving the overall safety of our products. AI's helping people get things done every day. Beyond our products, AI is also helping us drive our mission forward at the scale we couldn’t have imagined just a few years ago.
Google Al Lead, Jeff Dean recapped the results of our efforts in a great post on our AI block. Accusing AI to better deduct the spread of breast cancer, or providing flood victims, with real-time information in a crisis. I encourage everyone to check it out.
We also launched the Google AI impact challenge to help nonprofits find ways to use AI to solve social and environmental problems. In addition to our progress in AI we saw great traction across newer areas, like the Google assistant, hardware, and Cloud. And our core area such as search maps new use YouTube under computing and advertising platforms continue their strong momentum.
Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge. And one that is constantly getting harder. But we’ve 20 years of experience in these information challenges, and it's what we strive to do better than anyone else.
As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping uses data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems and giving people better and clearer controls. You will see us continue to do a lot more here in 2019.
Today I will start by sharing some of the new ways that we are working towards our mission. Then I will give an update on our video and advertising platforms, followed by the latest on our hardware and cloud efforts. And I will close with a few thoughts on our investments around the world. First, advancing our mission of making information accessible and useful. The Google assistant is a great example of how we help people throughout the day and we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features.

From the Lenovo Smart Clock that wakes you up in the morning to real-time navigation that helps during your commute. To a build in interpreter that translates conversations across dozens of languages on Google home. And speaking of languages, over the past year the Google assistant expanded from eight languages and 14 countries to nearly 30 languages and 80 countries. In that time, the number of active users us quadruple. As we had more partners, devices and capabilities, the Google assistant will only get better and more helpful.
There's a lot of great progress in other areas too. Last month, we announced the launch of activity cards and search. Now when you search for a topic that you’ve previously explode, you can quickly see very of already being and pick up where you left off. Thanks to our strengths in AI and Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than 1 billion products. So if you see an item that you like, Lens can show you similar designs, along with useful information like product reviews.
We continue to see great momentum across our computing platforms, android and chrome. In Q4, we announced that android was officially support affordable phones that partners like Samson introducing their first portable devices this year. We see continued traction with manufacturer adoption of android auto. We recently announced new media and messaging features to significantly simplify and improve the car dashboard experience.
And building on the speed simplicity and security of chrome OS, partners like Asus and HP, introduced a slew of great consumer and enterprise Chromebooks last months at CES. Now let me provide an update on our video and advertising platforms, starting with YouTube.
We are seeing great traction in some of our newer experiences on YouTube. YouTube music and YouTube Premium are now available in nearly 30 countries up from five countries at the start of 2018. Last month, YouTube TV announced that it is expanded nationwide to cover 98% of U.S households with the rest to follow shortly. YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly 2 billion monthly log in users.
For instance in Q4, the expanded access to tools like stories and community polls that strengthen the connections between France and creators. One of our newest tools, Premiers, is a breakout hit. Ariana Grande's premiere of her official music video for Thank U, Next in November holds the record for biggest music video debut in YouTube history earning over $55 million views in its first day.
We are driving revenue to the YouTube creator community from established channels to newly emerging ones. The number of YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers nearly doubled in the last year, and the number of creators earning five or six figures grew by more than 40% year-over-year. A big priority for YouTube in 2019 is to continue our work to quickly find and remove content that violates YouTube's content guidelines.
It's an important challenge and with advanced machine learning and investments in human reviewers, we are making continued progress. Now I'll touch on some of the recent highlights of our advertising business, which continue to go from strength to strength. Recently, Warner Brothers embedded the first full-length film with an ad on YouTube and reached a record number of people.
Over 17 million users in a single day. Viewers who watch the trailer for LEGO Movie 2 on Black Friday, were served the franchise's original film for free within the Ad. So great example of how advertisers continue to delight users on YouTube. Performance advertisers love TrueView for action. YouTube's direct response offering. Since the product launch in March 2018 over 30% of the advertisers who use TrueView for action were new to buying inc and video ads on YouTube.

In Q4, we also announced a global strategic ad tech relationship with The Walt Disney Company across their entire portfolio of brands and properties. With Google Ad Manager as its core platform, Disney will be able to serve across its digital property seamlessly. On the web and mobile apps through connected TVs and even during live events.
Our shopping tools, that are also front and center during the holidays, helping retailers reach people during the busy holiday shopping season. In fact, the number of shopping daily active users on Google.com during the holidays, double compared to last year. Thanks and part to new features like product list modules that showcase the most popular products across the web.
Small retailers are also benefiting from automated bidding solutions like smart shopping campaigns, which now has more than 20,000 live merchants. Impressive progress since launching in April. Now on to our growing hardware efforts. During the holiday season, our newest line up of made by Google Devices top many best of 2018 looks. The response from shoppers was equally positive.
It was another record year for our Google home family of devices, with million sold this holiday season. They’re helping people easily get things done around the house. For example, people use Google home devices to cook over 16 million recipes this holiday season. 1 million on Christmas Day alone. Our newest smart displays were particularly popular. One out of every seven Google home devices activated or the holiday season was a Google home hub.
In Q4, we launched significant advances in computational photography in our pixel three with features such as night sight for lowlight photos. We’ve also expanded availability to four more countries: Japan, France, Ireland, and Taiwan. And finally, our growing cloud business. I want to thank Diane Greene for her leadership over the last three years.
Google Cloud is a fast-growing multibillion-dollar business that supports major global 5,000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization. This was not the case just three years ago. What Diane and their team accomplished, it's phenomenal. Now Diane's work is done and she has handed the reins to Thomas Kurian, and I’m thrilled to have him here as our new Cloud leader.
Google Cloud closed out the strong year, with momentum across the business. Last year, we more than doubled both the number of Google Cloud platform deals over $1 million as well as the number of multiyear contracts signed. We also ended the year with another milestone, passing 5 million paying customers for our cloud collaboration and productivity solution G suite. Our focus on helping customers digitally transform their businesses is paying off.
We continue to see strong growth in all our major geographies and industries this quarter. In financial services, we signed agreements with two of the top financial institutions in the U.S to help them transition their business to Google Cloud with our highly secured solutions. In retail, brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW and Ulta Beauty are using our cloud to manage data and provide more personalized experiences to consumer.
In Media and Entertainment, the telegraph and the U.K's going all in with Google Cloud because of our data and machine learning expertise. To support our global growth, in Q4, we launched our 18th Google cloud region and announced plans for a new region in Jakarta. So as you can see we are investing in the many incredible opportunities across our business. We would also investing in communities around the world and right here at home. I was recently in Europe opening up our new office in Berlin, which will help us more than doubled the number of Googlers who work there.

Across Europe, we've invested more than €4.3 billion in five data centers since 2007. And in Q4, we announced a new data center coming in Denmark. In all, it's estimated that these data centers have generated more than €5.4 billion in GDP over the last ticket. Of course the amount generated by our creator, publisher and app developer partners across the region is orders of magnitude larger.
We also continue our substantial investments throughout the U.S. Last year, we made significant investments in new and expanded office space. In Q4, we open the doors to our new office in Detroit and announced that we will be investing over $1 billion in capital improvements to establish a new campus in New York City, which will begin to open in 2020.
We are also continuing to invest in data center construction and expansion. There is an important long-term investment that lay the groundwork for our future computing needs primarily to x-rayed machine learning across our businesses. But also to support the opportunities we see in cloud, search, ads and YouTube. More than 20 years in there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses and build stronger communities. I want thank every Googler around the world for making 2018, a great year for users and our business.
With that I'll hand it back over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric Sheridan
Thank you so much for taking the question. Two, if I could. On YouTube, you never have a number of brands in the marketplace between YouTube Premium, TV, YouTube Music. How are you thinking about positioning those brands against a global opportunity, especially in mobile to consume media on a global scale and how you’re positioning those brands for the opportunity. And then, Ruth, I wanted to come back to comment on revenue versus extends with respect to YouTube. It sounds like called out YouTube as strong in the quarter on the revenue side, but is depressed on the expense side. Was that because of licensed content for things like Music and YouTube TV, or what is ad splits? How should we think about what the drivers were there and how they’re now permanent versus seasonal in Q4. Thank you so much.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks Eric. On the YouTube question, of course, our core effort is around the main YouTube product and that is what works at scale globally across the world and we are seeing continued engagement and it's doing very well. We are committed to making sure there's a premium experience on YouTube, delivering the content people would want and YouTube Music is an important part of that as well. So we're investing in both. As you know YouTube TV is U.S only and we are definitely -- it's an exciting product. It's differentiated and has long run value for us because it brings our advertising products together including being able to serve it across TV. So we are clearly investing in areas where we see opportunity. We are pretty thorough about making sure our investments deliver growth on the other side. And so we monitored with metrics and beat engagement and revenue growth and we see a lot of opportunity here.
Ruth Porat
And then in terms of revenue it's an investment in YouTube, overall, as Sundar said, we are --YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular change the way users are consuming content and that's reflected in strong revenue growth. Brand advertising does remain the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace and as I said in opening comments, we're particularly excited about the significant growth in direct response both TrueView for action and app promo formats are delivering a great value for users and advertisers, and that's driving growth across regions and channels. In terms of the expenses, I think what you're referring to is within other cost revenues. The primary driver in the fourth quarter was the increase in content acquisition costs due to YouTube growth and that's both for ad supported content and what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. And also for our newer subscription businesses, which do have higher TAC as a percentage of revenue we're excited about the growth we're seeing here.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente
Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. One for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, if I look at the segment operating losses for Other Bets, they were higher both in the fourth quarter and for the year '18 over '17. Is it safe to assume that investments at Waymo or can you just flush out a little bit more for us if possible, were there other Other Bets besides Waymo, which were worthy of call out in terms of greater or decreasing investment. That will be great? And then for, Sundar, I’m just wondering if you could provide us any commentary about how good the Cloud is going? Any milestones? You talked about the investment there. Ruth did, I think, in terms of headcount growth in technical and sales roles and for the new leadership that you mentioned what is the things that the new -- that Thomas Kurian can kind of do Cloud to accelerate the next phase of growth in that business. Thank you so much.
Ruth Porat
So in terms of the investment levels in Other Bets, the major point is that we are investing across Other Bets commencement with what we think is required kind of looking out at the opportunity set for each one. And we go through a regular process with weekly business reviews and quarterly board reviews and try and calibrate the appropriate pace of investment. In terms of the increase this quarter, as I indicated in opening comments, we accrued some comp expenses for a number of bets and that was really to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets.
Sundar Pichai
On Cloud, one of the things that was evident towards the end of last year is now our inability to win in a very large customers global 5,000 companies with multiyear contracts. And so that's definitely something we want to focus on. I think Dyne and Thomas have been working closely on a transition with a lot of continuity, and you'll continue to see us. It's very clear to us that our product offerings are ready and differentiated and so we want to invest and scale our go-to-market both in terms of direct sales and our channel partnerships. And maybe you will see us focus more on areas where we’re clearly seeing returns. Be the geographic regions we care about the six main verticals where most of the momentum is. And within product offerings, the five major areas where we’ve clearly defined product with differentiated features to. But I’m excited at the traction we are seeing, we are getting large wins and I look forward to executing here.
Eric Sheridan
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas Anmuth
Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask to, first, can you think about the strong Google Sites growth 23%, that’s actually neutral. Can you just help us understand some of the mobile search innovations that you think are really driving things here beyond some of these underlying secular strength, with the particular focus perhaps on the retail channel, and just how you’re thinking about the opportunity there? And then, second, Ruth, just wanted to go back to your comment on OpEx. Just wanted to clarify, were you saying that headcount growth, specifically you think will moderate in '19 or are you talking about overall OpEx spending? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
Doug, on the first one, obviously we have thousands of engineers working on continually launching search improvements. I think for me a lot of this has been the clear hard work that's gone into making sure search on mobile works really, really well removing friction where we can constantly working to get the answers, a bit quicker and faster and make -- making the more relevant. So to me it's more a set of a continual innovation mentality that we’ve had there for a long time. And that’s really working at scale.

Ruth Porat
And then the specific comment I think you’re referencing is I was pointing to headcount growth. We are continuing to hire to support growth opportunities, particularly hiring engineers and product managers in Google and continuing to support growth in Cloud, and what I was just trying to draw out was we will continue to hire, but the year-on-year growth rate will moderate there.
Douglas Anmuth
Okay. Thank you, both.
Operator
Thank you. And then next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini
Great. Thank you. Yes, I had a follow-up on to Anthony's questions on cloud. It doesn’t seem like you want to share an update on the revenue run rate. But I was wondering if maybe you can share with us what you’re seeing in terms of year-over-year growth rate, and in particular are they growing faster than what the competitors disclosed in their public results? Because maybe they will help think about the pace of growth in your Cloud business. And then, secondarily I was just wondering if you can give us a sense of the types of workloads, if there's any commonality to the types of workloads, you might be running work frequently than not. Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So, in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver sizable revenue growth driven by GCP and GCP does remain one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet. As Sundar said, we double the number of GCT contracts greater than a 1 million. We are also seeing a really nice uptick in the number of deals that are greater than $100 million and really pleased with the success and penetration there. At this point, not updating further.
Sundar Pichai
Heather, I think maybe specifically a couple of examples, there's definitely we see clear strength in data management and analytics, so we can take specs -- for example, in retail or if you take someone like the Telegraph, those very important factors. Application platforms, so our ability to help customers, deploy cloud native applications has been a differentiator for customers like Unity, Ubisoft, etcetera. And Multi Cloud, ability to run cloud services across Clouds on Prem. In terms out to be very important for global multinational companies like HSBC. So we do see a wide variety of stuff. We are clearly focused on infrastructure being an application platform, data management and smart analytics, and of course with G suite productivity and collaboration. So that's the core areas we are investing in from a product and a go-to-market standpoint. And we are seeing great traction there.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak
Thanks for taking mu questions. I have two. Just the first one to go back to YouTube in a very strong quarter. It sounds like on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads. I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product, you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here. And then Waymo, got a couple of milestones. But the last 3 to 6 months, maybe talk us through how you see the next one or two big factors that you're really focused on ensuring that Waymo becomes what it could be?
Sundar Pichai
On YouTube, I still think we are in early days of making sure YouTube is better platform for direct response and TrueView for action is still early. We see great traction, but I think there's a lot more to do and I think we had a set of features which we launched last year to make sure it works better. But I think there's a lot more to do. In the long run, I think for me, YouTube is a place where we see users not only come for entertainment, they come to find information, they’re coming to learn about things. They’re coming to discover, to research and so being able to match that intent over time in a way that we can bring the right value for our users and advertisers. I think there's a long run opportunity. And we're taking all the right foundational steps to realize it.

Ruth Porat
And in terms of Waymo, as you know well, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience, and that's why we're expanding methodically. We are pleased that we’ve continued to broaden out our service in the Phoenix area and we're focused on expanding both the number of riders in the geographic reach around Phoenix. In addition, we're having conversations with a number of other interested cities and we are continuing to explore applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities, so continuing to execute as we’ve described previously.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks. Two questions. First, Ruth, could you just provide a little more color on the R&D expense build up. Anything unusual on there? Just comment on the cadence of that? Then, Sundar, on hardware that’s -- it's been a multiyear effort. It seems like it's accelerated. There's a series of these new products we try to do a report on to make sure we understood them. Could you talk about how the strategic and maybe the synergistic impacts that you're seeing of hardware on the rest of Google's business, on the rest of Alphabet's business, and do you think that it's still early days and maybe paint a picture of how significant those synergies could be? Thank you very much.
Ruth Porat
So starting with R&D, the main driver is our ongoing investment in engineers, in particular, in Google and then as I said the sizable increase in accrued comp for Other Bets and just build that out a bit more, give you a bit more color, in certain Other Bets, employees are compensated through equity-based programs. And that's because we believe that this alignment of interest is valuable. We do assess valuation on an ongoing basis. And at a minimum, we do a formal valuation assessment once every 12 months or when there is a significant event. And what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is the impact of higher valuation in certain Other Bets. And as we've talked about previously, a goal with the Alphabet structure is to enable us to build new businesses that would make a positive impact and create long-term value. And it's still early days we're very excited about the opportunities we see. And so what you're seeing is the impact here of valuation. The way we approach it is very consistent with the way startups are typically valued, and that includes technical progress and a range of other items.
Sundar Pichai
And Mark, on hardware, obviously, we are working hard to offer the best Google experience we can bringing together AI software and hardware. And you are right that it does have a lot of synergistic value, but at the stage where we’re in. The main way we do that today for our core products is by using hardware to drive where the rest of the computing ecosystem is. And so we get a very leveraged effect there. But over time, as we scale up our hardware efforts and do it thoughtfully, so it definitely -- when I look at the kind of experience we can deliver. For example, if you look at something like the Google Home Hub and how it delivers a nice experience across Search, Assistant and YouTube and Photos when you wanted, you can definitely see the glimpse of the future. And so, we are investing to realize that.
Mark Mahaney
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Stephen Ju
Okay. Sundar, just picking up on the AI for everyone theme, you’ve been highlighting at I/O as well as other venues. Are conversations with advertisers suggest that products like smart bidding are becoming a pretty -- increasingly popular tool to add to their bidding strategies. But how has the pickup been among the SMBs, especially among the local advertisers? Do you think you can target that market without a sales force? And secondarily, as we talk of two companies transitioning to a Cloud, there's increased talk of collecting data, dealing with data lakes as well as analyzing all that data to help their decision-making process. So from your standpoint running Google, do you feel like the current technology you have at your disposal is sophisticated enough to keep up with all of the needs for you to run the company as you collect all the data from across the internet? Thanks.

Sundar Pichai
I think two questions. On your first question around using machine learning to help serve advertisers better and be able to reach newer advertisers, SMBs and local advertisers. I definitely think you highlight an exciting opportunity. Whenever we’ve done work like be it last year or the last couple of years through universal app campaigns or smart shopping campaigns last year, responsive search ads, those are all great examples of where we brought ML. And with that, we made process much easier for advertisers of all sizes and we see an impact. So I think it's a natural extension for us to continue working in that direction, and that will help us reach SMBs and local advertisers better over time. So I do think that's a good opportunity. And on the second part of your question, I want to make sure I understand it. If you’re asking about how we invest in our security as a company, I think it's the foundation of how we do everything for the past 20 years. And we always -- we realize a deep responsibility that coming -- that comes with being stewards of users' data. So everything we design is designed with privacy and security in mind. It's where some of our core investments go, be it securing our data centers, literally the practices we have across the company, the quality and talent in our security teams and over time using AI itself to do all this well. So it's a core part of what we do and we take it very, very seriously.
Stephen Ju
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Daniel Salmon
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, in your review of some of the shopping products during the fourth quarter, you didn't mention shopping actions. And there were reports there that Walmart decided to leave the program recently and I think there have been some public comments on social media from Googlers confirming that. So I would just love to hear a little bit more about that. But maybe more broadly the traction of shopping actions and, in particular, the price per sale metric that you rolled out with it during the holiday season. And then, Ruth, just a quick one for you, if we could return to your prepared remarks, there were a couple of sort of things to keep in mind that you’re highlighting. One was FX going from a tailwind to a headwind, but just before that you were talking about how new experiences can rollout over time to users. And I just wanted to clarify, were you referencing an experience that’s rolling out currently, or just generally that that is a best practice in general for Google? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
On shopping, I think we launched shopping actions around, if I remember, March of last year. And we've definitely seen a strong traction there. I think we've seen roughly a sevenfold increase in merchants in the program since we launched it. And just in Q4, we announced new partnerships with Best Buy, Nike, Sephora as an example. And in terms of Walmart, we have -- Walmart is one of our deepest partners and they remain a strategy partner across multiple businesses for us, including Google Ads and we have efforts underway to work closer together with shopping. But they are definitely a large partner who continue experimenting and we will support them in many ways. But I think, overall, I’m excited about the efforts we are doing in shopping and you will see us focus more there on 2019. We see users come to Google a lot around key shopping moments and we want to make sure we invest in the experience to get closer to what they want.
Ruth Porat
And then on the second question, we've talked about this on prior calls. We've often talked about the fact that we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation. And the point I was trying to underscore is the timing and scale of the impact. It's inherently difficult to predict. And so it can be inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter. The main point is we remain very excited about the opportunities for users and advertisers, in particular, building off of Sundar's comment as we apply machine learning to solutions.

Daniel Salmon
Great. Thank you, both.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin Sebastian
Great. Thank you. Two quick ones for me. First on Project Stream and YouTube TV. Just wondering how important it will be to invest in original content as well as how you might view the rollout of 5G as catalyzing consumer adoption of these services? And then on the Discover feed, I know that’s still pretty new, but curious if you have any color on usage and engagement to date? And if there's any way you expect to monetize that feed in the near future? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
On Project Stream, being able to deliver gaming with the kind of real-time requirements, the low latency requirements, it's definitely for us -- it's an important computing advance. We think it will help us drive the newer computing platforms we're working on. And I do think, services like that will be a point of inflection as 5G rolls out as well. So I think it is a virtuous cycle. So we are excited. The early feedback our Project Stream experience has been super positive. And so we are looking to build up on that and you will see us do more there in 2019. On Discover, I think traction has been for us, we measure user engagement and satisfaction and happiness on these -- on anything new we do, and the metrics have been really strong. And we obviously -- we offer the best experience today on our products like Pixel, made by Google products. And we are looking to scale that up to reach more users. But we think we’ve a strong product there and I think it's very synergistic to search experience. And so we are looking to bring the best of both to our users, and you'll see us reach more users in 2019.
Colin Sebastian
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post
Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, it looks like Google core margins were down about 3 points and what was an easier comp. So just wondering if you can give us any thoughts on how the core advertising business is doing in there? We know there's a lot of investment in Cloud and hardware and YouTube TV, but just would like to get a update on the health of the advertising business margins. And any thoughts on if you ever do segment disclosure. And then the second question is just on the Cloud strategy. There's been a pretty big leadership change. Just wondering if there's any new strategies or new things you will be doing this year with the Cloud related to the management change? And look forward to the Cloud Conference in April. Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thanks. So, in terms of overall Google margins, I think that the main point you're seeing in the margins as we continue to see tremendous opportunity across Google, and so we're investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We’ve talked a lot in this call already about the importance of machine learning and it is a key component of incremental investment, particularly, in CapEx for technical infrastructure to support the existing -- at the existing businesses, but also the newer ones, and that's kind of flowing through here. We've talked on prior calls that we're very mindful of the fact that CapEx turns into depreciation, which is why I single this out. We are continuing to see tremendous opportunity in the ads business, Search and Ads businesses and beyond machine learning we're further investing to continue to enhance the experience for users and advertisers, and that's across Mobile Desktop and YouTube. So, for example, a big priority in 2018 was expanding the availability of content for what we call the next billion user markets, which are for us a really important area. We are excited about the growth and the opportunity to deliver experiences across markets. We are also investing to enable more visual ways of finding information, such as photos and videos. And then, we are investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly, Cloud and Hardware as Sunder has already said. So what you're seeing reflected through in the margins on the cost of revenue side is the impact of the product mix that we’ve talked about, a big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube and then on the OpEx side investing in engineers, in particular, for Google as well as on the sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just Ads, but in particular Cloud.

Sundar Pichai
And on the second question on Cloud, I answered it around Anthony and Heather's question, but to add a little bit more color, while -- maybe it's the change in leadership, but it was a well planned transition. And so Diane and Thomas together planned 2019. And the big things you’re going to see are, a continued focus on global 5000 companies. We are definitely seeing traction with large multiyear contracts, multimillion dollar contracts there. So you'll see us focused there. We will continue to invest in and expand our sales and distribution channels to meet customer demand, so that's going to be an important area for 2019. But mostly being highly focused on the 15 countries, 6 industries and the 5 major solution areas that we think will have the most impact and directing most of our resources towards those efforts is probably something you will see continued emphasis in 2019.
Justin Post
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler
Great. Two questions. First, there's a lot of discussion right now about alternatives to Google Play and Apple's App Store for distribution. And some of the large developers are starting to come up with these workarounds around the App Store fees. So, I guess, just philosophically, how do you think about the 30%? Do you think that’s the right long-term rate for Google Play? And then, Ruth, coming back to the headcount and CapEx growth moderating comments, so you have expenses growing well in excess of revenue for some time in the core Google segment, and 2018 was the lowest operating income growth since you started disclosing the segments. So are you just flagging this as a change of direction? Is this a material change or is this just a small amount of moderation in 2019? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
On Google Play, obviously, we do this at scale, thousands of developers rely on it to safely and seamlessly distribute their game to billions of android users worldwide. And we invest a lot in our infrastructure to continuously make sure their overall experience is safe and results in high engagement and for the developer's back. So I think there's a value exchange there and it's been the industry standard. And so, I think we will continue down that path and -- but obviously always adapt to where the market is.
Ruth Porat
And then in terms of the pace of investments, I’ve already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to continue to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth and just wanted to put a fine point on both CapEx and headcount. So on CapEx, as I indicated in opening remarks, we do expect the rate of year-on-year CapEx growth will slow meaningfully. So with the scale of our business and with our focus on user experience, it does require CapEx. We are committed to continue to invest in CapEx to deliver on that. In terms of the mix, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers. But the point which you asked in your question, the year-on-year growth rate will moderate meaningfully. And then, in terms of headcount, we are -- I was just trying to make clear that the growth in headcount will moderate somewhat here just so that there's no interpolation.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brent Thill
Thanks. For Sundar, the cash position has doubled the last five years to $109 billion. Yet in the last four years M&A has been right around $3 billion, which is well below your peers. And I’m just curious that it seems like the core is very strong, but is there hesitation that you’re seeing in terms of valuation or other factors that are playing into that relative to what your peers are doing right now?

Sundar Pichai
I think, we’ve always approached M&A as I think really -- we are always evaluating opportunities. We’ve a very high bar, and so to me it's been more about us finding the right fit rather than being constrained by anything in particular. But I do think it's always an important part of our strategy and we've done great acquisitions in the past. Things like YouTube and android were big acquisitions for us. And so we continue to look for opportunities ahead.

And real quick for Ruth, just the magnitude of spend, I think goes back to what probably investors were most surprised by. It sounds like from your perspective you don't really look at the margin structure as having any floor, you’re just looking at this as, as you said there's tremendous long-term opportunity that you need to make these investments now. I think many are just trying to search for a framework in how you think about this investment cycle we are in right now?
Ruth Porat
So the reason I started by laying out, I think, in response to the question on margins where we're investing and how we look at is, we are very focused on investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We are very mindful of the CapEx impacts on free cash flow and earnings growth. And so we're trying to get it right, over investing, under investing neither of those works for long-term value creation, but we are very mindful of the pace here and trying to lay out work with more specificity, how we are looking at the opportunity set where -- and making trade-offs where we can.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the General Electric Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Brandon and I'll be your conference facilitator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker Vice President of Investor Communications. Please go ahead sir.
Steve Winoker
Thanks, Brandon and good morning and welcome to GE's Fourth Quarter Earnings Webcast. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO Larry Culp; and CFO, Jamie Miller. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release, presentation and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our investor website at www.ge.com/investors.
Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Larry
Larry Culp
Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our comments are going to be a bit longer than usual this morning to help you understand where we are and where we're going. But rest assured, we'll leave as much time as we can for questions at the end.
First, I'd like to start by welcoming Steve to the GE team. I've known him for over a decade. Steve's already had positive impact here at GE and I'm sure, he'll do the same for you, our investors going forward. I'm here today because I believe in GE. There is no company on earth with a scale of GE's global reach, brand, talent and long-term customer relationships. We have leading technology in key infrastructure markets with high barriers to entry and strong aftermarket streams. We're poised to capture recurring revenues on a global installed base of almost 70,000 engines more than 70 -- 7,000 gas turbines and aero-derivatives, more than 40,000 onshore wind turbines and more than 4 million Healthcare Systems. In short, GE matters. We've identified clear opportunities to improve our performance and we are working to address them at root cause.
We have the right portfolio of strategy and I'm confident the company is capable of gaining profitable share and creating long-term value for our shareholders. So let me cover where we stand on providing an outlook. Then I'll address some of the company changes followed by updates on our results, the balance sheet, capital and power. Jamie will take you through more details on the quarter and then I'll wrap with some metrics and comments to help you frame the outlook for 2019 before Q&A.
Let's start with the outlook because investors want to know how we expect to perform financially and you should expect to come from a place of reality. Simply put the how much is important but the how is far more fundamental. We have a good line of sight in most of our businesses today including Aviation and Healthcare.
For the industrial portfolio in total, we will provide you with our outlook for organic growth and we'll do so directionally on operating margins and free cash flow. We will give you a more detailed outlook in the near term but not today. For Power, we are resetting the baseline. We are reviewing every single project and contract and digging deeper to understand costs and benefits with respect to restructuring, market and commercial execution, improvement opportunities, legacy project issues and our service operations. We're gaining more meaningful insights into the paths for near and long-term earnings and cash potential of this business. This work takes time especially with the new structure and leadership team.

In the spirit of providing you with all the information we have as soon as we have it, I'll speak to what I have found over the last 120 days. We were executing against the key priorities we laid out in June and again in October. Simply put deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening our businesses starting with Power. Remember beyond Power, it's important to recognize the underlying strengths in our businesses where the story is about enhancing our competitive advantage and delivering for customers and shareholders.
With respect to delevering, we've taken the following actions: We've reduced the quarterly dividend retaining $4 billion per year; accelerated the sale of a portion of our BHGE ownership stake raising $3.7 billion; and changed the structure of our transaction with Wabtec enabling us to retain an incremental $2 billion stake. We're demonstrating our seriousness and the flexibility with respect to our decisions to recut the BHGE and Wabtec deals in particular. We closed Distributed Power for $2.8 billion of net cash in the quarter.
For the year, we signed or completed substantially all of our $20 billion industrial asset sale plan, which had targeted roughly $10 billion in proceeds. We also announced the sale of ServiceMax in the fourth quarter. We completed $8 billion of capital asset sales and other actions in the quarter bringing our total for the year to $15 billion, which were executed at book value or better. We're more than halfway through the total of $25 billion capital asset sale program, which we expect to complete this year.
Today, we have announced that we've reached an agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice to settle the FIRREA investigation of WMC. GE will pay the United States a civil penalty of $1.5 billion consistent with our reserve recorded for this matter in the first quarter of last year. We've taken the following actions to strengthen our businesses.
In 2018, our corporate headquarters cost was $1.2 billion down $400 million from $1.6 billion in 2017. We have begun transferring a significant portion of headcount and activities that were previously managed at corporate to the segments or to third parties with over 6,500 full-time employees transferred to-date. We're confident that as we move more activity and headcount closer to those that are directly accountable, we will see additional savings.
Good examples include the recently announced agreement with Genpact around our global operations activities and the delayering and reorganization of our Global Growth Organization. Our changes in Power followed a similar approach. We have $1.6 billion of cost at Power headquarters and expect to produce that amount by $300 million for headquarter's overhead functions. And as we distribute the remaining cost to the business units, we expect that they will find additional savings over time.
We announced this week that we will be delayering the headquarter levels at Renewable Energy. And yesterday announced that we are bringing GE's grid, solar and storage assets into that business creating an end-to-end offering from renewables customers as the demand for renewable power generation and grid integration continues to grow globally. We're strengthening our senior team. We've brought in fresh eyes that are already having an impact.
We're combining new perspectives from strong external talent, proven GE leaders with domain expertise and entrepreneurial spirit, next-gen thinkers as well as leaders with deep customer relationships. From a governance perspective, Paula Reynolds joined our Board of Directors bringing extensive experience in both the Energy and Insurance industries. The majority of our Directors now are new since 2017 and I'm finding the Board deeply engaged in all matters of our business

Our audit committee also announced that they will move forward with the tender process for the appointment of GE's independent audit firm. And finally, we announced our plan to combine the digital businesses into an independently operated IoT Software business with employee equity a separate Board and the ability to raise capital and operate like a start-up. We're on the precipice of something great. We're getting a 100 years of domain and hardware expertise and growing out of our digital DNA over the last several decades.
As my friend, Jim Collins of "good-to-great" fame might say, it's a start. But we have much more work to do. So let me now share with you, how I've talked with our team about how we will do it. Number one, is managing first and foremost for operational performance. Preparing for the earnings call, my first month on the job showed me that we often start with corporate and bring in the business leaders including the CEO later. We turned that around this quarter holding operating reviews first and then preparing for this call. Those reviews were tightly focused on the how we can do and how do we get better, more so than how do we explain what just happened. Let me give you an example.
Previous P&L reviews focused on revenue, contribution margin and base cost and then, of course, operating profit. The same high-level framing I saw on the Board room. No more. We now get into much more operating detail, volume, price, mix, material and labor productivity overhead and operating expenses like R&D sales and marketing and G&A, all of which are critical to understanding and then improving the business.
The second is a focus on putting our customer at the center of all we do. Over the past few months, I've spent time with our customers in China, the Middle East, Europe and here in the US. I've learned that what they value is not always aligned with how we measure our own performance.
Take quality. When I ask about quality internally, I often hear about our cost of quality, which measures our issues rather than how the customer experiences us. We're shifting our perspectives so that we understand and measure ourselves the way customers do and work backwards from there. The third area is having fewer and more impactful priorities. GE has ambition like no other company I've ever seen and that's mostly a good thing but we need to focus our attention to more of the things that matter most, so we can move them the furthest.
At a company level, we've committed to the two priorities I mentioned earlier: Deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening the businesses starting with Power. I'd now like to address some of the areas of importance that are high on my priority list. First, our high-level financial results. We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $0.65. GAAP EPS of negative $2.43 and industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. Our backlog stands at $391 billion up 5% year-on-year with equipment at $89 billion up 4%; and service at $302 billion up 5%.
For the fourth quarter, our industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion. While cash flow was negatively impacted by the weakness in Power, we were encouraged by the strong cash generation in the other businesses. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.17 and GAAP EPS of $0.08. Jamie will take you through all this in more detail in a moment.
Next to the balance sheet. As I've stated already, we are reducing our debt levels both at Industrial and GE Capital. We know full well that our shareholders own all debt obligations across GE but these are two distinct sets of businesses with different financing needs and different capital structures and therefore we analyze their leverage separately. In industrial, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5x over the next few years.

Our Healthcare, transportation and BHGE separations can provide sources of roughly $50 billion toward that goal. Our Healthcare team continues to prepare for public company separation and that is progressing very well. We expect to monetize up to just under 50% of our Healthcare business. I talked earlier to the GE Transportation merger with Wabtec and the amended terms to increase our cash proceeds and we will sell down our remaining 50% ownership in BHGE in an orderly manner over time building on the actions, we took in November.
Overall our liquidity position remains strong with $16.8 billion of industrial cash and funding lines of $40 billion. Now on capital, we are targeting a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 4x by 2020. In 2018, we paid down capital's external debt balance by $21 billion and we executed $15 billion in asset sales at book more than half of our $25 billion asset disposition program. Capital ended the year with a $124 billion of assets including $15 billion of liquidity in line with our goal to materially shrink this business.
To be clear, we have no plans to sell GECAS. We expect to contribute approximately $4 billion of parent support in 2019. We've listened to you on the insurance front and we're preparing increased disclosures in line with peers, which will be available with our 10-K release. Jamie will cover some of that detail shortly. And then finally on Power. Let me share with you the root causes of our underperformance as I see them today and the actions we're taking to address each one.
First as I said, last quarter we were late to embrace the realities of the secular and cyclical pressures in the business. Recent data suggests that the market for new generating capacity is settling in to the 25 to 30 gigawatts range for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe gas will play an important role in global electrification but we have to resize our cost structure, our capital expenses and our supply chains to this new reality now.
As a result last year, we reduced headcount by 10,000 or 15% in the business, consolidated our footprint by 30% and took out $900 million of base cost exiting at a $1 billion lower run rate. Embracing market reality means a more appropriate revenue outlook, one that is further grounded in the reality of our $92 billion backlog rather than in the hope of new orders not yet won. Second Power faces a number of nonoperational headwinds and we expect a high water mark in this regard this year. These include legal settlements and legacy project erosion principally driven by the Alstom acquisition. There's also the runoff of the effects of past long-term receivables factoring and other programs.
Over the next few years, these effects should come down substantially. Third, we need to execute better. Running Power better means improved daily management in how we sell make and service our products. Let me give you a few examples. We had separate teams of managers commissioning new plants owning a warranty period and overseeing the services contracts after the warranty.
Now, we present one face to the customer, who is accountable for the best long-term economic answer both for the customer and GE. We put the sales organization under one leader with deep domain expertise and are coordinating better on contract negotiations. We now have more experienced people, owning negotiations and responsible for project cost. We performed risk assessments of our existing 400 equipment contracts to identify cost and execution risks. We also performed a similar assessment on the 750 CSA contracts to identify price and utilization risk.
We have overhauled our commercial underwriting processes to set more realistic commitments and returns from the start. This is hard work but I'm encouraged by the Power's team's dedication to proactively address these issues at their root cause. Fixing Power will take time and in turn will take time for the changes, we're making to our daily operations to be reflected in our financial results but we are improving and I'm confident that those changes will come.

As I've met with customers around the world, I'm really been struck by their sentiment. They're rooting for us. They want us to succeed and they want to know how they can help. So in summary, we're taking action, taking action on the priorities we laid out to you, deleveraging our balance sheet and strengthening our businesses starting with Power.
Jamie will now take you through the detailed financial results.
Jamie Miller
Thanks. Larry. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Orders were $34.1 billion down 1% reported and up 4% organically with particular strength in equipment orders up 7% organically driven by aviation commercial engines and renewables. The services orders were up 1% organically. Revenues were up 5%, industrial segment revenues were up 2% reported and 8% organically driven by renewables Aviation Oil & Gas Healthcare and Transportation.
Equipment revenues grew 10% and services were up 6% organically. Industrial profit margins were 7.5% in the quarter down 150 basis points year-over-year on a reported and organic basis driven by significant declines in Power and Renewables. For the year, margins were down 80 basis points organically. Industrial profit was down 16% in the quarter with Aviation, Healthcare and Baker Hughes GE all delivering strong profit growth offset mostly by Power. Specifically Aviation had another outstanding quarter and year expanding total year margins while shipping over 1,100 LEAP engines. Net earnings per share was $0.07, which includes losses from discontinued operations related to GE Capital. GAAP continuing EPS was $0.08 and adjusted EPS was $0.17.
I'll walk the GAAP continuing EPS to adjusted EPS on the right side of the page. Starting from GAAP. Continuing EPS was $0.08 and we had $0.06 of gains principally from the sale of Distributed Power. As you will recall in the third quarter, we booked the $22 billion impairment charge related to Power goodwill based on our best estimate at that time. And during the fourth quarter, we finalized our analysis and booked an incremental $69 million charge for Power following the third quarter charge. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $94 million in renewables at our Hydro business. Combined these charges were $0.02 impact. On restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.07 of charges principally at Corporate and Power as we continue to resize those segments in line with our stated plan including $0.02 of charges related to business development transaction expenses and $0.01 for our share of Baker Hughes GE's restructuring.
Lastly, we realized a $0.01 negative impact from US tax reform as we updated our estimate of the transition tax and other aspects of the enactment of the new law. Our current accrual reflects the effects of tax reform enactment based on guidance issued through year-end. Excluding these items adjusted EPS was $0.17 in the quarter.
Moving to cash, adjusted industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion for the quarter, $1.9 billion lower than the prior year driven primarily by a lower progress collections. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $2.3 billion. Working capital was positive $2.3 billion for the quarter as we reduced over $1 billion of inventory on a higher fourth quarter volume and grew progress collections by $500 million primarily in renewables from strong PTC-driven orders.
Contract assets were a source of cash of $900 million as we saw higher services billings in aviation driven by higher fleet utilization and spare parts consumption from strong air traffic and we spent about $1 billion in gross CapEx or $600 million ex-Baker Hughes GE. For the year, we generated $4.5 billion of adjusted industrial free cash flow and we ended the year with higher volume in the fourth quarter as is typical for our businesses. And to provide you with more detail, Power used $2.7 billion in free cash flow for the year due to a combination of restructuring costs, nonoperational headwinds as well as execution and market issues.

Next, I'll cover liquidity. On the left side of the page, you can see the walk of the GE cash balance. We ended the fourth quarter with $16.8 billion of industrial cash in the bank excluding Baker Hughes GE. And for the total year, we had industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. We paid dividends of $4.2 billion and as of the first quarter of 2019, you'll recall that the dividend is decreasing to $0.01 per share per quarter, which will preserve about $4 billion of cash in 2019. We generated cash proceeds of $5.9 billion net of taxes related to our industrial disposition principally Industrial Solutions, Value-Based Care and Dis Power. And together with Wabtec that gets to the more than $10 billion we had talked about previously.
Earlier in the year, we assumed $6 billion of debt from GE Capital to fund the principal pension plan, which was completed in the third quarter. Alstom and GE exercised their JV redemption rights and call options, which we settled for $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter. These entities operate at a loss. So the consolidation of 100% of the financials negatively impacted fourth quarter and will be an income headwind for us of about $300 million in 2019. We also completed a secondary offering for approximately 100 million Baker Hughes GE shares as well as a direct stock buyback with Baker Hughes GE for 65 million shares bringing our ownership stake to 50.4% in the fourth quarter.
These actions combined with other Baker Hughes GE buybacks during the year totaled $4.4 billion in cash proceeds. The $2.5 billion of other cash includes a number of items including about $900 million of investments in our Aviation business primarily from the first half of the year; $900 million of short data derivative hedge settlements that we used to mitigate risks across the portfolio; and $400 million of FX translation on our non-US dollar-denominated cash. Running with a higher cash balance will help us address inter-quarter funding needs. In line with our goal to reduce reliance on short-term funding, peak short-term funding needs declined from $19.7 billion in the fourth quarter of '17 to $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter of '18. These were funded with commercial paper and some utilization of our credit facilities.
As we execute dispositions in 2019, we expect our intra-quarter funding needs to continue to decline and would expect to use a mix of commercial paper, credit facilities and excess cash at GE Capital to efficiently fund these needs. At the end of the year, commercial paper outstanding was $3 billion and we had access to $40 billion of committed revolving credit facilities with zero drawn. These lines are available to draw at any time and they don't have financial covenants ratings triggers or material adverse change clauses. As you know, our credit rating was downgraded from A to BBB+ with a stable outlook in early fourth quarter.
This impact has been manageable with less than $15 million of collateral postings and a smooth transition to a Tier two commercial paper program. We continue to target a sustainable rating in the single A range.
Now, I'll take you through financial policy and leverage. We remain committed to our financial policy of a target single A rating a leverage level of less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA and ultimately a dividend level in line with our peers. Deleveraging both GE and GE Capital is a priority and we have significant sources to achieve our goals.
As Larry mentioned, we view these businesses differently with different balance sheets and capital structure needs and therefore we analyze their leverage separately. Our goal is leverage for the GE industrial businesses of less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA. We plan to make significant progress toward this goal by the end of 2020 and as a reminder when we speak about net debt, we're talking about debt adjusted for pensions, operating leases and a portion of preferred stock and cash. Measured on this basis, GE Industrial net debt at the end of 2018 was $55 billion. As we look out over the next couple of years, we expect to have roughly $50 billion of industrial sources that can be used to delever and derisk the company.

These sources include $18 billion of debt and pension transfer to Healthcare and more than $30 billion of cash proceeds from the monetization of up to just under 50% of Healthcare, 100% of our remaining stake in Baker Hughes GE and our stake in transportation. These sources will be used in part to reduce GE net debt by more than $30 billion including repaying a significant part of the $14 billion of debt transferred from GE Capital and reducing commercial paper. The parent also plans to contribute $4 billion to GE Capital in 2019 to maintain adequate capital levels there.
At GE Capital, we have a plan to reduce our debt to equity ratio to less than 4x by the end of 2020. GE Capital began the quarter with $70 billion of debt and ended with $66 billion while our total assets measure $124 billion. For the year, we made significant progress at GE Capital paying down $21 billion of external debt, taking down leverage by 1.4 turns including reducing commercial paper from $5 billion to zero.
GE Capital ended 2018 with $15 billion of liquidity. Over the next two years, we expect to generate additional sources of cash from asset sales, including $10 billion in 2019 from completing our GE Capital $25 billion asset reduction plan. We'll have cash from the pay down of most of the debt transferred to GE and capital support from GE. We have reached an agreement in principle on WMC that we expect to conclude expeditiously. And in 2019 and 2020, GE Capital will pay down $25 billion of scheduled debt maturities and continue to contribute about $2 billion per year of capital to our insurance businesses as previously disclosed. We now don't expect to issue new debt until 2021.
We are planning approximately $4 billion of capital contributions to GE Capital in 2019. This includes $1.5 billion for the WMC agreement in principal announced today and ensuring we have adequate risk-based capital levels for our current portfolio. Going forward, we anticipate funding any insurance capital requirements or strategic options through a combination of GE Capital earnings, asset sales, liquidity and GE parent support. While we have more work to do, we continue to make progress in strengthening the balance sheet.
Next on Power. Orders were down 19% in the quarter. Gas Power Systems orders were down 26%. For the year, Gas Power Systems orders were down 40%. We ended the year with a $9 billion backlog, which was down 8% year-over-year. This is consistent with our outlook for a 25 to 30 gigawatt market for the foreseeable future. Power Services orders were down 20%. Steam orders were up 61% and grid orders were down 13% for the year. Power revenue was down 25%. Gas Power Systems revenues were down 21%. Power Services revenue was also down 21%. During the quarter, we took $400 million of charges related to our CSA contracts, which impacts revenue. Excluding these charges Power Services revenue was down 11%. Steam revenue was down 30% on lower America's and Europe volume and grid was flat.
Moving to profit. The segment loss $872 million in the fourth quarter. We performed our normal CSA reviews and while total utilization on the book is flat, we have seen lower utilization on some of our units in some geographies and some pricing pressure in contracts relative to ongoing market dynamics and we updated our assumptions to reflect a revised outlook in these areas.
In addition, we had our normal cost standard updates, which included updates to our cost standards including the impact of the stage-one blade issue as expected. This resulted in the $400 million of charges that I previously mentioned. In addition, we also incurred about $350 million of costs related to Gas Power Systems projects. Similar to the third quarter, we continue to experience project execution issues resulting in liquidated damages as well as partner execution issues. Grid profit was down year-over-year impacted negatively by the buyout of the Alstom share of the JV.

These items had a significant impact on Power's results and overall, we see the heavy duty gas turbine market is flat over the next few years and see significant opportunity to improve our own execution. Next on Aviation, which had another great quarter. Orders of $8.8 billion were up 12%. Equipment orders grew 20%, driven by continued strong momentum of the LEAP engine program up 56% versus prior year. Military engine orders were up 69% driven by the F414 and service orders grew 7%. Revenues of $8.5 billion grew 21%. Equipment revenues were up 13% on higher commercial engine partially offset by lower military volume.
Specifically, we shipped 379 LEAP engines this quarter up 177 units year-over-year. And in total, we shipped 1,118 LEAP engines for the year. We're still behind on deliveries by about four weeks but the business expects to be back on schedule by mid-2019. Services revenue grew 26% with spares rate up 10% driven by higher fleet utilization and spare parts consumption from strong air traffic. Segment profit of $1.7 billion was up 24% on higher volumes, improved price and operating productivity and compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we shipped almost 90% more LEAP engines.
Despite the negative mix from higher LEAP shipments operating profit margins of 20.4% expanded 60 basis points in the quarter and 130 basis points for the year. The LEAP engine continues to perform very well with a 58% win rate on the A320neo family and 81% win rate in the narrow-body segment when you add in Boeing 737 MAX and Comac C919. Utilization rates are over 95%. We continue to improve the cost position of the LEAP and over the last two years, we've taken out more than 40% of the cost of the engine and are ahead on the learning curve initially laid out for the program. The overall program will break even around 2021.
Now, I'll provide some additional transparency on the engine transition in the narrow-body market. The mixing from CFM56 to LEAP resulted in a margin drag of approximately 160 basis points in 2018 and 130 basis points in the quarter. The business is successfully offsetting this margin pressure through continued growth in aftermarket services, military and changing the mix of company-funded R&D spend. In summary, another strong year for David and the aviation team. In renewables, renewables orders were up 19% versus prior year driven by onshore equipment up 9% and services up 32% on strong repower units.
We shipped 44% more megawatts and onshore wind and saw strong orders bookings 3 gigawatts in the fourth quarter and 8.6 gigawatts for the year and we gained share. Revenues of $3.4 billion were up 28% mainly driven by onshore wind up 34% on both higher new unit shipments and repowering volume. Segment margin of 2% was down 330 basis points for the quarter and profit of $67 million was down 51% mainly driven by negative price, liquidated damages for execution delays on a handful of complicated projects including some legacy Alstom projects and higher losses in hydro and offshore as we began fully consolidating these entities in the fourth quarter.
The consolidation presented a headwind of about 220 basis points. Recall that we had to book loss reserves at the time of the Alstom deal and we continue to burn through the negative cash flow impact of those projects. The business has seen favorable cash tailwinds from the PTC cycle, pricing is improving and we continue to see strong product cost reduction and while we're seeing some adverse impacts from tariffs, we're working to mitigate them with pricing and supply chain actions.
For Healthcare, orders of $5.8 billion were up 2% organically. On a product line basis, Life Sciences orders were up 13% organically with bioprocess up 20%. Healthcare Systems orders were down 1% organically, which was about what we expected as we were comping a very strong fourth quarter in 2017.

Revenue of $5.4 billion was up 6% organically. Healthcare Systems revenue grew 4% organically and Life Sciences was up 10%. Segment margin was 21.8% expanding 10 basis points reported and 110 basis points organically, which excluded costs incurred in preparation for a separation in 2019. Profit was $1.2 billion up 2% on a reported basis and 12% organically. Organic profit growth was driven by volume and cost productivity partially offset by inflation, price and higher program investment. As the Healthcare team continues to prepare for separation, they closed out a solid year.
Moving to oil and gas. Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning and Lorenzo and Brian will hold their earnings call with investors today following ours. Next for Transportation and Lighting. Since we last spoke in October, we signed an agreement to sell Current to American Industrial Partners and the Justice Department has closed its review of the pending merger between GE Transportation and Wabtec.
Last week, we also announced amended transaction terms to further support our deleveraging plan. GE will increase its stake in Wabtec from approximately 10% to approximately 25% resulting in increased cash proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion as we sell down our stake. We will still receive $2.9 billion in cash from Wabtec at closing and both transactions are expected to close in early 2019 subject to customary closing conditions.
Finally, I'll cover GE Capital. Net loss from continuing operations was $86 million in the quarter, including a tax reform adjustment of negative $128 million. Adjusted continuing net income was $43 million. We completed our annual GAAP loss recognition testing in our runoff insurance portfolio, which resulted in an after-tax charge of about $65 million to increase reserves.
As part of the test, we unlocked our future policy benefit reserve and updated key assumptions related to the book. The two largest drivers being the changes to our assumptions and morbidity improvement of a negative $1.2 billion offset by discount rate impact of $1.9 billion. Recall that statutory testing not GAAP drives funding. We expect to conclude the statutory testing in mid-to-late February and consistent with our existing insurance funding plan, we continue to expect required statutory funding of approximately $2 billion in the first quarter of 2019. We are managing this runoff portfolio with new management and increased board expertise and focus.
To provide additional information to further clarify our insurance obligations, we plan to include enhanced disclosures related to our insurance book in our 10-K, which will be released in mid-to-late February. We'll include a wide range of items from the profile of our book to morbidity and mortality assumptions to lapse rates, premium increases and related sensitivities.
With that I'll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Culp
Jamie, thank you. So hopefully, by now you have a better sense of what I'm seeing at GE after nearly four months, our strengths, our challenges and our strategy for moving forward. I'd like to give you all the information and views on 2019 that we have today with more to come soon. We expect industrial organic revenue growth to be up low to mid-single digits on the back of a significant ramp in renewables and continued strength in Aviation and Healthcare.
Power will be down in a flat to slightly down market in 2019. We also expect our industrial operating margins to expand. On free cash flow, we expect to face operating headwinds such as the PTC progress cycle reversing in renewables and we will spend more cash on restructuring at both Corporate and Power. In addition, we have a number of nonrecurring investments and commitments that create a drag on our free cash flow in 2019 but which will meaningfully lessen in 2020 and '21. These include transitioning to GE Capital supply chain financing program to MUFG and reducing factoring with GE Capital, Alstom pension contributions and legal settlements and the costs related to the preparation for our Healthcare business for our public separation.

We anticipate cash flow to grow substantially in 2020 and 2021 as we make significant headway in addressing legacy and structural issues while simultaneously realizing the benefits from restructuring and stronger daily management of our businesses particularly in Power. In aviation, we see 75% to 80% of the 2019 commercial engine revenues secured in the backlog, with a largely recurring service revenue stream of approximately $15 billion. We are maintaining margin levels consistent with pre-LEAP periods despite mix changes with a healthy new order book. With these in mind, we see high single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit profit growth.
In Healthcare, we expect organic growth in margins in a similar range to last year. We see double-digit revenue growth in renewables. The business is coming through the PTC cycle and onshore wind, which contributed to strong cash performance in 2018, as a result of progress build. That progress cycle will begin reversing this year, as we transition to factory production and book revenue against those contracts. However, we see price declines moderating and within the level of our product cost reduction efforts going forward. This is our baseline today for 2019 as our plan continues to evolve. As we develop more conviction around the cash flow situation of Power, we will update you in the near term with respect to the outlook for the full year.
So my message for 2019 is that the more stable businesses of Aviation and Healthcare are healthy and growing. Renewables is moving through the PTC cycle. We are working on Power and capital is shrinking. 2019 is still very much a work in progress but the company is becoming stronger. As I said earlier, the how much is important here, but the how is far more fundamental. How is about understanding and fixing problems at root cause. How is about process not for processes sake but to ensure the sustainability of our results to create enduring shareholder value. I'm proud of the momentum, I see across this company and the changes we're making to strengthen GE for the long run.
With that we'll open it up to your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And from Wolfe Research, we have Nigel Coe.
Nigel Coe
Thanks. Good morning.
Larry Culp
Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe
Morning. Lots of questions. I mean, I'm sure a lot of my questions will be picked up by other analysts, but I just want to start on. It sounds like your plans on Healthcare now are pretty defined, Larry. It looks like you're looking to monetize 50% putting an $18 billion of pension debts, via an IPO-type process. Is that now defined or are there still some moving pieces on that process?
Larry Culp
Well, I think we've talked about that separation as the plan of record and that continues to be the case today. The team is very well along Nigel with respect to the preparation for a flotation. We don't have a time frame per se to share with you today but we are spending a significant amount of money in '19 as we did last year in preparation. We're obviously proud of what Karyn and the team are doing here. Very strong top line earnings and cash performance and we think this is a business that is going to be a strong resilient performer through cycles. So that is the plan.
Nigel Coe
Okay. And then my follow-on would be, you gave a lot of detail on what you've been doing for the last few months and lots of opportunities for improvement. One thing, you didn't really touch on was pricing and pricing excellence and your one precedent of GE in the past has been may be trading price for market share. So I'm just curious, what your thoughts are in terms of improving the pricing realization going forward?
Larry Culp
Nigel, forgive us, if we didn't get into that in detail. We didn't want to overstay our welcome with respect to our prepared remarks. But when you hear us refer to profitable market share that is both an external and internal recognition. And it can't be share for share sake. And particularly in Power, I think we are acutely aware that we have opportunities both on new equipment and on the service book to basically value sell what we're doing more frequently. I got the word last night for example within Power of a project that is looking very good where we're frankly -- we are not the low bid, right? I think that just speaks to the way we're able to communicate the value of our technology. We know in these businesses from Healthcare to renewables price is a reality. We want to be smarter around pricing, at the same time, frankly when you hear us talk about labor and material productivity, we really want to push that hard and do that in line with market realities, so that we can maintain margins in light of some of those pressures.

Jamie Miller
And Nigel, just to add a little bit more color there on the numbers. Orders pricing in total for the year was relatively flat. It was actually up just slightly and it was up more than that in the second half. And as Larry mentioned, we are seeing in the numbers the pressure moderating at Power and at renewables. Power really with respect to the enhanced discipline on new projects and bids as Larry talked about. In renewables, we're seeing that pressure moderate as we move throughout the year as well primarily as we're moving through that PTC cycle. The supply chains are more stretched and that price dynamic becomes a little bit more unbalanced. Aviation and Healthcare are running as you would expect, which is strongly as Larry mentioned.
Operator
And from JPMorgan, we have Steve Tusa. Please go ahead.
Steve Tusa
Hey, good morning. So you mentioned on the free cash flow dynamics, you mentioned the PTC headwind, a bit more restructuring cash, some other I guess nonrecurring investments. Can you maybe give us some color on that? In addition, just provide some color on how much of a, I think Jamie said before about $1 billion of headwind or so from divestitures. So maybe just help us with a bit of a rough bridge from the $4.5 you did in 2018? Because obviously that sounds like it's going to be down.
Jamie Miller
Yes. So why don't I talk through the components of 2018 first in terms of really walking you through the rounding out our fourth quarter performance and we can address some of those questions. So for 2018, if you really walk the changes, we obviously had earnings. We also had working capital, which for the year was basically zero impact of free cash flow. Fourth quarter was $2.3 billion positive. As we expected with large volumes coming through this quarter. Contract assets was basically flat.
Steve Tusa
Hey, sorry. I can see the slide. I just wanted to know like $4.5 billion. Is that -- there's a lot of headwinds that Larry had talked about. I'm just curious as to maybe you can give us some color on the size of some of those headwinds? And obviously, it sounds like it will be down. Will you as an organization generate cash including GE Capital next year? I guess that's the simple way to ask the question.
Larry Culp
Yeah, Steve. And I think the simple answer the question is, what we're trying to communicate today is that we are going to see pressures both operational and nonrecurring. We are going to be back shortly when we can take you through a detailed walk in that regard. I think from an operating perspective, is worth acknowledging a lot of good performance in the number of businesses.
Clearly renewables was stronger from a cash perspective in '18 and is likely to be in '19 given the PTC dynamic. And we are going to go deep here on additional restructuring where we see opportunities to put that money to work and generate real returns. We also have some of these nonrecurring events or issues. Some of them are policy decisions like the move on the supply chain financing program. I think we've got better line of sight today on some of these legacy issues that come out of Alstom that we're on the hook or those are real cash commitments in '19 that abate thereafter and we do have the cost relative in Healthcare IPO.
So again, I think the headline is, we finished strongly. We know we got some operating and non-operating pressures and think we work through that in '19 with an eye toward a stronger cash flow performance in '20 and '21 with more details to come soon.
Steve Tusa
Great. And what do you expect GE cash to earn in 2019 and how much from an ongoing cash generation perspective, how much will they be generating?
Larry Culp
Steve, as I said in both my prepared remarks and a moment ago when we have everything locked down to get into those specifics then we'll do that soon. We'll be back to you.

Operator
From Vertical Research we have Jeffrey Sprague
Jeffrey Sprague
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Jamie Miller
Morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague
Yeah. Two from me. Just thinking about the Healthcare exit in particular. Kind of, for lack of a better term, losing that cash flow near term seems like it would create some stress on the organization. Can you give us a sense of, what you foresee as kind of the timing of the exit? And then Larry, particularly interested also on, how you view exiting the remaining 50% stake. Do you see the potential for some kind of, equity-friendly exit with that piece the split-off for example, which you might shrink the share count of the remaining company?
Larry Culp
Well Steve, I'd like to think that everything that we do is shareholder-friendly, right? I mean, we take a strong view here and you know, from seeing me in other roles that we want to create long-term shareholder value with the cumulative effect of everything that we do. I think with respect to Healthcare what we can confirm today is that we're on the path toward an IPO here in 2019. Timing is still TBD. So we don't have a date. Like me on my senior prom. I just don't have a date for you today but I think in time, we'll have more clarity.
With respect to Baker Hughes, I mean we talked about that as part of that $50 billion pool of options to go to. I think that the high probability there is for us is to sell our shares. We certainly are approached by various folks, who have an interest in a stake in that company. And again, we don't have a timetable per se to share with you today but we want to reiterate our view to dispose of that stake in an orderly manner, which again we think is conducive to value creation for our shareholders.
Jeffrey Sprague
Thanks. And just as a follow-up. I didn't have a prom date and I've been called worse than Steve but as unrelated follow-up, if we think about what you're going through in insurance right now, the comment about the statutory review. Is that to indicate Larry or Jamie that even if there is some adverse outcome as it relates to that statutory review, it would not affect your near-term funding needs and instead those would be tacked onto the tail, so to speak of what you're planning from reserve build?
Jamie Miller
Well, Jeff what I was referring to there was that, it's really the statutory calculation not the GAAP that drives the statutory funding needs. We are right in the middle of that process. We continue to expect to contribute about $2 billion to the insurance entities in 2019. We'll conclude that process over the next three to four weeks. But at this point that is what we expect.
Larry Culp
Sorry about that Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague
Thanks.
Operator
From Barclays, we have Julian Mitchell.
Julian Mitchell
Morning. Maybe as the first question on Power. I understand, you're reticent to give too much forward-looking color but perhaps give us a sense of, if you look at the reported 2018 numbers EBIT loss of $800 million free cash of minus $2.7 billion. How would you look at the or characterize to us the underlying figures for both of those two items, if you strip out charges and projects execution overruns and so on? And maybe also on that point, if you could give any color as to the separation of gas and non-gas within Power? What sort of financial conditions that separation has uncovered in each of the two pieces?
Larry Culp
Sure, sure. Let me do that and again this is very much a work in progress with a new team establishing new operating rhythms. But I would say that if we start on the service side of things, right? We've got a $62 billion backlog. We did take the charge in the fourth quarter $400 million on about a $3.7 billion contract asset book and we think that's appropriate just given what we see in the marketplace. I think we're encouraged though relative to the execution around pricing here. We have changed the way the folks in the field are compensated.

Transitioning them, if you will from volume to margin. But again, there's a good bit of productivity post Alstom that we still need to get from the combined organizations here and that work is incomplete. But that's part of that operating loss that you see here at year's end. We are clearly dealing with lower demand in equipment, encouraged by some of the share points in the US market here in the back half. But again, we want to make sure we focused on profitable share. There we took $350 million of charges around the project book and we know that we have a lot of execution here to improve just in the way these projects are brought online.
I think when you look at the vintages, we're encouraged by the progress that we see post the '16 underwriting class in terms of our margins on those projects. But that's very much a work in progress. I think with respect to the change in the structure of Power, again part of it is a cost reduction. We shared some of that in the prepared remarks but we also are getting better visibility on the underlying businesses P&L-by-P&L. So we talk about gas, we're combining services and equipment then we have the rest of our Power portfolio.
As Jamie mentioned, we now take on all the cost for grid now that we own all of it that doesn't help us at all. But now we've got better line of sight on the discreet P&L's grid, Steam, Power Conversion and Nuclear all four of those businesses have meaningful profit improvement potential and we're going to manage them from the bottoms up accordingly. So clearly, we're at a break even from our P&L perspective absence some other charges, a lot of work to do here and as we have better visibility and more conviction around those improvements, we'll be back and we'll be back here soon with respect to how that plays out in '19 and '20.
Jamie Miller
The other color I would just add there on negative free cash flow is as volume comes down in the factories and as our projects continue to work their way through, you see volume leveling but we've been in a declining frame here. So what's really flowing through on cash in addition to some of the other items Larry mentioned is a burn down of our progress billings and a burn down of our project payables. Situations where we receive projects in advance of constructing new equipment or where we received progress on projects and now we're in the phase of the project, where the payables and the costs are starting to come through. So that's also pressuring the Power of free cash flow. And as that levels that also starts to level.
Julian Mitchell
Thanks. And then my second question may be about a business, where there's better medium term visibility Aviation. You talked about the LEAP operating margin headwind last year. How do you see that moving in 2019 relative to that 160 bps? And then looking out beyond just this year anything on the horizon in terms of let's say 777X transition or NMA that you think could cause a major risk to the aviation free cash flow in margin profile?
Jamie Miller
With respect to Aviation's merger and mix you saw strong fourth quarter and when we look at the remixing that's happening between CFM and LEAP significant increase in LEAP shipments in the quarter up 88% over the prior year. Year-over-year 2.4x up and you're seeing CFM come down meaningfully over those same periods. Next year, CFM will come down again about I'd say more than 50% of CFM deliveries will be reduced next year but the LEAP also ramps from the 1,118 we had this year up to 1,800-plus. So that remixing continues to occur. We mentioned on the call that it was a drag in 2018 of 160 basis points. We do expect continued some small drag next year but again Aviation's doing a really nice job offsetting that with services growth. They're shifting in military and the company-funded R&D.

Larry Culp
We're clearly in conversations with our major airframe customers about new platforms. I think at this point, it would be premature to suggest that we're going to have a cash flow headwind a material cash flow headwind around any of those programs here in '19.
Operator
From Melius Research, we have Scott Davis. Please go ahead.
Scott Davis
Hey. Good morning, guys.
Larry Culp
Good morning, Scott.
Scott Davis
And Larry I don't buy that you're going to have a prom date. That's nonsense. Even I had a prom date. I was bald at birth. All kidding aside, the one number you gave that was new, which was kind of eye-popping to me, it was just $1.6 billion Power headquarter number. Can you put some context around that? It seems just like such a insane number. But I don't know really what you're including in that I guess as far as talking about headquarter?
Larry Culp
Well, there's -- it's a large number and again, I think we've got line of sight here in the near terms Scott to bring that down by about 300. And effectively, as you know, we've done a lot horizontally both at corporate and at the segment levels over time for the businesses. So it's not as if it's unhelpful or wasteful but there clearly is an adjustment we can take here as we move those activities into the businesses and I think over time as the businesses have true ownership for them that they are in their operating budgets as opposed to an allocation from corporate. They're likely to find opportunities for further savings. But we don't do it primarily for the cost reduction. I think we really do it to help drive visibility and accountability P&L-by-P&L. I think I've shared with some folks that early on in my tenure we would talk about Power as if it was one business. It's obviously a number of businesses. Some better than others, different issues here and there. I think we've got better visibility on those issues. It's not perfect today but as we get that visibility I think better position to take meaningful action to drive better results across that portfolio.
Scott Davis
That make sense. And then the other thing is just not totally clear is, if the New World is 25 gigawatts to 30 gigawatts, which arguably a lot of people can say the New World is 25 or even a little lower but how do you get your capacity down anywhere close to that? I mean you've got big factories, lots of capital equipment, lot of pressure from governments and unions and everybody else. Is it realistic to be able to get that down in the next two years? it's something that's closer to 30?
Larry Culp
Well, I think it is realistic, right? There are going to be a number of competing priorities and pressures but we took $1 billion of cost out last year. I think we are putting the -- we're putting up the parameters of a program to build on what we did last year. So Scott, we have to do this. We absolutely have to do this. I think we know, it's a multiyear effort but the challenge here around margins is not simply one of capacity. Right back to the earlier question around pricing. Productivity both in new equipment and in the field on services. It's a whole host of things that I think give us the optimism that we can drive better margin and cash performance in this business. But we have to prove that to you.
Operator
And from Citi, we have Andrew Kaplowitz. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaplowitz
Hey. Good morning, guys. Larry, one of the biggest issues I think that investors have had when GE is the concern that legacy liabilities will continue to surprise the company. The FIRREA agreement with the DOJ seems like a positive development in that regard, so does is the relatively small LTC adjustment. But at this point, do you feel reasonably confident that you've identified all the skeletons in the closet in a level of negative surprises are really going to start dropping moving forward?

Larry Culp
I don't think I would ever say, even on my last day here that we have found all the skeletons, right? I don't tend to take absolute positions. But that said I think you're spot on. The news today around WMC is good both with respect to a resolution and the fact that we came in right where we were reserved. So we can begin to move that episode behind us. I think we're encouraged by the results that Jamie walked you through relative to the LRT.
But again, the cash requirements really come from the stat and not the GAAP test and that will still has a few more weeks to run. But in the absence of no new news again with a lot of fresh eyes and it's not my fresh eyes we've got a new GC, we've got a new controller new to GE in their first years. I think that is a positive sign that we aren't adding to the list. We're going to be as open and transparent as we possibly can, when we find things. And we're going to help you understand what we're doing to address them but I'm encouraged by what I see and what has not arisen here in nearly four months time.
Andrew Kaplowitz
And Larry, you're pretty clear about having no plans to sell GECAS. It sounds quite definitive but obviously there's a lot of noise out there. So maybe I could step back and ask you how you weigh the urgency to get GE Capital debt down versus keeping the strong earnings stream in tact from GECAS that you have in the business?
Larry Culp
Well, I think that we're -- we're frankly keen not to comment on every rumor on every innuendo that's out there. GECAS is one business that we get inbounds on with some frequency. But frankly. We get inbounds on everything but my desk. I think it speaks to the quality of the assets. Again, I think we can delever and bring that net debt down from $55 billion to something closer to $25 billion. We've got a number of options. We are mindful of the trades when we move assets out and the impact on our earnings and cash capability. But again, you elevate to the strategic level, I think we are clear. We need to delever and we're going to work the plan that we've outlined here today and that's really is I think as simple and as straightforward as it gets.
Operator
From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we have Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.
Andrew Obin
Hi, good morning. Just a question. You mentioned that you took $400 million of contract asset writedown in Power. And my understanding is that sort of culturally is a big deal. Shall we see more of these writedowns? How far along are we in the process of evaluating the book there?
Jamie Miller
We asked our new controller, when he started to take a clean look at everything across the company. And they -- as they went through their normal standards CSA reviewed this quarter did pay particular attention to higher risk contracts, just to make sure that we were thinking about them cleanly and the right way. What we talked about on the call, which was really comprised of three different buckets were the results of that review.
So as we mentioned before, we had adjustments for utilization, some on pricing pressure and then just our standard cost updates. On the utilization side, when you look at the CSA book, utilization has been relatively flat and it's demonstrating actually a fairly healthy profile. And I think it just continues to support the base that gas continues to be an important source of energy generation. Now some geographies are impacted more by some of the renewables adoptions. And as you look at our book, our concentration of geographies isn't largely in those areas but we did see some true-ups that we took in places like California and Turkey just to make sure we were reflecting our best view on that.
On the pricing pressure, we are seeing that in some contracts. These are high margin long term contracts. And when we do go through renegotiation process on some of these, we are often able to offset that pricing with scope expansion and cost productivity. Having said that we wanted to make sure we had a realistic view of how we saw the portfolio, when we went through these reviews. We always do standard cost updating in our portfolio, that's just like you do in manufacturing. Those standard cost roll through this quarter as well. And part of that also reflected a small impact from the stage one blade issue but that's something that we had expected would happen, there as well.

Andrew Obin
Got you. And just on GE Capital. How much incremental capital? You said $4 billion in '19 but how much incremental, do you need to put in 2020 to achieve your leverage targets? Thank you.
Jamie Miller
Yeah. So Andrew at this point, we're talking about 2019, which is the $4 billion. And as we said as we get beyond 2019, we obviously understand. We will continue to put capital or expect to continue to put capital into the insurance subsidiaries. That will be funded through a combination of GE Capital earnings asset sales liquidity and GE parents support but at this point, we're not prepared to talk more fully about that.
Operator
From Deutsche Bank, we have Nicole DeBlase. Please go ahead.
Nicole DeBlase
So, good morning. So I just want to start on Power kind of a two part question. You reduced headcount by 15%, you reduced footprint by 30%. I know that pricing is an important part of the equation of getting back to profitability here but I guess maybe what inning are you in with respect to what you need to do to get to the right level of capacity utilization? And then same topic different question. What exactly are you doing to improve Power execution since that keeps coming up as a driver of weaker profitability and when might we stop talking about that piece of the margin headwinds?
Larry Culp
Well, Nicole I would say, we are in the very early innings relative to the turnaround at Power. I don't know, how else to frame it. Again, a new team, a new structure, new operating rhythms. When we talk about execution, we talk about daily management. What I'm really referring to is making sure that every day the folks in the field, the folks in the factories, the folks in the labs understand what the key operating metrics are that they are responsible for that feed into better margins both at the growth in the operating level in this business. So that takes time because it's not just a reporting exercise, right? It's a management exercise and making sure they not understand not only how they're being measured but how to go about actually getting better price, how to go about actually driving better material productivity. Execution in the field as well. Not only around cost but frankly more importantly around quality making sure we get into outages quickly and we solve issues for customers the first time and when we're not going back. Those are the source of things. And it is a big organization. It's a global organization. This is going to take a little while. But I'm optimistic that we'll see it in our operating metrics over time and that will in turn translate into better performance. We'll clearly get some lift sooner from the absence of the adjustments that we made at the end of the year but what I'm really focused on and what I think investors are to be focused on, are those underlying operating improvements.
Nicole DeBlase
Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Larry. And just a really quick one to tie up. Good progress on corporate expense reduction this quarter. Would you say that the corporate expense that we saw in 4Q is indicative of the run rate for 2019? Or are there items there that we need to consider?
Jamie Miller
I'd say it's roughly indicative. I think it'll be down slightly from that. It was a little bit higher in the quarter due to some onetime expenses we had but it's close. Little bit down from that in 2019.
Operator
From RBC Capital Markets, we have Deane Dray. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Larry Culp
Hey, Dean. Good morning.
Deane Dray
I'd also like to add our welcome to Steve Winoker and wish him all the best.
Steve Winoker
Thanks, Dean.
Deane Dray
Looks like I have to burn one of my questions, what's more of a housekeeping question Larry is in the third quarter earnings you talked about plans for an Analyst meeting in early 2019. Looks like, there's still a lot of more specifics that have to get filled in in terms of guidance and especially on the cash flow side. Maybe you're not ready yet to host that meeting. But just where does that stand and what would the timing be?

Larry Culp
Well, Dean again, I think we're sharing today what we can in terms of not only the fourth quarter but the actions that are under way and how we see 2019 shaping up. We know we're not answering every question that folks might have on their minds today. But we're not going to answer any question without a grounding and a level of conviction that we expect of ourselves and I think folks like yourselves and investors expect of us as well but we are indicating that we'll be back soon with more particularly as we work through some of the issues, we've talked about not only in our prepared remarks but also here in Q&A with respect to Power.
Deane Dray
Okay. And Larry, I appreciate how you started off the call with all the changes in terms of the management approach and the accountability and voice of the customer. I mean that's --that was all good color to hear upfront. And then my second question is on the insurance side. We've got good news, what I see is good news on the loss recognition certainly not a new surprise. How does that change? In the third quarter, there was lots of calls for how to ring fence the long term insurance risk and where that might be. Where does that stand today in terms of priorities?
Larry Culp
Well, Dean, again I want to make sure everybody understands that the LRT results here are a positive data point. I think that the stat test is going to be more important and I think we don't expect any major surprises but we'll have those results to share with you in a few weeks. This is a long term liability right? And we have our commitments with respect to the permitted practice. We're in a position to fulfill those. We certainly get inbounds here as well from folks, who'd like to take this book off of our hands. But not necessarily in a structure and at a value that would make sense for the GE shareholder. So I suspect that as we enhance our disclosures, they'll be better understanding of what this is.
Certainly I suspect there will still be some debate. But I'm optimistic that the transparency will lead to better understanding and we can talk about this in a fact-based way. People can understand what that means. Is it with us forever? Or is there a way to ring fence it is to use your word again, I'm not going to rule anything out. But I think right now, what we're trying to do is to make sure that everyone understands, what it is and what our obligations are around the insurance book. So hopefully, some helpful disclosures in that regard today with more to come in the K once we're on the other side of the stat test.

Good morning, Steve. Just on the capital guide. I may have missed this Jamie and Larry but what is capital guide for 2019? What are you expecting? And what kind of, are we expecting from say gains from the $10 billion of asset sales? So it's almost like, what's the guide ex the $10 billion on earnings? And also Jamie, what was Healthcare's free cash flow in 2018?
Jamie Miller
Well, with respect to GE Capital's 2019 as Larry mentioned, we're not offering 2019 guidance today. So that's something that we will be sharing with you in the near term but not today. And with respect to Healthcare's free cash flow, I think it's well understood that that is a strong cash flow business. It's a flow business unlike some of our long cycle and I think there's been a lot of valuation maps that's been out there. So while we're not disclosing Healthcare's free cash flow, I think you can probably come to a pretty reasonable conclusion there about what that is.

John Inch
Okay. I think we were targeting break even in capital this year and we ended up losing money. I'm just wondering, what is -- what actually changed in the mix from Jamie, when you originally thought would be break even to the loss? And also in your cash walk on the fourth quarter cash walk, the Baker Hughes free cash flow is a positive $800 million. It looks like Baker actually generated positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. So why would that be a positive? Why isn't that a negative drawing it out, it's just a technical question, I guess.
Jamie Miller
Well, first on GE Capital. We had the LRT results in the fourth quarter so that was $65 million. We actually had tax benefits of less than we expected as well. That impacted us by about $240 million. And then we had some other marks in the portfolio in the second half. So that was really the large difference between what we had expected and where we ended up. And then with respect to Baker Hughes. We are backing out free cash flow. So that might be a labeling issue on the slide there. It's less Baker Hughes free cash flow. If you back it out and you have the dividend.
Operator
And from Goldman Sachs, we have Joe Ritchie. Please go ahead.
Joe Ritchie
Thanks. Good morning.
Larry Culp
Hey, Joe. Good morning.
Jamie Miller
Good morning, Joe.
Joe Ritchie
Good morning, guys. And so just I know, you're a little reluctant to answer much on the 2019 guide. But I could just may be ask on just Power free cash flow, the $2.7 billion burn this year. Do you expect '19 to be better than 2018 from a Power free cash flow perspective?
Larry Culp
I think we're at a place, where we're sharing with you today everything that we know, everything we can commit to. And again, we'll be back with more detail particularly with respect to Power and cash soon. But we're just, we're not in a position where we're able to do that. But clearly, again, hopefully the color around the $2.7 billion that we burned last year is helpful. With respect to framing the magnitude of the task and the challenge, when we understand and are serious about addressing.
Joe Ritchie
Getting the disclosure on the $2.7 billion definitely helpful and will hopefully get some more color on the path in the near term. But I guess, if I can maybe focus then on just the onetime issues that occurred in the second half of 2018. Specifically, around the blade issue. Is it fair to say that those issues are at least behind you? And how should we think about what the call it roughly, it sounds like it was like roughly $700 million or so in quantifiable charges there. What does that relate to? Does that relate to all orders that you received so far in each turbine. Just any color on that would be helpful?
Larry Culp
Yes. Well the -- when we talk about the cost for the blade issue, it's really a function of going out and effectively replacing these blades sooner than we were anticipating, right? Because the useful life is effectively shorter than we had anticipated unfortunately. But we think we understand that. That work is under way with respect to the installed base. And again, I think it's regrettable. I think our customers when you talk to them understand, what's happened how we're going about remediating the issue in the field and I'd like to think that that is not something, we're going to continue to site with respect to the margin pressure in the business here in '19.
Jamie Miller
Yeah. And just walking back from third quarter and maybe updating today. So third quarter, we had $240 million of warranty and other accruals related to the stage one blade. We also mentioned that that we expected to experience a similar amount of that over time as the worked outperformed in our services book. So part of what I mentioned earlier on those charges includes that stage one blade issue started to come through the services updates.

Larry Culp
But there are host of elements of that
Jamie Miller
Absolutely.
Larry Culp
That update not just the very.
Jamie Miller
Yeah. It's a very small issue in the quarter. But it's just part of that that bleed off as we do the work.
Larry Culp
Thanks, Joe.
And our final question from Cowen and Company, we have Gautam Khanna. Please go ahead.
Gautam Khanna
Yes. Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Larry Culp
Good morning.
Gautam Khanna
Two questions. First, I was wondering, if you have any changes being contemplated to the incentive comp triggers for senior management as we approach the whole proxy time frame? Any changes to the PSU triggers that you're thinking about now?
Larry Culp
Nothing that we can reference this morning.
Gautam Khanna
Okay. And I was wondering, if you could talk about when you expect pricing to bottom and the transactional Power aftermarket? Or if it has already in your opinion? And how will that pricing now compares to maybe where it was a year ago?
Jamie Miller
I think that's a question that depends on geography and it depends on the scope and the kinds of work, we're really looking to do with our customers. Over the last year, as we've talked about before as Scott has come in. He has really refocused our transactional group, to focus more on in some cases less scope but higher margin work as we do it. You know, it's a competitive market but even having said that that as we have our orders come in, we're seeing order CM or margin rate up in some cases 10, 12, 15 points on our order book and it's been consistently increasing throughout the year.
Now as Larry mentioned earlier on the call, we're not yet seeing all of that drop through primarily because of field execution issues and operational issues. But these are things that we believe are fixable. And over time as we really seek to increase our share in that book, it really capture the kind of work that we want to capture the higher margin work, the operational execution piece of that we think should flow through. But with the respect to the margin pressure generally, I should say pricing pressure, these are very competitive markets that have a lot of capacity. So I think that dynamic will continue as we go through the next couple of years and until the market levels out and until we see the capacity leveling out as well.
Steve Winoker
I know, we ran out of time before we could get to everyone in the queue. So you can reach me and my team through the day. But I want to thank everybody for joining us. The replay of today's call will be available this afternoon on our Investor website. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Eaton Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I’ll turn the call now to Mr. Donald Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Donald Bullock
Good morning. For those of you I’m Donald Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you to all of you for joining us for Eaton's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman Chief Financial and planning officer.
The agenda for today’s call includes our opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the performance in the fourth quarter, our outlook and our guidance for 2019. As we’ve done on our prior calls, we’ll be taking questions at the end of Craig’s comments today.
Before we dive into that, I do want to make couple of quick passing comments. The press release for our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we’ll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of this call will be accessible on our website and available for replay after today’s call.
Before we get started, I do need to remind you that the comments today do include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Any results may differ materially from a forecast that could be due to a wide range of risk and uncertainties, and those are described in the earnings release and the presentation, and they will be also outlined in our related 10 Q filing.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Craig.
Craig Arnold
Okay. Hey thanks, Don. I’ll start on page 3 with highlights of our Q4 results, and I’ll start by saying that I’m very pleased naturally with their report this morning and another very strong quarter performance, which really rounded out our solid year overall.
Earnings per share of a $1.46 a share, up 13% from last year, and above the midpoint of our guidance. And this was driven by flows strong growth in sales, as well as higher margins. Sales are actually $5.5 billion in the quarter, an increase of 5% and this includes 7% organic growth and this was above our guidance of 6% for the quarter.
Bookings growth in the quarter was also strong, led by double digit growth in both Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. And so we continue to be pleased with our margin performance as well, which increased 100 basis points to 17.4%.
We had solid margin performance really across all of the segments and all time record margins in Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. We also generated very strong operating cash flows at $1.1 billion, up 27% and a quarterly record if you exclude the $300 million arbitration payment that we made earlier this year.
And lastly, we reported and repurchased $700 million of shares in the quarter, taking advantage of what we saw this frequent pullback in financial markets. And if you’ll recall, we had planned to purchase $240 million in the quarter to achieve our target of $800 million to $1 billion for the year.

I’d say for now, you can think about this as an acceleration of purchases and that we were planning to make in 2019. However, if markets remain weak, we’ll certainly take advantage of those opportunities as well and buy at higher levels.
Moving to Page 4, you’ll see our financial summary for the quarter. You can read these numbers for sure, but I’ll provide maybe just a bit of context here. First, our operating segment profits increased 11% and we generated strong incremental of almost 40%.
Second, segment margins of 17.4% were at the high end of our guidance range, and 100 basis points above Q4, 2017. And finally, our net income as reported was flat with prior year and prior year included income related to the U.S. tax bill, excluding this onetime benefit from Q3 -- Q4, 2017 our net income increased 10%. On page five, we’ll start our segment overviews with electrical products. The revenues grew 3% in Q4 and this includes 5% of organic growth offset by 2% in currency.
And this was really a strong finish to the year and in the end it was actually our highest organic growth rate for Electrical Products since Q4 of 2014. As we expected, growth in our lighting business turned positive and was up mid-single digits, while orders increased 3% and this was led by solid growth in the Americas.
I’d also note here that our backlog increased 15% and while we generally think about this as a book-and-bill business, this increase does suggest that we didn’t see any unusual pre-buying at the end of the quarter.
Segment margins were 18.2% flat with prior year and this was largely a result of some unfavorable product mix between the businesses.
Next, we can move to Page Six and a summary of our Electrical Systems & Services Segment. As I noted in my opening commentary, this segment posted excellent results for the quarter. The business continued to strengthen. We posted 10% organic growth in the quarter in with strength across all major end markets.
The 10% growth represented an acceleration of growth, which was above our Q3 growth rate of 9% and above the Q2 growth rate which was up 7%. And as you can see we did have some negative impact from foreign exchange and a small divestiture during the course of last year.
Orders were even stronger up 12% on strong growth and all major end markets in the Americas, and in EMEA. And I’d say that there’s strong growth in Q4 was against a very strong comp from last year where orders were up 12%.
You’ll recall from our Q3 earnings call that we noted a pause in orders during the month of September. We had expected that this was largely project timing and temporary. So things really played out as we expected in this segment.
In addition, our backlog continued to increase and was up 13%. So overall, the segment is performing very consistent with what we would expect from this long cycle business. And lastly, segment operating profits were up 19% and we generated all time record margins in this segment of 16.6%, so a very strong quarter across the board.
If you turn to page seven, we'll summarize the results of our Hydraulics business. Here, we had another strong quarter of revenue growth with sales up 6%, 8% organic growth offset by 2% negative currency. And we continued to see strength really in mobile and with Industrial OEMs, and Construction and Ag markets and in the distribution channel, so pretty broad based.
Orders were down 4%, and I would say here on tough comps and if you recall Q4 2017, our orders were up 25%. In the quarter, we did however see continued strength in Asia with orders up 10%, orders in the Americas were flat, but at very high levels. And we continue to see order weakness in EMEA with orders down some 24% as lead times continue to improve.
And I’d also add here, but this was the region where we had our most difficult comp, orders in Q4 of 2017 were actually up 38%. And so we feel once again pretty good overall about the activity levels in the hydraulics business.

Our backlog does remain strong; it increased 6% from last year. And turning to operating profits, we increased profit by 15% and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 13%. So I think the right conclusion here is that we made solid progress in this business, which was held back in some prior quarters by some supply chain issues, but that progress needs to continue and is expected to continue going into 2019.
On Page eight, we moved to Aerospace, and the business here is clearly firing on all cylinders. Now begin by noting that growth continues to accelerate in Q4 with organic revenue growth up 13% and this is up from 9% growth in Q3 and 6% growth in Q2.
Orders also accelerated, they are increasing 17% with strength in commercial transport military fighters and both commercial and military aftermarket. And our backlog continues to grow up some 13% in the quarter.
Now the business here also demonstrated very strong operating leverage with profits increasing 30% and delivering record operating margins of 22.9%. I would add that favorable mix certainly contributed to these record margins as aftermarket revenues continue to perform well, but our team also is doing an outstanding job of executing.
Moving to the Vehicle Segment on page 9, we’re also very pleased with how this segment performed in the quarter. Our revenues were down 2% with flat organic revenues, and 2% percent negative FX. The NAFTA Class 8 truck market remained very strong in the quarter and reached 324,000 units for 2018 and this is up some 27%.
You’ll recall here that revenues for our automated truck transmission business are now included in the Eaton Cummins joint venture and are not consolidated in our financials. The JV actually had revenue growth up 45% in the quarter. So our business overall is performing extremely well.
On the other hand, our global light vehicle production was down in Q4, with North America up modestly offset by slight declines in Europe, and particular weakness as you’ve all heard in China.
Despite flat organic revenues, operating profits increased 4% and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 17.9%. And finishing up our segment summaries, eMobility is on page 10. Organic revenue growth was 11% offset by 1% negative currency.
Not unexpected, operating margins declined to 11.3% as we continue to ramp up our R&D spending. You’ll recall that this new segment was created in Q1 of last year. At last year’s investors meeting, we told you that eMobility would become a new $2 to $4 billion offset of our company. And I’m pleased to say that we’re on track. 2018 was a busy year and a year where we ended ahead of schedule.
We’re in ongoing discussions with a large number of customers on new programs, and we remain very optimistic about the long term growth outlook for the business overall. We’re ahead of schedule on new product developments. These new products are allowing us to quote on a broader range of opportunities and quite frankly to move from selling only components to selling systems.
So we remain very excited about the future of this segment, and the work that our team is doing and what this represents as a growth opportunity for Eaton as we move forward.
And before we turn our attention to 2019, I would like to just take a moment to recap some of the key highlights from 2018 now which we see a strong year as a strong year of progress. First, end markets improved allowing us to generate 6% organic revenue growth and this was double the growth rate of 2017 and above our initial estimate for the year, which was 4%. We continued to make good progress on enhancing our margin performance with a 100 basis point improvement and setting an all-time record for the company at 16.8%. As a result, our net income per share of $5.39 when you exclude the $0.48 [ph] impact in the legacy Cooper arbitration decision was up 16% over 2017.

And our teams very effectively offset both the impact of tariffs and commodity inflation with incremental price. We generated $3 billion of operating cash flow and this would exclude the $300 million impact from the arbitration payment.
This allowed us to return $2.45 billion to shareholders. $1.15 billion in dividends and another 1.3 billion of share repurchases and the 1.3 billion represents 4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. So, overall very proud of the team. We exceeded our financial commitment to shareholders. We invested in the future of the business and really are building a stronger company.
Now turning to 2019. Let me begin by summarizing our growth outlook. Overall, we’re expecting 4% to 5% organic growth, and this is consistent with the outlook that we provided in Q3, 2018 during our conference call.
As we take a look at our individual businesses, we expect 4% to 5% organic growth in Electrical products, with continued strength in industrial and large commercial projects. We expect modest growth in lighting, and also modest growth in single phase power quality and small commercial projects.
For Electrical Systems & Services, we see 5% to 6% organic growth. And here our backlog is very strong. We expect continued market strength and power distribution assemblies in the Americas and in the datacenter markets globally.
We also see modest growth, in both the utility and harsh and hazardous markets. For hydraulics, growth is expected to be 5% to 6% on revenue levels that are already very strong, but we see continued strength in mobile markets in Asia and in North America.
And Aerospace markets really are universally strong, and we expect to see 8% to 9% growth on strength in OEM and aftermarket, and really, with both military and commercial customers.
Vehicle markets are expected to be flat for both North America heavy duty truck, and global light vehicles. But, both are running at I’d say very high levels, and we expect to see strong growth in the Brazilian truck market. Overall, our organic revenues are expected to be down 2% to 1% for the year, but once again keep in mind, that our revenues for automated truck transmissions are expected to grow and are now apart and reported as a part of the Eaton Cummins joint venture.
Finally, we expect eMobility to grow 11% to 12% organically, consistent with a level of growth that we experienced in 2018. And while we’re still a few years away from what we call a major growth inflection point, our optimism for this segment continues to grow as we look forward.
Moving on to Page 13, we lay out our margin expectations for 2019. For Eaton overall, we expect segment margins to be between 17% and 17.4%. At the midpoint, this represents a 40 basis point improvement over 2018 and it really places us solidly within the 17% to 18% range that we set as a 2020 goal. And I would add, one year ahead of schedule.
And with the exception of new eMobility, we investing – we were investing heavily in product development. Margins are expected to increase in each of our segments, specifically Electrical Products at 18.6% to 19.2%, to a 50 basis point improvement and Electrical System & Services at 15.2% to 15 8%, up 60 basis points. Hydraulics at 14% to 14.6% up 90 basis points. Aerospace at a very strong level already, but at 21.4% to 22% up 70 basis points and Vehicle at 17.4% to 18% up 20 basis points.
eMobility as we noted, we’re investing heavily in this segment. Margins will be down to 6.1% to 6.7% from 70 basis points, really just as a function of heavy R&D investment.
And on page 14, we pick up the balance of our guidance for 2019. So we expect our full year EPS to be $5.70 to $6 a share. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision that reduced 2018 earnings by some $0.48.

As we discussed, organic revenue is expected to be up 4% to 5%, but this growth is expected to be partially offset by some $250 million of negative currency translation. We expect our corporate costs, including pension and interest and other corporate items to be flat with 2018 and our tax rate to be between 14% and 16%.
This will result in operating cash flows coming in between $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion and we expect CapEx to be $600 million. As I noted, we accelerated some $400 million of share repurchases into Q4. So the target purchases for 2019 are now at $400 million.
And for Q1, we expect EPS to be between $1.18 and $1.28, a 12% increase at the midpoint. And for Q1, we also expect organic growth to be approximately 4% to have segment margins between 55 and 59 and a tax rate of between 13% and 14%.
So overall, we expect another strong year. And this concludes my opening comments, and I’ll hand it back to you and you can open the line for Q&A.
Donald Bullock
Thanks, Craig. Before we go ahead to operator to open it up for questions, I do want to make a couple of comments. First, we do acknowledge today, is a day that has an enormous number of peers out there and earnings announcements. So we are going to hold our call to an hour. To do that, it’s important that you limit your questions to a question and a follow up if you would, so we can be sure to cover everyone’s questions.
With that, I’ll turn it over the operator to give instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] 
Donald Bullock
Our first question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague
Thank you. Good morning. Thought very solid Craig, I was wondering, if you could provide a little bit of additional color on how you saw things play out during the quarter, obviously the quarter itself was very strong. But we did have that peculiar slowdown in September. Did you see people tapping the brakes in December as the market got wobbly and what are you seeing here in January?
Craig Arnold
Jeff, I guess you’re referencing largely what we talked about on the Q3 earnings call and Electrical Systems & Service where we did see this pause during the month of September. We’d indicated at the time that we thought that was a temporary pause, that these products do at sometimes tend to be lumpy, and we thought that, that would come back in Q4, which it certainly did.
No, I’d say Q4 was really pretty much a consistent quarter. We saw the high level of economic activity really across the quarter, pretty consistent across each of our businesses and as I’d noted, with no real significant, no measurable pre buy at all, as evidenced by the growth in our backlog.
And so, I think it was a solid clean quarter across the board, and despite the level of economic uncertainty that’s out there. Activity levels are fairly good, and in through the month of January, we’ve really seen kind of a continuation of that performance. Certainly, in the context of our guidance for Q1, which is a little lighter than the growth rate that we saw in Q4, we do think there is some economic uncertainty out there, which is essentially what we have reflected in our guidance. But by and large, activity levels across our businesses are still quite positive and quite strong.
Jeff Sprague
Thanks and unrelated. Just on tax, Rick. I mean your guidance is pretty straightforward, but we’ve seen a couple of companies getting hit by this IRS change and deductibility of interest. Is that an issue for you or a wild card or is that fully encapsulated in your guide?
Richard Fearon
It’s fully baked into our guide. One of the reasons that the tax rate jumps from roughly around 13% to 15% in 2019 is because we’re reflecting the implications of all these regulations that came out last year, some of which, I think surprise some companies. But we had anticipated that they would come out largely as they did. So that’s why we’re comfortable with this 14% to 16% range for 2019.

Jeff Sprague
Great. Thank you.
Donald Bullock
Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie
Thanks. Good morning guys. So Craig, maybe just on the EPS range. $0.30 wide versus kind of like typical is closer to $0.20. Maybe, can you just give us some insight into why you expanded the range, and what market conditions have to be in place to drive you to that towards the higher end or the lower end of the range?
Craig Arnold
Yes, I would suggest Joe that don’t really over read or read much into the fact that the range is a little bit wider. I mean, I think it’s as our EPS in absolute dollar terms increases the percentage and the range will naturally widen a little bit. But I’d say that, for us, the big variables as we look forward into 2019 that could potentially influence whether you’re on the low end or the high end of the range. It’s largely a function of what happens with our end markets.
Right now, I said we’re feeling fairly good. It was a strong fourth quarter, coming in stronger than what most had expected ourselves included. And so I think, it’s really a function of how end markets perform going into 2019, and to what extent some of the geopolitical kind of concerns that the world we’re dealing with in various kind of countries around the world get resolved.
But I wouldn’t read anything into the fact that the range has been opened up a little bit. We’re feeling very good about kind of you know the company’s performance overall and degrees of freedom that we have around things that we can do in the event of a little bit of an economic slowdown. So I would not over read that at all.
Joe Ritchie
Craig that said, that’s good to hear. And I guess my follow on, you guys cited power distribution assemblies and data centers as strong growers in 2019. I think data centers are up high single digits. This is though a little at odds with some of the announcements we’ve heard from some of the chip makers, so maybe talk a little bit about like the strength that you’re seeing in data centers that makes you feel good about the prospects for 2019.
Craig Arnold
Yes. I mean the data center market I’d say if you look at the long term trend of what we’ve been seeing in general, the whole world generates and consumes more and more data. I think it’s pretty compelling for the long term growth prospects. We saw strong double digit growth in 2018 and as well as a lot of major projects being announced. And so, as we think about data centers in general, while on the hyperscale side of the market, it can be somewhat lumpy. We do think that what we’re looking at in the form of an existing backlog and projects, that were in the pipeline, that the numbers that we’re talking about for 2019, which is kind of mid-single digit growth are very much in line with what we have visibility to.
I think the chip maker piece is perhaps one that’s a little bit more nuanced in terms of whether or not that’s a direct proxy for what we’re seeing specifically in the data center market, as a lot of the big data center companies are actually in many cases vertically integrating and doing a lot of this work themselves as opposed to relying upon third parties.
But now we feel very good about the data center market and about how we’re positioned and about the number of projects that have already been announced. And so we think it’s going to be another strong year.
Joe Ritchie
Okay. Great, thanks Craig.
Donald Bullock
Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase at Deutsche Bank.
Nicole DeBlase
Morning guys.
Craig Arnold
Morning, Nicole.
Nicole DeBlase
So I guess maybe starting with the 1Q outlook, it seems to me like the step down to 4% organic growth could be a little bit of conservatism reading between the lines of what you said in response to Joe’s question. But I guess, maybe thinking about from a segment by segment perspective, where the step down is coming from?

Craig Arnold
Yes, I’d say that as we take a look at Q1, we’re certainly seeing a step down in the growth rate. I’d say principally and Electrical Systems & Services is one of the big drivers and hydraulics, I’d say would be another one and then also in Aerospace. So those would be the three big ones that I’d say that’s a relative step down in the growth rate.
And I think, largely the way we think about it in the call is the way I answer the question earlier is that, there is a lot of economic uncertainty out there whether it’s Brexit or the funding of the U.S. government or trade disputes with China. And so, we think given the level of uncertainty that’s still out there in Q1 that you could largely see a little bit of a pause in economic activity until some of these major structural issues are resolved there.
And that’s kind of what’s baked into our forecast. Could it be conservative, it could be, but given kind of just a level of economic uncertainty out there, we think it’s prudent to plan for these issues to at least extend through Q1 and be resolved at some point and we think all of that logic is baked into our guidance for the year of growing some 4% to 5%.
Nicole DeBlase
Okay understood. Thanks Craig. And I guess, maybe my second one just around hydraulics. So one of your big distributors talked about solar power demand stepping down a bit in the last two weeks of December. Curious about that, as well as a confidence in the outlook for China Mobile to remain strong just because I think Cat is looking for more like kind of a flattish equipment environment in China in 2019?
Craig Arnold
Yes, I know China has continued to -- maybe I’ll deal with that one first before I get to the distributor one. China has continued to perform extremely well. If you take a look at excavator sales in Q4, and [Indiscernible] sales excavator, sales are up more than 20% in Q4.
Vehicle [ph] order sales up more than 10%. And so the China construction equipment market at least in terms of looking at the public data continues to perform extremely well and our business does as well. And so, we think as we look into 2019, we do think that growth rates are moderate, but we still think that we see growth in the China mobile market specifically going into 2019 and that’s kind of consistent with what we’re hearing from many of our customers.
And quite frankly, Eaton in the region we’ve done extremely well in terms of new wins and gaining some market share on platforms and that also influences our thinking as well.
But in terms of the distribution market, I can’t really speak to one distributor in one part of region. I would say that, our hydraulics business in Q4, we had growth of organic growth of 8% and that growth was pretty even throughout the quarter. And so, we felt very good about the growth rates and we did not see generally speaking, or here generally speaking of any slowdown that took place at the end of the year. It wouldn’t surprise me that there is a distributor someplace who saw a slowdown someplace. But more broadly speaking, our business continued to perform well.
Nicole DeBlase
Understood. Thanks Craig.
Donald Bullock
Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.
Ann Duignan
Yes. Hi good morning. Maybe Craig, maybe you could dig a little bit deeper into some of your end markets and give us some color in terms of where you’re seeing the strength and looking particularly maybe Electrical Products, which specific industrial markets, which some segment of commercial projects and then likewise maybe power distribution. Just so we get some color as to what’s going on out there.
Craig Arnold
Yes and I’d say that in the beginning with Electrical Products. One of the things we noted was lighting business returned to natural growth. It’s been a business that obviously we were taking some strategic steps to work through some specific market segment issues, and so that business for us returned to growth in Q4. And we think the outlook for lighting going into 2019, is that business will continue to grow low to mid-single digits.

We think that the single phase power quality business, another business that grew mid-single digits in Q4. We had order growth that was a little better than that actually in Q4. And so that market continues to do well, and then largely the power distribution components, a lot of what we sell in the component side goes into small and large commercial projects in general. And so when you think about some of the growth that we see today in our Electrical Systems & Services businesses, mainly most of the components that support that business come through our Electrical Products business, and some of that goes to distribution is aftermarket as well. And so that business continues to do well.
So we saw generally speaking, pretty decent growth as I mentioned the strongest growth that we’ve seen since 2014 in Electrical Products and the orders are performing solidly. And so, we think that market continues to have a decent year in 2019.
In Electrical Systems & Services and it’s really as I mentioned almost strength across the board. Large industrial projects, commercial projects, those markets continue to perform extremely well, and you see many of the same data streams that we see, non-res construction numbers continue to be up strongly mid-to-high single digits. The Dodge non-res contracts on -- were up 23% in dollars in Q4, and on a square footage basis up 10%.
And so we’re really seeing strength in most of the non-res construction markets and as we talked about in data centers hyper scale and data centers in general had very strong results, up strong double digits in 2018 and we think a little bit of moderation in that growth rate as we move into 2019, but still strong growth.
And so we think in general, these businesses continue to perform very well and that no real evidence of any economic slowdown at this point. And so we’re feeling very good about 2019.
And then [Indiscernible] what your own guess is another one of those segments that’s been a lot of stuff talked about, but we had very good growth in Q4 and our [Indiscernible] business up, strong, single digits, high single digits. And so that business as well despite a little bit of pullback in oil and gas prices at the end of the year, we saw some recovery in December. And so we think that market also continues to grow going into 2019.
Ann Duignan
Okay, that’s good color. I appreciate that. And then just to follow up on that sustainability of aerospace margins. I mean we know it’s great that high margins in aerospace, but we also know we have to be investing in the future, so can you just talk Craig maybe about the near-term maybe positive mix versus the longer term. You need to be on the next platform in order to sustain those high margins?
Craig Arnold
Absolutely, and appreciate the question. I think there’s two things that are really driving the high margins in aerospace. I think one, it is the fact that aftermarket is continuing to perform extremely well. In better than most I mean at the end of the day, you make most of your money in aerospace and aftermarket, and an aftermarket is performing extremely well both in commercial and in on the military side.
The other thing that I’d say that we and others are getting a real benefit from right now is really what you alluded to and it’s the fact that we’re in a bit of a pause period as an industry in terms of new programs.
We went through a massive refresh over the last 10 years, and most of these new programs are actually going into service at this point in time, and the next, by the time you get to the next generation, the next refresh you’re probably 5 years to 10 years out. And so I do think that our aerospace margins will continue to be at very high levels for the next number of years and until we get to the point where we have the next round of major investments required for the next generation of commercial and/or military aircraft.

And so, we are investing in the future. We’re doing a lot of investments in offline technology development to be ready, for insertion to get to a technology readiness level that says that we’re ready to participate on the new platforms. But I say it’s really those two things that are really benefiting our business as well as very strong execution by our operational teams.
Ann Duignan
Right. Thank you. I leave it there. I appreciate there.
Donald Bullock
Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe
Thanks guys. Good morning.
Craig Arnold
Hi.
Nigel Coe
So, what a difference [Indiscernible]. I’m just trying to understand the turnaround in ESS because it feels like there’s probably economic concerns in the U.S. than there was back in September, October. So I'm wondering what are you hearing from fields, your sales, engineers, customers whatever in terms of what cause the pause and why there risk now? And maybe just in terms commenting on creep activity this quarter pull ahead a price increases as such. Did you see any of that? And could that explain some of this pressure?
Craig Arnold
I’d say – Nigel, I appreciate the question. We spend the fair amount of time talking about Q3 earnings call. And I think the way we characterize it at the time was we said the business we thought was in fine shape, at least that we saw a specific pause in the month of September and the business tends to be lumpy anyway and we try to encourage everyone to the look through September and say everything will be fine, which is to way it turned out. And so, I wish I could give you the exact answer to why we saw this pause in the month of September other than saying at sometimes it does happen in these big systems businesses where orders tend to be lumpy. But by and large I think what we characterize in Q3 what that our Electrical System & Services business was doing great. It was in fine shape. And we expected that we would continue to post strong growth in that long cycle business and that's essentially what’s happened.
Now and to the point around pull ahead, we’re not really seeing any pull aheads at all. We talked about. As we continue to build backlog in that business. It’s up some 13% from last year. And so I that would, the way I characterize Electrical Systems & Services is once again very much like long cycle business. Its performing as expected and you will occasionally find a month or so where things tend to be lumpy.
Nigel Coe
Okay. That’s great color. Thanks Craig. And then just maybe address price and in particular lighting price. I feel that lighting price is getting a lot better. And so I just appreciate your comment in what you're seeing in term of demand for lighting, obviously low single-digit since 2019, but specifically the price component of that what you’re seeing in the market?
Craig Arnold
Yes. I would say that lighting prices in general and some of this could be as a function of trade and other things that are perhaps putting a little bit of a floor underneath some of the pressure that have been coming historically from the Chinese import, but yes, I would say that it did has the pressures in around lighting have somewhat abated. It still remains a very competitive industry and historically speaking if you recall in this business a lot of the lighting price get back was really a function of the fact that the price of semiconductors and electronics in general continued to fall and those prices were essentially passed on to our customers and to the consumers in the form of lower prices of LEDs.
And so some of that is also that the price of the core electronic component is not falling at the rate that it has historically and we reached a little bit about bottom on some of that. And I think that also influencing the fact that lighting prices are foaming somewhat. We did have a much better Q4 with the mid-single digit growth. Our outlook going forward is low to mid single-digit and so we do think that the lighting business performs better for sure going into 2019 even it becomes no longer a headwind for the business becomes a little bit of a tailwind with respect to growth and so we’re enthuse by that.

Nigel Coe
Okay. I’ll leave it that. Thanks Craig.
Donald Bullock
Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell
Hi. Good morning.
Craig Arnold
Good morning, Julian.
Julian Mitchell
Good morning. Maybe just the first question around the hydraulics business in the margin profile, as you said you had some operating inefficiencies in 2017 and 2018. If you could quantify at all what kind of margin headwind they comprised in 2018? And how quickly you catch up from those in 2019 and may be any other respects in which it changing how you sort of manage the productivity and the manufacturing pull-through in that business?
Craig Arnold
Yes. I appreciate the question, Julian, because this is obviously been one of the segment that we spend quite a bit of time talking about during the course of our earnings calls and one of the segments were we did in fact reduce our guidance for the year. And the way we characterize and then, I think it's the largely the case Julian, is that, this industry went through a very significant ramp of V-shaped [ph] recovery the supply chain and our supplier to many cases were just not ready for the ramp. And so we had a lot of inefficiencies in the business as a function of having to expedite parts. We had some challenges in ramping up hiring, not only in our facilities, but our suppliers had the same issues. And so there was just a whole host of inefficiencies associated with an industry that went through a V shape recovery and we were all caught a little bit flat footed.
And as a result of that, those inefficiencies I’d say, if you think about the reduction in our margin guidance for hydraulics during the course of the year, you can largely say that is about equivalent to the level of inefficiencies that we saw in the business.
And as one of the reasons why we as we look at the guidance for 2019, we think most of those efficiencies come out of this system and we would get to a business once again that’s performing more like what we would expect.
And so I’d say that, while we’re not 100% out of the woods, most of the issues that we dealt with doing a course of 2018 and the efficiencies therein are largely behind us now.
Julian Mitchell
Thank you. And then my second question. I think a lot of the Q&A so far has been on demand dynamics, so maybe switch to talking about capital deployment a little bit. You did some accelerated share buyback spend in Q4 when the price was down and obviously you’ve seen a good rebound since so the timing looks very good on that. Maybe flesh out a little bit how you are thinking about buybacks versus M&A and what kind of M&A appetite you have looking out this year?
Craig Arnold
Yes. Appreciate the question. No we did like, you articulate we saw the overdone Q4 pullback as a real buying opportunity and we did take that opportunity to accelerate some planned purchases into the end of the year. And I’d say, if you think about a capital deployment strategy, I think we’ve laid that out historically and we talked about, as we think about capital deployment. The first call on cash will always be reinvesting in each of our businesses, and making sure that every one of our businesses has the capital that they need to be successful and the win in the marketplace.
With respect to M&A versus share buyback, we have been out of the M&A market for the last several years. We do -- I would say that the environment today is such that we’re looking at perhaps more opportunities and more deals in than ever. Pricing continues in some cases to still be a challenge and we've agreed that we’re going to maintain our pricing discipline through this period of perhaps pricing being above what we think is reasonable.
We’ve said that our cost of capital is anywhere from 8% to 9%. We want a minimum of 300 basis points over our cost of capital. And so we’re going to be disciplined through this period. But having said that, we would like to get back into the M&A market, and the way I would think about it is our priority will be largely around bolt on acquisitions where you get a lot of leverage within our existing businesses, and therefore we can deliver synergies and value in these acquisitions that we acquire.

But having said that, in the event that we’re not able to put capital to work through M&A, we will generate as I mentioned a lot of free cash flow in 2019. We won’t let capital build up on the balance sheet. And so we’ll certainly in the event that we’re not successful in the M&A market, we’ll certainly be more aggressive in buying back our shares.
Richard Fearon
And Julian, if I might add. We brought our debt levels actually even a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated after Cooper. And if you just do a quick little math of our midpoint of 3.2 operating cash flow on takeout CapEx, takeout of about 600 million, takeout dividends, take out the 400 million repurchases, it leaves us with about $1 billion of just excess cash to use on acquisitions or if we don’t find them presumably raising our repurchase amount.
Craig Arnold
I might add to that Rick, and we’ve been, we’ve been quite aggressive quite frankly. If you take a look over the last four years, in aggregate, we’ve we bought back some 13% of our shares over the last four years. And so we are certainly willing to step in, when we see these opportunities of weakness, and buy the stock back and given our dividend yield and the current stock prices, we think that it’s a tremendous value to buy Eaton at these levels.
Julian Mitchell
Great. Thank you very much.
Donald Bullock
Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore.
David Raso
Hi. Good morning. I apologize, had phone issues earlier, so I apologize if this has been asked. Just trying to figure out the first quarter organic is slower than the full year. So obviously there's some assumption of some reacceleration as the year goes on. But the comps don't really get any easier. You mentioned ESS starts the year little bit slower on the step down, but the backlog for that business has been up double-digit for three quarters the orders have been the obviously lumpy in the third quarter, but two of the three quarters have been strong. So I am just maybe trying to dig into little bit more why ESS organic slows that much in the first quarter? And if we think of the businesses that you said maybe they start a little bit of a pause period, the acceleration in growth as the year goes on, is that more ESS? Is it aerospace? Just try to understand so that we have a cadence correct?
Craig Arnold
I appreciate the question, Dave and we did talk about this little bit earlier. And I think it’s really we talked about this. The level of economic uncertainty that exist in the marketplace right now across so many parts of the world that’s really giving us a little bit of a pause with respect to how aggressive we are on this Q1 number. And so I'd say it's really that issue more than anything that has been baked into thinking around acceleration. I mean, you have Brexit coming up. You have trade disputes with China. You have debt issues in the U.S. and so there’s a so many, I’d say, let’s call it geopolitical issues that we’re dealing with around the world that we thought that it would potentially have an impact on Q1 activity levels and that's really what’s baked into our thinking.
David Raso
Well, I guess more directly. I’m just trying to figure out. Is there something you're actually saying, meaning anything reflective of what we saw on September? Maybe the backlog that you have -- have a little more -- they are little bit further out than traditional. I’m just trying understand how much is – again prudent understanding of some economic uncertainty right now versus something you're actually saying? That’s what I’m trying to dig into.
Craig Arnold
Yes. No. I'd say that if you characterized the backlog there’s really been nothing in terms of the characterization of the backlog whether that's in Electrical Systems & Services or hydraulics or the other businesses where we build backlog. The characterization and delivery timeframe of our backlog does not look significantly different than it looked historically.

David Raso
Okay. Now I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Donald Bullock
Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.
Steve Volkmann
Hi. Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So, just may be related to that. I mean, historically I guess when ESS orders start to ramp up and backlog stretches out a little bit there's an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive with pricing. Can you just talk about what pricing looks like in your order book in ESS? And how much that might have some upside going forward?
Craig Arnold
Yes. I think the way we generally think about pricing in general, Steve, is that, as to me there are net positive or net negative as we tend to over time offset commodity driven cost increases with price in the marketplace. And I would say today the pricing environment overall on Electrical Systems & Services is better than it's been, better than it’s been largely because of the level of economic activity overall has been better over the last 12 months or so. So, I'd say, as we think about price in general I wouldn't really think about it being a big contributor to pricing, but I think the overall environment today makes it a little bit easier as we think about negotiating with on large projects and with customers simply because from a capacity standpoint, in many cases we’re sold out, our competitors have sold out lead-times and in some cases have pushed out. And so I do think the environment overall is a little better as a function of volume more than anything else in our factories.
Steve Volkmann
Okay. All right. Fair enough and maybe I’ll ask only eMobility question. Obviously there's lots of platforms that are getting announced for the early 20s. Is it too early for you guys to have actually signed any contracts for any of those platforms? Or is that actually happening?
Craig Arnold
Yes. I'd say that, we have signed some contracts already. Most of what we signed to-date there’s been relatively small, but I'd ask you to stay tune.
Steve Volkmann
I will stay tune. Thank you.
Donald Bullock
Next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.
Jeff Hammond
Hey, morning guys.
Craig Arnold
Hi.
Jeff Hammond
Hey. Just a couple of final point questions. One, your margins in EPG looked a little bit lighter on the incremental, any anything there to point out?
Richard Fearon
What I try to comment on that one, Jeff, appreciate the question, because as you mentioned margins were a little bit lighter than we anticipated as well. And this is largely a function of product mix. And as you think about that to be a very large segment and when you have some of the segments that have lower overall margins growing a little faster; lighting for example that tend to have an impact on your margins overall. But I'd say, overall absolutely nothing to worry about there. The margins in EP are at very high levels and as you saw our guidance going forward we feel very good about 2019.
Jeff Hammond
Okay. Then vehicle, looks like you’re calling for the markets to be flat to up and yet organic decline is -- anything to read into that in terms of share shift? Or is that just the Cummins JV moving around?
Craig Arnold
Yes. It’s really the Cummins JV. And it’s another question I appreciate, Jeff, because there has been a little bit of confusion around the way the JV impact easting it. So as the JV increases, as the world continues to consume and move from more manual transmissions to automated transmissions that revenue ends up showing up in the joint venture as I mentioned that the JV revenues grew 45% in Q4. And so we obviously get piece of the profits, but you’ll find it as we move forward the revenues for our business really have to be looked at, I’d say, largely in combination with the joint venture. We really want to get a sense for how we’re doing in the marketplace. But it’s really that issue that is driving essentially the flat revenues.

Jeff Hammond
Okay, great. Thanks Craig.
Donald Bullock
Next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.
Andy Casey
Good morning everybody.
Donald Bullock
Hi.
Andy Casey
Question on the margin outlook and price cost. Does that 2019 guide embed neutral price cost? You typically do that. And I’m wondering because you probably going to have carryover pricing benefit that spills in the 2019. And you may see raw material cost decline as the year progresses?
Craig Arnold
Yes. I’d say that what we generally do build in, Andy, to exactly your point is we build in neutral. And there’s always a little bit of timing on the upside and downside depending upon what’s happen with commodity prices. And so typically speaking as commodity increase environment we tend to be a quarter or two behind it. In a deflationary environment we tend to be maybe a quarter or so or two above it, but over the period of say, a 12 month period it kind of washes out to be neutral. And that’s really what we baked into our plan.
Specifically as it relates to tariff and what we said in the Q3 earnings call was that we expect $110 million of headwind associated with tariffs. Since then the implementation had been delayed by two months. And so we think that number is now at $100 million, but our base assumption today still would assume that the tariffs -- the phase three tariffs moving from 10% to 25% go into effect and that our teams essentially go out and offset that with incremental price, but don't necessarily get a normal incremental margin on the additional tariff driven cost increases.
Andy Casey
Okay. Thank you, Craig. And then on that 4x impact, the 250 million for the year, is that heavily weighted to the first quarter?
Craig Arnold
Yes. It would be more heavily weighted towards the first quarter, just given where how currencies have performed during the course of 2018, that’s be largely true.
Andy Casey
Okay. And does that weigh out in the margin for the first quarter at all?
Craig Arnold
Yes. I’d say, not really. It really doesn't in terms of the margins itself and it really doesn't weigh on the margin. It certainly weighs on EPS for sure, but it really doesn't necessarily weigh on the margin rates.
Andy Casey
Okay. Thank you very much.
Donald Bullock
Our next question comes from Mircea Dobre with Baird.
Mircea Dobre
Hi. Good morning guys. Going back to EP, maybe try and understand your growth guidance a little bit better. I'm trying to figure out exactly how you’re thinking about getting to 4% to 5% growth. We really haven't seen order growth to that extend yet. Is this simply a factor of lighting no longer being a headwind and everything else pretty much staying the same or some other end market acceleration in there?
Richard Fearon
I think you kind of hit the nail on the head Mircea, with that one. As you think about what we talked about the course of 2018 where we've made some very specific decisions around our lighting business and walking away from business that wasn't profitable. And during the course of 2018 that business actually contracted some low to mid-single digits. And as we look forward that goes from a negative to a positive. And so that's really what's driving the big difference in the relative growth rate in our EP business.
Mircea Dobre
All right. That’s helpful. And then back on vehicle you're expecting some margin expansion there even though obviously revenues not so much, so what exactly you generating that? And as you look maybe beyond 2019 presumably this businesses going to start see some volume deterioration. How do you plan on managing that?
Craig Arnold
Yes. I’d say, one of things that we talk about is the fact that we set this joint venture up obviously with Cummins and we don't consolidate the revenue, but we obviously get half of the earnings until the JV we’ll see revenue growth, our earnings growth in 2019 and that will obviously be -- will help us with margin expansion. And then I would say, more broadly, I mean, this is just a business and a management team that just done an outstanding job over decades of very efficiently running our business. And so operational improvements, efficiency improvements, cost out is something that we do extraordinarily well as a company and even better within our vehicle business. And so, we would fully expect that this business continues to operate at very high levels of margins even in the event of economic downturn of somewhat.

Mircea Dobre
Thanks.
Donald Bullock
Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with BofA Merrill Lynch.
Andrew Obin
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.
Craig Arnold
Hi.
Andrew Obin
Just with economic cycle being so healthy and you guys executing well. How do you think about your capacity overall and North American capacity specifically, how do you deal with these high volumes?
Craig Arnold
I’d say that, it’s one of the reason, Andrew, I appreciate the question that our incremental rates as we provided our guidance in 2019 are perhaps a little bit less than what we experience in 2018, but we are having to make some investments in a lot of our businesses that are running at very high levels whether that’s Electrical Systems &Services, whether it’s in Aerospace. We made some really big investments in hydraulics during the course of 2018. And so we are having to reinvest in capacity expansion in many of our businesses that are running at very high levels. And so I think that's really the way you deal with. You spend the dollars and you make the investments and in some cases you look at your business models as well around what you invest and what you rely upon your supply base to do, but by and large we are making investments to expand our capacity.
Andrew Obin
And are you’ll be thinking your global footprint? I mean, the ratio where you investing that’s what I mean?
Craig Arnold
No. What we always try to do is really manufacturing zone of currency. And so we try to minimize the amount of goods that we ship around the world. And so what we today sell in Europe we largely make in Europe and what we today sell in Asia we largely produce in Asian. And so, from a footprint standpoint there was a lot of work that we've done over, say, the last 15 to 20 years around making sure that we have manufacturing capability and facilities in the right regions of the world. Most of that work is largely done. And so today it's really expanding where we need to in those regions of the world where we have capacity constraints.
Andrew Obin
And just a follow-up if I can. What’s your cadence in China through the year what are you expecting?
Craig Arnold
I’m sorry, your cadence around…
Andrew Obin
Oh, just cadence of revenue growth in China in 2019 through the year seasonality how you want to address it? Thank you.
Craig Arnold
Yes. I’d have to probably go, take a look at that question specifically as it relates to China. I don't have that level of detail in front of me. But I would say that in general what our belief is that the Chinese government will likely stimulate at some point we saw as you saw as well, the significant slowdown in the economy in Q4 specifically highlighted by what took place in the light vehicle markets which were down some 16%. So we believe and I think it’s largely belief that the Chinese government will stimulate at some point during the course of the year. So we do think that the second half of the year is stronger than the first half. But beyond that it’s difficult to really estimate at this point.
Andrew Obin
Thank you very much.
Donald Bullock
At this point in time we’ll have time for one last question, Rob McCarthy with Stephens.
Rob McCarthy
Thanks for fitting me in for the buzz. Can you hear me?
Craig Arnold
Yes.
Rob McCarthy
Sure. Two questions. One just on oil and gas, how do you think about your exposure there given the fact that you’ve seen the experience not only explicit oil and gas exposure but the implied bleeding of that oil and gas exposure into your industrial business. How do we think about the outer bound of that as we kind of think about your portfolio going forward and assessing the risk of what could be a continued downdraft year?
Craig Arnold
Yes. I appreciate the question Rob, especially given what I think we all experienced during the last kind of cyclically downturn in oil and gas market. And I’d say, the first thing I just remind the group that we tend to be more downstream focus and we are upstream focus. So it has a much longer cycle. We saw a little bit pull back in oil prices in the fourth quarter, but they came rebounding in December. And I would say, by and large our business performed well through Q4 and we’ve not really seen today any let’s say significant changes in our business in terms of the outlook.

The rig count actually for 2018, that actually ended up some 20% for the year when you compare the year overall. And so we think that oil and gas is always a bit of a wild card and tough to predict exactly where it’s going, but given that we’re really coming off of, let’s call it a three or four year pretty significant downdraft in oil and gas market and we’ve just got our legs underneath us that we think oil and gas holds up over next number of years. It’s difficult for say for certain, but I think our base case would be that we don’t see a significant retrenchment in capital spending round oil and gas.
Rob McCarthy
I’ll leave it there. Thanks.
Craig Arnold
Thank you.
Donald Bullock
With that, ladies and gentlemen we’re going to wrap up the call. As always we’ll be available for follow-up and questions following the call. Thank you.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call February 15, 2019  7:45 AM ET

Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. We'll begin this morning's call with a brief recap of 2018 performance, and then move on to a discussion at -- of go-forward priorities, long-term targets and the financial outlook for 2019. So let's begin with 2018, which was a very successful year.
We met or exceeded each of the financial targets we outlined at the beginning of the year. Organic revenue grew 3.7%, which was a meaningful sequential acceleration from 2017. And within the year, we saw the rate of growth accelerate from 2.5% in the first half to 4.7% in the second half. Purely North America and each one of the international divisions performed very well, and NAV made progress throughout the year with a return to organic revenue growth and improved pricing. At the same time, we continued to make investments in the business, and the solid momentum we have as we enter 2019 is a good indication that those investments are working.
Now on to priorities. As most of you know, I assumed the role of CEO in early October, and I'm pleased to report that the transition has gone very well. And I'm fortunate step into the role at such a well positioned company. PepsiCo competes in attractive, large and growing categories. We've been leading -- we have leading brands and a broad portfolio capable of evolving into new growth spaces. We have a very well-developed geographic footprint, with a stronghold positions in our largest markets and very competitive positions in a number of other rapidly growing markets. We have a suite of strong and very relevant capabilities across the value chain that we've been -- that have been built and strengthened over the years.

We have scale that allows us to run our operations very efficiently and to leverage our capability investments across a large and global business. We have highly engaged associates, a strong cohesive management team and deep talent bench. And we have a distinct winning culture that has its -- at its foundation, well embodied values and a strong sense of purpose.
These traits have enabled us to perform well in an environment characterized by highly-dynamic retail and competitive landscapes, shifting consumer habits and preferences, and volatile currencies, commodities and geopolitics. Over the past six years, organic revenue growth has averaged 3.8%. Core operating margin has expanded by 1.6 percentage points. Core constant currency earnings per share growth has averaged 9%. Core ROIC has expanded by 9.5 percentage points to 24.8%. Dividends per share have grown 9% on a compound basis. And we're returning $45 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
I've spended the past four months deeply engaged in the business, connecting with our consumers, our customers and associates, as well as spending considerable time together as a senior leadership team, having no holds barred debates with a goal of focusing on what the opportunities are to make our company even faster, stronger and better. We looked for opportunities to improve our strategies, our portfolio of businesses, the strength and breadth of our capabilities, how we organize and get work done, how we can take our execution to new heights and how we can elevate our sense of purpose.
And from this review and assessment, we emerged with a set of what I'll call observation and a very clear set of go-forward priorities. Let me begin with the observations. Fundamentally, we're a highly-focused convenient food and beverage company. We compete in very attractive, large, growing and highly complementary categories that share many common characteristics, including consumers, customers, shoppers and occasions. Our ability to leverage the scale of our business to invest in and deploy new capabilities and technologies is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, we have tremendous potential to expand consumption across multiple dimensions. We believe we can capture a greater share of consumption occasions by considering to broaden our portfolio to provide greater choice to satisfy consumers evolving taste, whether they are seeking for an indulgent treat or a more nutritious snack, hydration or a functional drink, on-the-go convenience or take-home value. And we also see the opportunity to continue to increase consumers perceived visibility of our products as an additional growth avenue.
Relatedly, we believe our product and geographic portfolios make sense. And we do not currently see the need to shed or acquire businesses in any significant way. Those businesses are not squarely on strategy, are relatively small and generate very healthy cash flows. And there is no apparent value-creating path to divest them because of tax consequences and/or transaction complexity. Let me go now into our individual businesses.
Frito-Lay in North America, our largest sector by profit, is an extremely strong businesses -- strong business that generates consistently attractive top line growth and has industry-leading margins and returns on invested capital. The core of Fritos business remains very strong and growing. Over the years, Frito has successfully adopted its portfolio to address new demand spaces, mainly in more permissible and premium snacking. We've added new brands and product lines to capitalize on those opportunities, with products like simply, SunChips, Smartfood, Off the Eaten Path and Imagine. And we expect this approach will enable Frito to continue to compete very effectively across the spectrum of the snacks category.

Furthermore, we see more runway to continue to source volume from other micro snacks occasions in what that played to Fritos strengths -- in ways that play to Frito's strength. Operationally, Frito runs extremely efficient and highly optimized supply chain and go-to-market systems. However, capacity utilization is very high on average and there are pockets where capacity is overstretched. We believe with added capacity, Frito will be even better positioned to capture new growth opportunities.
Let me move now to North America Beverages. NAB, our largest sector by revenue, is an attractive business. It has many leading brands in growing beverage categories and operates a differentiated integrated business model. We believe our operating model is a competitive advantage that provides superior customer and system alignment, speed to market and systemwide efficiency.
With that said, in a dynamic market, NAB has faced a number of challenges over the past 18 months. New entrants have come to market in some of our stronghold categories. There are opportunities to improve some of our brand marketing and consumer engagement. And there are areas where we can step up our local marketplace execution. We have good plans in place to address these opportunities. We've increased both the quality and level of A&M on key core brands, including Pepsi and Mountain Dew. We've increased our innovation to address new category entrants and to drive success in higher growth segments, with innovations like LIFEWTR, bubly, Gatorade Zero, new variants of Propel and extensions within our successful Starbucks and pure life -- Pure Leaf Tea guidance.
At the same time, we're having good success with Pepsi Zero Sugar, and this has been a key element in stabilizing the performance of our trademark Pepsi business. And we're making changes to our NAB organization structure and adding frontline resources to make us a more agile and respondent to local commercial opportunities and local competitive actions.
While there is more work to do, we're very encouraged by this steady sequential improvement we've seen in the business. We are confident that with more well-placed investments, we'll see continued improvement in any of these performance.
Let me talk a bit about international now. We have a very well developed international footprint, and our international businesses are performing very well. We have strong market positions in snacks globally and within most of our key markets. And in beverages, we have very competitive market positions, either outright or in combination with our bottling partners who provide scale and round out our beverage product portfolio.
In most of our key markets, we're the number one or number two overall food and beverage supplier. Our categories travel well. And we had success innovating and marketing in ways that make our products highly relevant at a local level. We have a very well qualified playbook to expand our business in developing and emerging markets by exploiting our global capabilities to grow penetration and frequency. A key element of the playbook is lifting and shifting our ideas from market to market, still that we continue to hold. We believe with greater focus on capability deployments, increasing the local relevance of our products and achieving greater scale, our international business, especially in D&E markets, can be a source of even greater growth and higher profitability.
Underpinning all we do is our commitment to a strong environmental, social and governance agenda. Our sense of purpose is a great inspiration to our associates and makes us a very attractive place to build a career. Furthermore, we understand that we're an integral member of the communities we operate in. We embrace the notion that we can and should make big positive impacts in our communities by leveraging our scale and deploying our capabilities to help our communities strive. We believe a strong ESG agenda is fundamental to long-term value creation. Our dedication to environmental, social and governance leadership will not waver.

So with these observations in mind, let me move on to our priorities. Our first set of priorities relates to becoming faster, specifically, accelerating our rate of organic revenue growth. And if there's one thing I'd like you to take from our discussion today is that, we view topline acceleration as the single biggest opportunity to create more shareholder value. To achieve accelerated topline growth, we intend to strengthen and broaden our product portfolio packaging formats to win locally in convenient foods and beverages. And this means growing our core businesses as we continue to evolve our product portfolio and sharpening our focus on key geographies.
Across snacks and beverages, we'll invest to capture a greater share of consumption occasions, from indulgent to functional, social to individual, value to premium, and across dayparts from morning to night. We plan to do this by continuing to grow our core brands, which include $22 billion brands, and building and/or acquiring new brands to cover new demand spaces, as we have recently done with bubly, LIFEWTR, update in Path or Bare.
Within snacks, we intend to further capitalize on the consumer trends of convenience and on-the-go in locally relevant ways. Here, we see themes of convenient mini meals, local street foods and local recipes, just a few inspirations to evolve our portfolio in very locally relevant ways. We intend to rapidly scale our beyond the bottle initiative, building on the foundations of our recent acquisition of SodaStream and our internally developed Spire, Drinkfinity and Aquafina water station platforms to offer consumers even greater variety and choice in beverage formats. From a geographic perspective, our priorities are clear: #1, invest to sustain Frito-Lay North America's growth and leadership; #2, strengthen North America Beverages to grow sustainably with the market; and third, accelerate our international expansion with a disciplined focus on right to win markets.
Across each of these initiatives, we'll deploy a simple, clear and very effective growth model that's highly focused on the consumer. That is providing the consumer 4 key benefits: variety, that is what I want; ubiquity, where I want it; desirability, from a brand I trust; and value, with the benefits or affordability that appeals to me. Our entire commercial agenda is centered on delivering these four benefits to the consumer. Our second set of priorities relates to becoming stronger. This involves becoming more capable, leaner, more agile and less bureaucratic. In doing so, we will drive down cost and that enables us to plow the savings back into the business to develop scale and sharpen core capabilities that drive even greater efficiency and effectiveness creating a virtuous cycle.
Our productivity programs will be guided by a set of universally applied principles, namely: achieving local affordability; simplifying and standardizing processes; collaborating across functions rather than optimizing within functions to achieve lowest cost end-to-end processes; relentlessly automating and merging the best of our optimized business models with the best new thinking and technologies. Just as importantly, we're also adopting a philosophy that recognizes that not all the capabilities or costs are equal, so we'll be very discriminating in where we need to pay for best-in-class or we should pay for just good enough. These principles will be applied across the entire cost structure, from labor to discretionary costs, and advertising and marketing, to fixed assets.
The savings from our productivity programs will be substantially reinvested to develop and scale a set of core capabilities that we believe are necessary to deliver the consumer benefits I mentioned earlier. These capabilities are: indispensable brand building; science and design-led innovation; point of choice excellence across all channels, whether traditional or emerging; consumer intimacy, that is leveraging technology and connecting data to deepen our relationships with consumers, moving from relationships with groups of consumers to relationships with individual consumers. This enables a number of benefits, from individually based media and marketing engagement to personalized pricing; and finally, supply chain agility, where we deploy integrated and more robust data to improve demand forecasting and automation, advance robotics and other technology to make our manufacturing assets and go-to-market systems much more flexible to satisfy that demand with greater speed, precision and efficiency.

And of course, executing this aggressive agenda of top line acceleration productivity and capability building will require fostering a high-performance culture, one that is aligned on a common set of leadership behaviors and is supported by the right incentive systems. Among the values we are emphasizing throughout the organization are being more center on the consumer, acting like owners, and moving with focus and speed. And finally, we're examining ways to refine our incentive and pay systems to encourage local empowerment and accountability, as well as even greater alignment between management, our shareholders.
And our third and final objective relates to being a better company, with -- by being purpose-led. Performance with Purpose has been a cornerstone of PepsiCo for 12 years. Its guided our strategy and has been a point of differentiation. We're very proud of the progress we've made to date and equally excited about the continued evolution of our purpose agenda. With this in mind, our organization is committing to winning with purpose, which marks a new chapter in our purpose agenda. It acknowledges PepsiCo's leadership in integrating sustainability with a strive for more than a decade and conveys our belief that sustainability can be an even greater contributor to our success in the marketplace.
Essential to our winning with purpose agenda will be a sharpened focus on advancing sustainability -- advance in sustainable agricultural practices, a holistic strategy to support the creation of a circle or plastic economy, a striving for positive water impact and continuing to make our products more permissible to consumers. As we work to execute each one of these priorities, our overarching goal is to accelerate the rate of topline growth to enable us to deliver balanced, sustainable financial performance that creates greater long-term sharehold value.
With that, now let me hand it over to Hugh to cover the financial goals in more detail.
Hugh Johnston
Great. Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. The plans Ramon just laid out are intended to create durable, attractive long-term financial performance and total shareholder returns, driven by organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, 20 to 30 basis points of average annual core operating margin expansion, high single-digit core constant currency EPS growth, growing core net returns on invested capital, and attractive free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders.
To support our free cash flow and core net ROIC goals, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation with our existing priorities intact, namely: number one, investing in the business, number two, paying a dividend; number three, tuck-in acquisitions; and number four, returning residual cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Productivity is a key component of our go-forward plans, providing both fuel for reinvestment and improving our operating margins. We're extending our productivity savings target of more than $1 billion annually through 2023. Contributing to this goal are savings we expect from restructuring actions we announced in this morning's release.
We intend to make substantial investments in the business in 2019 in A&M, manufacturing and go-to-market capacity, end-to-end supply chain transformation, and global systems harmonization and standardization. While there are investments in each category in each operating sector, in terms of emphasis, in Frito-Lay North America and our international sectors, there is relatively greater emphasis on adding manufacturing and go-to-market capacity and supply chain transformation. In the case of North America Beverages, there is relatively greater emphasis on investing to support the core brands, ramped up innovation, and adding and redirecting resources to drive enhanced local marketplace execution.

And across all the sectors, as well as at the corporate center, we're investing to drive global systems harmonization and standardization. These investments are being made with the aim of building the capabilities and implementing the processes that will support the achievement of the strategic priorities Ramon just reviewed, especially the achievement of sustained accelerated topline performance. We deeply analyze and assess each of the planned investments. We've established detailed guidepost to measure our progress and success against each one. And we're confident that the investments will return meaningful value to investors over time.
Beyond the stepped-up investments, our 2019 core earnings performance will be impacted by three other factors: first, we're lapping a number of strategic asset sale and refranchising gains and insurance recoveries net of a frontline bonus that contributed approximately $0.17 to earnings in 2018; second, we expect the core tax rate to increase to approximately 21% in 2019 from a rate of 18.8% in 2018; and third, we expect foreign exchange translation to be an approximate 2 percentage point headwind to both revenue and EPS performance in 2019.
Taking all of this together, for 2019, we expect organic revenue growth of 4% and core EPS of approximately $5.50. Importantly, we expect to see a return to high single-digit core constant currency EPS growth in 2020. For 2019, we also expect free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a step-up in CapEx to approximately $4.5 billion. Most of the increased capital spending is associated with accelerating progress on our strategic priorities. Following 2019, we expect our capital spending to moderate and to return to approximately 5% of revenue by 2022. We expect total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8 billion in 2019, comprised with dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 billion.
With that, we'll now open it up to your questions. Operator, we'll take the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian
So Ramon and Hugh, your 2019 guidance clearly implies some substantial reinvestment, both from a P&L standpoint and on the CapEx line. Just at a high level, how did the organization come to that decision under new leadership? Is this more sort of underutilized opportunities under new CEO, you're looking at, as you highlighted maybe on the Frito capacity side? Or is it more a need to reboost coffers after a tough external environment the last few years that may have pressured spend a bit? Because you do appear to be leaving 2018 with some nice momentum from a topline perspective. So just trying to better understand the decision at a high level. And then also it would be helpful if you could give us some more granular detail on which product categories or geographies that incremental spend is particularly focused on, both from P&L and CapEx standpoint. And what gives you confidence around the ROI behind that spend as you look out getting it back to that high single-digit algorithm beyond 2019?
Ramon Laguarta
Okay. Let me start. I mean the process was a, say a four month process that we've -- you know we've been together as a management team over a series of meetings, trying to define what would be the next chapter of PepsiCo. And we came to the realization that we have a good company, we can be a great company. And there is a, say an aligned vision to be a much faster growing company, because we see that our categories are very healthy in large, growing across the world. And we have been performing okay against the category, but there is further growth and further opportunities for us to grow share in those categories. And the process started with, let's see how we can refocus the discretionary funds that we have in each one of our business against the growth opportunities. So we're doing that as part of the AOP for '19. And then we came to the realization, there is even further opportunities for us to invest and grow our top line in a very competitive way and profitable way. So that's what we are. In terms of the areas of spend, you should think about we're investing across all the businesses, from our North America business to our international businesses. And we're investing in brand building, selling capacity and supply chain capacity. Those are the big areas. And also, we've been in building capabilities for the last few years, and we are going to continue to do in areas like away from home, e-commerce, some of the large channels that are driving a lot of growth for the categories.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane
So just two questions related to the investments this year. One, is there incremental -- is it $1 billion of incremental productivity also in 2019? And then second, I guess, as we look at -- there were some investments that went into the business in '18 and then some incremental investments that goes into the business in '19. So in trying to understand like how much of that goes in and stays in the business? Kind of the relative size of that? I mean back of the envelope, I was set of getting to about $500 million. So if you can give us any sense as to whether that's close to the ballpark in terms of the size of the reinvestment?
Hugh Johnston
Yes. Bryan, it's Hugh. So in terms of the size of the reinvestment, we haven't got overly specific with the numbers. But if you think about what our normal EPS is versus what we're doing this year, I would think about somewhere between 40% and 50% of it being reinvestment and then the other factors. We've mentioned the tax rate and the one-timer lapping being the other parts of it. As to the other part of your question, as you know even in late 2017 and into 2018, we did start making some reinvestments back into the business because with the tax cut and other things, we had the opportunity to do that in '18. The thing that gives us a lot of confidence and gives us a belief that the ROIs are going to be good is the money that we've invested so far, we have actually seen good payback. The reason for that is, obviously, we participate in 2 great categories, convenient foods and beverages. And when we invest money in those businesses, there's good consumer and customer response to it. So the fact that we put money into the businesses and we've seen such good response is what gives us confidence, like going forward, we should continue to do that into 2019. The one thing I do want to stress in all of this is, we started with making the internal cost structure of the company more efficient and have done everything we can do with that, and the restructuring is part of doing that. The incremental portion of it obviously is what we're talking to you about its investors, but I want to assure you while that we've worked hard to make sure PepsiCo is as efficient as it can possibly be, and we'll continue to strive to do that as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman
I know that you very specifically talked about 2020 earnings growth coming back to kind of the high single-digit range. But in the long-term guidance, you did lower the long-term operating margin target to like 20 to 30 basis points, something more like 30 to 50. So can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that view of the long-term margin in the business? Is it a change in the what's passes from a gross margin perspective? It sounds like a lot of the productivity and restructuring that you're doing should be yielding a more efficient cost structure for the long term? So I was curious why there's sort of less operating leverage in the long-term model.
Ramon Laguarta
Yes. Let me start and then Hugh can give you a few more details. If you think about the three things we're trying to do, which is become faster, stronger and better. We want to first, invest in the business and opportunities that we see ahead of us, and that's going to make us faster, and that's -- they're investments we put in the business last year. As Hugh said, we've optimized, we've seen the ROIs, and we're deploying again this year with some incremental investments. The second concept of being stronger goes to the question that you're posing here which is we're trying to look at adapting technology and data much more in our business, in the way we do business. That will drive a lot of savings that we'll be reinvesting in the new capabilities we've been talking about. We believe that will give us a competitive -- sustained competitive advantage over the long term. These are capabilities in the areas of basically consumer customer and supply chain agility. So yes, you will see a, I think, a virtuous cycle of additional savings, being both brought to the bottom line and what we think is a 0.2, 0.3 margin expansion every year, but very importantly, we want to make sure that the business gets the reinvestment required to become -- to stay as a very competitive business long-term.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
Ali Dibadj
So I have actually three questions and all under the umbrella of your philosophy, Ramon. One is that you mentioned you met with clients and consumers and employees. But it doesn't seem like you'd done a lot of meetings with shareholders in forming your observations and priorities. And just wanted to understand why. Clearly, the lot of folks on this call are your owners. Secondly, your philosophy on reinvestments, how does that apply to your philosophy on price/mix rationality, for a lack of a better term, i.e. kind of measured increases and pricing over the past few years, and beverages has taken that industry out of the penalty box for investors, so I'd love to hear your philosophy there. And lastly, your level of confidence that one year of reinvestments is enough to get back to your accelerated long-term growth algorithm 2020 and beyond.
Ramon Laguarta
Thank you, Ali. Let me start from the last one, I think it's a core, the essence of what we're trying to do. As Hugh said, we started investing in '18 back in the business. I mean the tax reduction helped us there and we saw areas where we had very high ROIs, which some area where we didn't have so much high ROIs. So we, at the beginning of this year, we went through a what I think is a pretty rigorous process of filtering investments and saying, "okay, these are areas where we need to double down." And we're adding some more resources to those areas. And it's across, what I said, branding, selling capacity, manufacturing capacity, supply chain capacity and some of the new capabilities.
But again, the essence of the model is not this one-year effort that we're trying to make with additional resources. The essence is how we're transforming the machine, the operating machine of PepsiCo with technology and data, and really looking very hard our cost structures to drive sustained savings that we'll reinvest in these new capabilities that we need for the future. That is really the essence of the model. But don't think of a one-year investment which would be a 2-year investment because '18, we already started investing. But think of this as an acceleration and then a very clear transformation of capabilities that will make the acceleration sustainable. And it's a virtuous cycle of adapting technologies, driving savings and reinvesting those savings into what we think are the things that will make us best-in-class in our industry, and it's doubling down on consumer intimacies, doubling down on innovation, doubling down in brand-building, it's multichannel go-to-market capabilities and then flexible supply chain. That's how we are -- how we see the long-term momentum.
Hugh Johnston
And Ali, the follow-up on your question on price rationality, we do think there's price rationality in the market right now. And a part of our long-term algorithm is continued price rationality in the marketplace.
Ramon Laguarta
Yes.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong
So I guess I wanted to actually ask about Frito-Lay North America, Ramon. So clearly, that business has been on a pretty solid footing. You talked about the potential opportunities to grow that business further. A lot of the growth in the last few years has come from price/mix. So I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on more specific programs to really drive consumption and volume increases in Frito-Lay. And then separately, Ramon, I think you talked about being happy with the portfolio, and not really making a big changes to your portfolio, either acquisition or divestiture. I know you guys been looking at North America beverage business from a refranchising perspective. Is that now off the table as you kind of went through the review in the last 4 months?

Ramon Laguarta
Okay. Let me start with Frito. Listen, Frito is probably one of the I would say, best consumer companies in the world, I would say, and we continue to find ways to transform ourselves, both on the portfolio and on the capabilities and infrastructure of the business. So the way we're thinking about Frito is you think our share of market is about 65% of salty, about 39% of what we call savory and only 19% of micro snacks. We see great opportunities for Frito to grow into new dayparts, into new channels, into even grow within existing channels and within existing consumer occasions. So the growth opportunities for Frito are multiple. I think the team has done a great job in keeping a very healthy core, our Doritos, Cheetos, Lay's, Raffles, Tostitos brands are growing very healthy, and build additional brands that cover new spaces, either cohorts or dayparts. So we see a very strong growth model from the brand perspective, from the channel perspective. And what we're trying to do is make sure Frito gets -- is well-funded to go after all these opportunities both from the P&L and from the CapEx point of view, because the ROIC on those investments is unbeatable. And I believe we have an amazing team that is extremely capable, proves it every day in the marketplace and is very rigorous in how they manage investments. So empowering that team with the right resources and giving them the higher vision of grow even faster and gain more share in the U.S. snack business I think is the right thing to do for the -- for PepsiCo.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira
So Ramon, best of luck as the CEO. And I just wanted to ask you about the company's long-term organic revenue growth, the target of 4% to 6%. So could you maybe help us decompose this target between your expectations for snacks and beverages globally, as well as in developed and developing markets? And just a clarification on Judy's second question I think about refranchising. Should we -- have you decide not to refranchise NAB at this time, or is it still on the table?
Ramon Laguarta
Okay. Let me address both. I mean the way you should think and there about our 4% to 6% is we have a great portfolio of geographies and categories around the world, and we see this more side of opportunities where we're investing to drive growth and be more competitive short-term and long-term and should be thinking about the overall portfolio delivering this number of between 4% to 6%. So I won't go into the details of how are going to grow in each one of these categories. You will see us as we unfold the results going forward. With regards to NAB, yes, I think, sorry I forgot to answer the question before, yes, we spent a lot of time as a management team, obviously studying NAB and the different options we have there. We love NAB business. We think it's a great business that will play a very important role in the future of PepsiCo, and we're convinced it will drive very good results for us. And we believe that the key areas of success I think for NAB going forward will be around having the very strong brands in the different spaces and cohorts.
And we think we have the brands. And we've may be may have to strengthen some of the brands or we have those brands and we'll be able to create new brands with -- as we've proven with bubly or LIFEWTR or some of our new innovations. Second will be, our ability to execute in the marketplace, both with the very large customers and also in the local up and down the street. And I think we can do that, and we are a great operating company, and we know we can do this without refranchising. Third point will be having a very flexible and cost competitive supply chain. And the third will be having the right high-performance culture in the business. All of those 4 success factors to me are not related to refranchising, plus refranchising per se will be a very complex and disruptive event for us as a company. So yes, you should assume that we're going to compete very hard in this business. We're going to invest sustainably and rationally. And we'll keep building a very strong company that I'm convinced will do great for us in the near future.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Powers
And I was hoping we could just dig a little bit further into your strategic outlook. If we think about PepsiCo in 2025, what does being the great company that you mentioned at the outset really look like? How would you describe it? And how important is it to you that you can arrive at that destination without the need for another sidestep or effective algorithm reset somewhere between? And maybe as you just talked about that future vision, just going to the prior conversation, just love some color on what you -- what role you think, the long-standing better together Power Of One strategy plays within that? It sounds like something you remain committed to. So do you think maybe can be strengthened further? But I'll just love if you could expand on that as well.
Ramon Laguarta
You should think of PepsiCo as a, I said, a company that plays in two huge large categories that globally, have a lot of tailwind. And our ability to perform on a very high competitive level in those two categories globally gives us the ability to be a top-performing investment for you guys in the consumer goods space. So I think you should be thinking about a company that has a long-term value creation model, center around accelerated growth and sustained growth, and gaining share consistently in our two large categories. That's how I would ambition. How we do it. I think we painted a picture on how we're thinking about our portfolio and how we're going to be look very holistically at the opportunities in each of our categories. And there's multiple demands, spaces, there's a lot of coffers, there's a lot of different dayparts in those categories that provide for immense opportunities for us to innovate and build brands and continue to grow.
Geographically, you should be thinking about a company that is, I would say, skewed to developed markets, Western Europe and the U.S., And obviously, long-term, we would like to be stronger in some of our developing markets, while we have strong positions to build on top, so we have strong talent, we have strong market position in some of those markets. And you should think about us growing very fast in those geographies and adding to our -- how we reach consumers around the world. Think of us, we sell 1.5 billion servings a day, so we touch conceptually 1.5 billion people around the world every day, so our ambition is to become at least a 2 -- touch at least 2 billion people every day, that's some of the aspiration we have as a management team. So you should be thinking around the vectors of how many people we serve every day and around what do we offer that people in terms of the both the convenient foods and the beverage categories.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
Caroline Levy
My question is around -- I'm just hoping you can actually elaborate on what you can do in the route to market field, just a little more detail, because if I think about the beverage business, it feels like you have some catch-up, particularly in North America. In snacks, you're already really, really good. So taking the 2 different sides, are you going to focus more on the small channels where brands are often built and nurtured? And how do you manage an online business when you're shipping heavy beverages? So just touching on that range of opportunity.
Ramon Laguarta
Yes. Listen, thanks for the question. The -- you know the value creation of a category is proportionate in the impulse part of our business. So obviously, we want to maximize our go to market where we can generate impulse occasions, we capture much more value for our -- I think we provide more value to the consumer and we capture more profit as a company. So obviously, as you think about the areas where we'll be investing money to become much more of a great -- a customer service company, we will invest against the large customers and they are critical for us to serve a lot of households. And there, I think, the opportunity to put all our categories together to serve customers like Walmart, Amazon, et cetera, is a big idea. Then in terms of the capillarity and the ubiquity of distribution of our categories, I don't think we're satisfied with NAB or we're satisfied with Frito or we're satisfied with any of our companies. There are almost unlimited numbers of point of sale for our categories. And our strategic intent is to be everywhere where there could be a location to serve a consumer to buy a snack or a beverage. And it's not only the conventional points of sale that you're thinking about. It could be endless numbers. So how do we become -- how do we make money in servicing those stores is the biggest strategic idea. We have a lot of technology to unlock this. I mean we're playing obviously across nonconventional ways to get to those points of sale, and that's core capability of the company.

Your next question comes from the line of Nick Modi [ph] of RBC.
Unidentified Analyst
Ramon, you talked about the reinvestment and you talked about frontline, putting more investment in frontline. Can you maybe help us understand in terms of kind of the percentages you're allocating or you're thinking about in terms of increases in advertising and then also the in-store execution portion in NAB? And then the second question is you also talked about perhaps adding more capacity in the Frito business. So does that mean you're going to reduce your alliance on copackers?
Ramon Laguarta
I'll just start with Frito. Yes, we -- with the growth of the business, we're stretched on some of our technologies, which impacts the service, the demand on some of our products, so we'll be investing in additional capacity in Fritos. We're actually investing, and you should see it in -- I would assume, an additional share of market gain from us in the coming years. With regards to NAB investments, obviously, I cannot give you detail. This is a very sensitive information of where we're going to invest in our SMP money, but you should think about us adding selling capacity across the U.S. for both our food service and our small format outlets.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog
All right. I certainly sensed an overall level of urgency from you based on your competition. And specifically, on NAB, you mentioned you're stepping up innovation investment to reignite growth. So I guess I've got a couple of questions. First, how much of a lag do you anticipate before you anticipate seeing improvements on your top line? And then, in general, how do you think about balancing this higher level of spending with your ability to drive profitability growth, and then more importantly, your ability to expand margins in NAB specifically, again, over the long term?
Ramon Laguarta
Yes. We've been investing in NAB now for a year or so in -- especially in our brands, but also in some of our execution capabilities. And we're seen good returns on some of those investments and not so good returns from some others. So what we're doing is, clearly, optimizing our investments against the areas where we see we're getting more overall return. The performance of the company, as you saw in our Q4 numbers, is improving, right? So we're doing -- we had a good 2.5% in Q3, we grew 2% in Q4. So we'll keep investing in the business to get to a -- to stay positive. And our ultimate ambition is to grow with the market, and the timeline we're aspiring to do that is by the end of this year. It might take us a bit longer. The way I see this is -- and this is my experience with businesses, large business that need to turn around is, you need to agree on a long-term objectives. In our case, is growing with the market and eventually growing share. And then give -- empower the team with the right resources, make them feel that you support them and give them very clear milestones to go after those -- that turnaround. That's what we're doing with NAB. The team is responding. We're having very clear process internally to monitor progress. And we feel good. We feel good and we feel fortunate to have the rest of the company portfolio to -- that we can still deliver a very good performance to the company and invest in what is going to be a very powerful business for us in the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy
So I wanted to come back to portfolio considerations with beverages and snacks. So particularly, Ramon, the ability to drive more consumption occasions, so under sort of the thinking of the two or Better Together. And it sounds like you too are of the view that the beverage and snacks do belong together. But I think there have been some questions on how successful the company has been in that pursuit of cross-selling over the years, particularly given some of the notable challenges in beverages. So do you see it that way? Is that an unfair assessment that the company has not done as well as it could possibly could in terms of cross-selling and utilizing the strength of both of these businesses. And as you're thinking about the priorities of how to reaccelerate growth in NAB, is there a greater cohesiveness with Frito that could be part of that strategy? So any comments there will be helpful.

Ramon Laguarta
Yes. Listen, I've been -- as you guys know, I've been in Europe for a few years. And there, we have this kind of what we call Power of One model in some countries, I don't know, in a lot of countries actually. And so I understand the value of where the scale makes sense and where the focus makes sense. And more or less, I mean it's not a science. It's almost an art on where does the scale give you a competitive advantage and where the scale defocuses you. And so, listen, I don't know if you guys walk around the stores for the Super Bowl. But if you see the displays we're able to build together as an organization, the amount of traffic we build for our customers because of those displays, and the combined consumption that was between our 2 categories because of those display, you would see that there is a very clear opportunity for us to dial up if that is an opportunity. Also, on the cost side, we're doing a lot of things together, right? So if you think about freight, for example, it's a great area where we're in a lot of productivity because of combined freight. And as you think about future capabilities, we're trying to build them as a combined company.
Our e-commerce capability, some of the ones I referred to this morning, the consumer intimacy, so our ability to attract talent, special talent, retain talent and challenge talent is much, much -- we have a much higher likelihood to succeed if we do it as a full PepsiCo. So we see many areas of value for Power of One, but we also see areas where Power of One could derail the performance of each one of the businesses. So you will see, yes, there are opportunities, but we have to address them very carefully and with -- and we'll try to narrow. We'll make mistakes in some areas. We'll get better in others. So that's how you should think, but yes, of course, France is a competitive advantage, and we would not be doing the best for our shareholders if we don't explore this area to the maximum.

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.
Laurent Grandet
Lots of question about NAB and Frito-Lay. I like to -- would be interesting to having your perspective on the Quaker business and the role of Quaker in PepsiCo's portfolio in the near or long-term future. Is its margin now is at a relatively high level, especially in comparison to other sales, I mean, businesses? Now it has not been growing for one and it seems like it's not really at the center of the impulse occasion, you said was the strength of PepsiCo. So really, would like to have your perspective on the Quaker business going forward.
Ramon Laguarta
Okay. Thank you, Laurent. Listen, we love our Quaker business. I think it's a -- it compliments our portfolio, and it makes us strong in a daypart that in where we're weaker otherwise. Now we need to be better at exploiting some of the opportunities of that brand internationally. So we have a very strong business in Europe and it's doing very well. Here domestically, you could think of the more we see clearly breakfast becoming an on-the-go occasion. It is -- people are rushing for to get to work early in the morning. There is a huge opportunity for us to play with Quaker in that, I would say, higher value, new consumer demand moment of breakfast on the go. You're going to see us innovating in that space. And you might -- you will see, again, another vector of Power of One as we leverage some of our go-to-market strength to deliver on the convenience on the go forward for Quaker. So I think it plays a role in our portfolio, apart from the, obviously, the cash flow it generates and the great returns we get from that business, but I would see it as part of our broader strategic opportunity of capturing demand moments where we're not very strong in right now.

Okay. I think we run out of time. So thank you all of your time and participation in this morning's call. To conclude, I'd like to leave you with just 3 key thoughts: first, our overarching objective, as you saw, is to accelerate in a sustainable way, our top line growth; secondly, we're investing to lift performance across the business, making our best businesses better and our productivity lower performing businesses stronger; and third, we expect that investments we're making would not only benefit 2019 with accelerated top line growth, but will provide a solid foundation for sustainable, attractive market place and financial performance for the years to come.
We look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year, and we thank you for the confidence you've placed in us with your investments. Thank you.

Good day. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.
Christopher Jakubik
Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update. We'll start today's call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our view on the path forward from Bernardo Hees, our CEO; and David Knopf, our CFO. After that, Paulo Basilio, President of our U.S. zone, will join us for the Q&A session.
Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation available on our website.
Lastly, as you may have seen in today's press release, we conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area with the assistance of external legal and accounting advisers and found we should have recorded $25 million in prior periods, which we booked in Q4 2018. To be clear, we do not expect this to be material to our current period or any prior period financial statements.
Now let's turn to Slide 2 and I will hand it over to Bernardo.
Bernardo Hees
Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. With the closing of one year and the start of a new one, I think it's best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally, with a scorecard, to better understand where we delivered, where we did not and why. 
At this time last year, we set plans to drive profitable sales and consumption growth by investing in deployment of new capabilities and a strong pipeline of innovation and white space initiatives. And while we expected this to translate into near-term margin pressure in United States and Rest of the World segments, we anticipated stronger net savings to deliver constant currency EBITDA growth for the year. Overall, we successfully drove profitable sales and consumption growth accelerated, but we fell short in delivering the net savings we expect.
From a commercial perspective, we firmly restarted organic growth. In United States, our second half performance came back to offset the self-inflicted losses from the first half of the year. We became one of the few within our industry posting real volume-driven growth, growing volume/mix nearly 4%.
In Canada, similar to United States, we ended the year with positive consumption growth from improvements in coffee and cheese. Our EMEA business build momentum on the back of white space gains in condiments and encouraging share trends across our U.K. base. In Rest of the World, we are gaining traction in driving real growth with the startup of our new sauces plant in Brazil, and our Cerebos acquisition in Australia and New Zealand.

In our Foodservice business, on a global basis, is approaching $4 billion in sales and gaining momentum from white space initiatives in all markets. And this leads to the second aspect of our scorecard, the significant progress we made developing and deploying strategically advanced capabilities. We had strong returns on investment in marketing, category management and e-store sales. We continue to expand in e-commerce and reach, driving 79% channel growth in United States alone, and a 1/10 market share index versus traditional retail. In this setup, springboard and Evolv Ventures as platforms to accelerate our innovation to consumers, to customers and find new ways to disrupt ourselves.
So when you think about the sustainability of our growth, breakthrough innovation, strong in-store activity, distribution gain and white space expansion are all coming together. In fact, our consumption turnaround in United States has been driven by brand-building initiatives across the portfolio, not just a few categories. We are sustaining momentum in brands where we have been successful like Heinz, Philadelphia, Oscar Mayer bacon, Classico, Kraft and our frozen and snack categories at large, all growing mid-single digits in 2018. Turning around other key brands like Kraft Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer hotdogs to name one to low single-digit growth after several years of decline. Stabilizing historically challenged brands like Kraft salad dressing, mayo and our kids single-serve beverage business after years of mid-single-digit declines. And building new brands into meaningful platforms for growth, like P3, which now $120 million platform; Devour, a $7 million brand in less than 3 years; and Just Crack an Egg at $50 million after only 12 months. While some of this was supported by incremental promotion and price investments to improve consumption and distribution trends, we saw strong LOIs and created a solid base of support and commercial momentum for 2019. 
Where we fell short in 2018 was operations. Specifically, our entire EBITDA miss was driven by net savings versus expectations within our United States supply chain. To be fair, we must first recognize that our team operate at industry-leading levels globally; in quality, with top-tier performance in the industry; in safety, with our best results ever; and in customer service, achieving industry-leading case through rates and all-time in full delivery rates as we saw volumes ramp up. 
The core cause of our shortfall in 2018 was forecasting the pace and magnitude of our savings curve in 2018, not merger-related synergies and not an increase in ZBB costs. In fact, ZBB delivered savings across all fixed-cost package outside of our commercial investments and helped to fund our initiative.
To put our performance in context, we started 2018 expecting approximately 3% growth inflation, excluding key commodity costs, with savings programs expected to offset gross inflation. We ended the year with approximately 3% inflation, net of savings, specifically driven by higher supply chain costs and low operational savings in United States. There is no question we are disappointed that profitability did not ramp up with consumption gains as anticipated. We are overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year-end. For that, we take full responsibility. And we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again by touching planning process, procedures and organization structure.
In the end, we see three takeaways from 2018: one, we are successfully driving sustainable consumption growth; two, we have the ability to deliver top-tier organic growth at industry-leading margins; and three, we need to better plan and execute our operational net savings initiatives.

Before we outline the 2019 plans, David will provide more details on our 2018 financials.
David Knopf
Thank you, Bernardo, and hello, everyone. As we show on Slide 3, while our overall performance fell short of our expectations, the year-on-year drivers are straightforward. Consumption-driven growth, negatively impacted by cost inflation, net of savings in the U.S., with tax savings offsetting lower EBITDA, higher depreciation and interest expense.
From a trend perspective, there are a few important details to highlight. On the top line, consumption-driven growth momentum continued to build through Q4. For total Kraft Heinz, Q4 volume/mix growth was 4%, with growth in every reporting segment, driven by innovation, marketing, white space and go-to-market investments and led by improved consumption in a vast majority of U.S. categories. 
Total company Q4 pricing was down 160 basis points, including 80 basis points from key commodity pass-through in the U.S. Also note that the sequential decline in pricing versus Q3 was accentuated by a deceleration in contribution from price in our Rest of World segment.
And regarding U.S. pricing trends, as Bernardo mentioned, we were happy with the returns and results on this front. To provide more context and adjust for program timing, it's useful to understand the key drivers of U.S. pricing from a second half perspective. U.S. pricing in the second half of 2018 was down 2.4 percentage points, with 1 point from passing through lower key commodity costs. So U.S. pricing, net of key commodity impacts, was down 1.4% in the second half. Out of this, 40 basis points of the decline was primarily related to defending our natural cheese business by closing price gaps to private label. The remaining 1 point was a combination of opportunistic price investments and support of our innovation pipeline to stimulate incremental consumption with good lift and solid returns. Looking forward and excluding the impact of key commodity pass-through, we do not expect pricing to be down in 2019, either in the U.S. or globally.
Moving to EBITDA. We said on our last call that we expected our EBITDA growth rate to improve beginning in Q4. While this turned out directionally accurate, Q4 constant currency adjusted EBITDA was significantly below the expectations we previously outlined. As Bernardo mentioned, this was driven by shortfalls in the United States. To be more specific, while the one-off factors we outlined in Q3, by and large, fell away as expected, anticipated savings did not materialize, particularly in our procurement area and, to a lesser extent, we had higher-than-anticipated costs in both manufacturing and logistics.
Taken together, top line trends and bottom line results lead us to the key factors we considered over the past few months in finalizing our 2019 plans outlined on Slide 4, and I'll hand it back to Bernardo to start it off.
Bernardo Hees
Now it's time for us to focus on the year ahead, what we see in front of us and how best to grow our business for the long term. Our industry has been and is likely to remain challenged on several front, continued fragmentation of consumer demand, a general lack of affordability to reinvest in brands, retail competition where assortment is likely to grow in importance and, finally, in the short term, ongoing cost inflation. 
Given our savings shortfall and the high inflation we're seeing, we could focus on maintaining or expanding margins but risk forfeiting commercial growth and market share. By slowing our pace of innovation and channel development, focusing on marketing efficiency versus incremental marketing presence and compromising talent development at a critical time, we have not and we will not.
We are choosing to focus on improving our long-term growth trajectory and returns by: driving consumption and market share; leveraging next-generation capabilities for brand and category advantage; and importantly, securing the right talent in areas critical to growth. In fact, in light of the industry backdrop, we have concluded that there is no better time for Kraft Heinz to improve our growth profile. 

And looking forward, we have set 3 objectives for 2019: first, leverage our industry-leading margins to sustain our commercial momentum; second, more actively manage our portfolio; and third, strengthen our balance sheet as we continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. I will cover our commercial growth initiatives, and David will outline our portfolio, capital restructure and financial expectations.
By far, the biggest and the best thing you can do to build the long-term value of our portfolio is to capture sustainable commercial growth by building on the sales momentum from 2018. And we have the stronger global pipeline we ever had to go after incremental consumer demand. In the United States, we'll be launching a record level of innovation, improving base consumption, velocities and leveraging brands and go-to-market investments. 
In Canada, the priority is reignite consumption in peanut butter as well as sauces and condiments. In Europe and Rest of the World markets, whitespace initiatives will focus on driving incremental sauces consumption and opening new geographies. And in Foodservice, all regions have significant opportunities to gain distribution and whitespace.
We will support these initiatives with fully funded brand programs, taking advantage of our superior media efficiency or cost per impression, and increasing our media effectiveness, our sales lift per impression by deploying new creative tools in digital marketing.
In a nutshell, we plan to go to market in 2019 with a stronger innovation pipeline than we ever had, backed by more marketing dollars while leveraging advantaged, category managed and go-to-market initiatives to win assortment and improve distribution across all channels, including e-commerce. And we plan to do this while we maintain industry-leading margins.
Now let me turn back to David as the remaining objectives are a big part of his 2019 goals.
David Knopf
I'll start with our financial expectations going forward on Slide 6. Regarding top line, we are now well positioned to continue organic net sales growth, driven by incremental consumption gains. This will reflect volume/mix growth from innovation, distribution and whitespace initiatives and pricing actions that balance cost inflation and our market share objectives.
On pricing, note that we exited 2018 at strong levels of merchandising support and distribution. And price gaps are currently in a better place, so we do not expect pricing to be a drag year-on-year for 2019 as a whole. In fact, our U.S. business recently announced list price increases that are scheduled to take effect late in Q1.
From an organic growth perspective, in the very near term, Q1 is likely to decline versus the prior year due to unfavorable trade timing and a shift in Easter-related shipments to Q2 this year from Q1 last year, trade timing in Canada, comparisons with a very strong winter soup season in the U.K. and destocking in Asia Pacific. For the year, we are targeting positive organic net sales growth, with commercial gains partially offset by price elasticity. And on a nominal basis, a combination of currency headwinds and divestitures is likely to result in a 3 to 4-percentage-point headwind to net sales.
Regarding profitability, we fully expect to maintain industry-leading margins. At the same time, we think it's prudent to begin the year by properly level-setting expectations. To do so, as a one-off for 2019, we are breaking with our established guidance practices and setting a range for expected adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion for this year. This includes: commercial gains offset by stepped-up support of marketing, innovation, e-commerce and people; another year of low to mid-single-digit percentage non-key commodity inflation, net of cost savings; as well as foreign exchange rates and the 2 divestitures already announced.

In addition, we currently expect to begin 2019 with a first quarter that is likely to see a high-teens decline in adjusted EBITDA in percentage terms. We will be up against our toughest EBITDA comparisons for the year, particularly in light of our expected net inflation curve, stepped-up commercial spending levels and with pricing not taking effect until late Q1.
Finally, at the EPS line, while we continue to believe that we can deliver top-tier growth, it will take hold from 2020 onwards. This is because in addition to our EBITDA outlook, 2019 will see approximately $0.25 of nonoperating headwinds versus 2018. This will come from a combination of several factors: $80 million of incremental depreciation expense; a roughly $120 million reduction in the other income line, mainly due to rising interest rates, increasing pension interest costs and less favorable market returns on planned assets assumed versus 2018; approximately $40 million of additional interest expense and a full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22%.
Taken together, top line, EBITDA and EPS drivers, while we expect to take a step backwards in 2019, we remain confident in delivering consistent profit growth from 2020 onwards, driven by fully leveraging our advantage brands, cost structures and capabilities.
The rest of our plan is focused on how we can take additional steps to improve our portfolio's growth trajectory, strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves against inorganic opportunities. It starts with the potential for more active portfolio management, specifically through divestitures as a way to further improve our growth and returns as well as accelerate our deleveraging. 
The recent transactions we have announced, Indian beverages and Canada Natural Cheese, provide a good template of precedent for additional actions to exit areas with no clear path to competitive advantage and sell assets with strong valuations with some earnings dilution. We have now dedicated more resources, adding experience with Carlos Piani fully focused on our portfolio management efforts. And as we're able to execute such actions, we will look to deleverage with the proceeds, which leads to our next objective, further strengthening our balance sheet.
I think it's important to first recognize that we have the capacity to drive industry-leading cash generation along with industry-leading margins and expect to hold existing working capital and CapEx levels even as we drive the growth agenda we've outlined. In addition, given the industry backdrop and opportunities in front of us, we now see even greater strategic advantage in accelerating our deleveraging towards our ongoing 3x leverage target and strengthening the term structure of our debt. To do this, we're undertaking 2 specific actions: first, we intend to dedicate the divestiture proceeds from the sale of our India beverage and Canada Natural Cheese businesses to debt reduction. We also intend to do the same with proceeds from additional divestitures we are currently considering.
Second, today, we're announcing a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share or $1.60 per year, down from a rate of $2.50 per year. This will not only provide us greater balance sheet flexibility, it will also establish a base dividend that we can grow consistent with EBITDA growth over time. And we are comfortable that this level of dividend can accommodate the 2 divestitures we have already announced as well as those we are currently considering. These initiatives will accelerate the strengthening of an already solid balance sheet with a fully funded pension plan and continue to position Kraft Heinz for industry consolidation. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bernardo to close.
Bernardo Hees

Thank you, David. Before we take your questions, I think it's useful to put our progress to date, our plans and priorities as well as our expectations beyond 2019 into context. When we put Kraft Heinz together in mid-2015, our focus through 2017 was clarity on necessary product renovation and supply chain integration, taking out costs that drops no benefit to our consumers, establishing retool and routines, and testing and learning new tools to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.
Beginning in 2018 and into 2019, we'll focus on leveraging our industry-leading margins to establish key growth pillars through innovation and whitespace expansion, accelerate the global deployment of advantage capabilities across all channels and geographies and now more actively managing our portfolio for better growth and returns. From 2020, we expect to see growth on both the top and bottom lines, as the full leverage of our advantage brands, cost structure and investments flows to the P&L.
So to summarize, we have continued to invest and focus on building our highly scalable operational model, to position ourselves for sustainable organic growth and returns and doing so at the time when the need for industry to modernize and consolidate is more evident than it was 5 or even 3 years ago.
Now we will be happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.
Andrew Lazar
I guess, I'll kick it off with you mentioned, I think, David, that you thought that there was an opportunity for greater strategic advantage, I think, were the words you used for greater divestiture activity today than previously. I was hoping to get a little more clarity on what you mean by that. Is it a matter of just simply strengthening the balance sheet because you see more opportunities for more transformational deals now than you did before? Is it that valuation opportunities on those potential assets for sale are greater than maybe what you would have expected previously? I'm trying to get a better handle on that.
Bernardo Hees
Andrew, it's Bernardo, let me take this part of the question. I think we're seeing a large [indiscernible] in the industry. And we are going through commercially a good momentum, right, with acceleration in consumption, in share gains, in volumes, right? Also true that you're coming out of the integration, we know more about the categories and the competitive advantage of each one of our brands than ever before. So with that in mind, our decision here was to execute the strategy on deleveraging faster so we can better position the company for future consolidation, right? As usual, we reward more things than we're actually doing. But as we did in the second half of last year, we did divestiture of India Beverage and the Canadian Natural Cheese business. I think the good framework for the things we're looking today, and that's exactly the point you are right now.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane
I guess, two questions, or two points, I guess, related to the, I guess, the build from -- through -- from the end of '18 through getting back to growth in 2020. One is just how much incremental investment is contemplated in your 2019 plan? So how much more are you spending in addition of -- in terms of what you stepped up in 2018? And then, second, the visibility in your business has not been very good. I think we've experienced that here in the second half. So I think it would be really helpful if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of sort of how you see a bridge to actually getting to some growth in 2020.
David Knopf
Bryan, thanks for the question. This is David. So let me step back for a second and I can break down our 2019 outlook a bit more and get a sense for our EBITDA expectations year-over-year. So overall, we expect gains from consumption growth to be in line with the stepped-up spending behind our initiatives. So really, the main drivers for the expected EBITDA decline year-over-year are a few factors: first, the net inflation that we talked about that we expect to see again in 2019; the divestitures I talked about; FX; and to a lesser extent, variable compensation. So to be more specific, if you assume the midpoint of our range or a roughly $700 million decline year-over-year, let me elaborate on the four main drivers behind that.

So first off, on the commercial side, again, we should be neutral on the bottom line as we expect the positive contribution from further consumption gains to be in line with the stepped-up investments as we accelerate the pace of our innovation, base business performance and channel development; second, beyond that, roughly half of the total EBITDA decline or roughly $300 million to $400 million is driven by continued inflation, net of cost savings, in the low to mid-single-digit range, consistent with what we saw in 2018. So this will be driven by another year of mid-single-digit growth -- low to mid-single-digit growth inflation, excluding key commodities. And given the recent experience, actions we've taken to replan the savings and pushing out the savings curve. Third, we expect the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the divestitures we've already announced, that should drive another $250 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA versus 2018. And then, finally, we have an impact from variable compensation, which is another roughly $80 million year-over-year.
So taken together, this will put us where we still have the highest margin in the industry, and we believe that is the right base to build from. So to elaborate more on why we're confident even with the miss in expectations that we saw in Q4 and the decline in EBITDA that we're seeing in 2019, let me elaborate a little bit on why we're so confident in 2020. First, on the top line, we should be very well positioned for solid organic growth globally, okay? We're already seeing real consumption-driven growth in the U.S. and globally today that we're able to create in the second half of 2018. And in 2019, we expect to further improve our consumption rate behind the largest innovation pipeline that we've ever had and more support on the core business. And we have a rapidly growing international business with significant exposure to emerging markets and whitespace opportunities to accelerate that growth globally. At EBITDA, in 2019, we are spending ahead to support an even larger innovation pipeline that I mentioned and accelerating channel development, particularly in e-commerce.
So the right spending in commercial support levels, capabilities and marketing will have been established this year in 2019. And then, on the cost side, the extraordinary inflation that we're seeing in 2018 and that we're now seeing in 2019 from things like tariffs and transportation should mitigate over time as we're starting to see in the spot markets today. And we're also confident that we will be able to -- we'll be in a much stronger position to manage those costs through pricing and our savings curve going forward in 2020. And finally, at EPS, our nonoperating below-the-line cost that I talked about should be at run rate levels, so that we can leverage the organic growth into both EBITDA and EPS growth 2020 going forward.
Bernardo Hees
Bryan, just to add to what David just said to the numbers, we're seeing a strong consumption-driven growth in our business today that we plan to accelerate. And the base we're assessing for 2019 get us to the right metrics and KPIs in all our key investments, marketing, innovation, supply chain, channels, digital. So with that base, we are very confident as we grow the business in 2019 and '20, that EPS and EBITDA grows together with that perspective.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO.
Kenneth Zaslow
I have one question. What are the key changes that will take place to change the planning and execution of the savings so we can become more -- so they can become more reliable and kind of put it into a better action? Are they going to be management changes? Is it going to be a change to the methodology? Oversight? Can you talk about that?

David Knopf
Ken, thanks for the question, this is David. So again, let me step back for a second and kind of walk through our Q4 performance versus our original expectations to provide a little more context, and then I'll hand it over to Bernardo to provide a little more color on what we're doing differently to make sure this doesn't happen. On the Q3 call, we did expect Q4 EBITDA growth to improve sequentially, as I talked about, versus the 14% year-over-year decline we saw in Q3, okay? And that assumption was based off of the fact that we expect the transitory headwinds and one-offs in Q3 that would fall away, which would effectively bring our run rate growth to more of a high single-digit decline year-over-year. And then, on top of that, we expected savings to accelerate, leading to a significant sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, in the end, the transitory one-off factors did fall away as expected, but we had 3 negative impacts in the quarter that we didn't expect: first, we had roughly a 3.5 percentage point impact of unanticipated cost headwinds, which I can explain further; second, we didn't have the anticipated savings curve that we expected to materialize in the quarter to partially offset the inflation we're seeing; and then, finally, we did have an incremental FX drag of about 1.5 percentage points in Q4 versus Q3. So given all these factors, the year-on-year decline in Q4 is much closer than Q3, and we didn't see the sequential improvement. With that, I'll hand it over to Bernardo to answer your other question.
Bernardo Hees
Ken, I think it's a very fair point, and even though we're disappointed with the miss, that's pretty much focused, like David said, in the supply chain operations in United States. We did took several actions to not allow this to happen again, right? Actions in the planning process, in organization structure and position ourselves to make sure our savings curve really match, right, the timing and the effectiveness for the year. So even though we understand the reasons of the miss, and we saw in the Q4, higher cost and more volumes coming through the pipe. And we could not offset to timing of our savings curve, we did took actions, process, planning and structure to not repeat that again.

And our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian
First, just for clarification, can you provide a bit more detail on the circumstances behind the SEC subpoena on the procurement side? It sounds like it originated externally as opposed to finding something internally. So just curious for the circumstances there. And then, on the pricing front, you mentioned increases in the U.S. by the end of Q1. Can you give us a rough idea of what percentage of your business that represents? And given we've seen the price gap move up versus private label in a lot of your key product categories in the U.S. over the last few years, do you think there might need to be a broader reset of price gaps at some point, particularly with the market share momentum we're seeing at private label?
David Knopf
This is David. Thanks for the question. So I'll answer the first part of your question and then hand it over to Paulo to U.S -- pricing in the U.S. So the company was notified by the SEC regarding an investigation into the company's procurement area. Following this, we conducted a very thorough internal investigation with the support of an independent law firm and accounting firm. And we determined that we should have recorded $25 million in prior periods, which we booked in Q4 2018. And to put into context, that compares to our overall procurement spend of over $11 billion, which excludes big 4 commodities spend. So this misstatement was not material to our current or prior year financial statements. And finally, we did implement several improvements to internal controls and took remedial measures to mitigate the likelihood that this happens again. So with that, I'll hand it over to Paulo to address pricing.

Paulo Basilio
Thanks, Dave. Let me start from the -- answering the private label question and then we move to the 2019 pricing. Why we're seeing the private label expanding and it's doing so at a more -- we are seeing this happening at a more restrained pace, around 0.2 points of share in Q4. It was a material step down from previous quarters that we're seeing. And we are seeing the most pressure in areas where low commodities, excess capacity and retail competition come together, mostly now in some subsegments of our cheese portfolio. In natural cheese, we see also the retailers have used price matching to drive traffic, and being able to invest back, that was part of our price investment we've had in the second half to narrow the price gaps. And after that, we saw branded and private label share starting to stabilize. So again, we're always monitoring the value proposition of the market and continue to innovate and differentiate our brands and products on that matter. When you think about 2019 pricing, we already have announced our pricing. We did an analysis in terms of to define the right part of the portfolio that we are pricing, being very conscious about the balance between sales and cost while still providing the best value equation and helping to drive category growth. And we are seeing, we already announced, this thing is going to take effect in Q1. And we expect overall -- our overall pricing to turn positive over the course of '19.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.
Kenneth Goldman
Bernardo, as you know, one of the bare thesis over the years on the 3G philosophy has been that, I guess, the intense cost-saving efforts will, over the long run, sort of erode brand equities. And I realize you've had a better top line lately, but one could argue, it took a $300 million spending infusion to get there. And I think, more importantly, you took a $15 billion write-down on 2 of your biggest brands, Kraft and Oscar Mayer. And to me, that literally means the brand equities there aren't what they used to be. So when investors are looking at the consistent financial disappointments at Kraft, maybe even bringing the eye into the discussion. And if they ask why -- if the 3G belt-tightening strategy goes too far and if it damages brands, is there at least some evidence starting to point to yes there? I'm just curious for your thoughts on that.
Bernardo Hees
Ken, let David talk about the impairment here that you just mentioned. Then I come back here to talk about the model that what is implicit in your question here. Thanks for that. David, can you start?
David Knopf
Thanks, Bernardo. So in terms of the impairment, the write-down was primarily reflected -- it reflected revised margin expectations and this was for really 3 businesses of ours: first, the Kraft natural cheese business; second, our Oscar Mayer cold cuts business, where we've talked about issues that we had in the first part of the year; and then, third, our Canada retail business. And really, the fundamental driver behind the reduction in expectations was driven by our second half performance, okay, which was primarily driven by supply chain issues that we had in the cost side as you know. And then, just to provide a little more context, since the merger, we've also seen significant pressure on valuations from a higher discount rate come into play, which has partially offset albeit by factions but that's really the context around the impairment. And I'll hand over to Bernardo to answer the rest of your question.
Bernardo Hees
Ken, look, we still believe strongly that our model is working and has a lot of potential for the future, right? First, let's remember, we continue to be rated with leading industry margins, right? And now, we are growing, right, at the same level as the top-tier companies within similar portfolio, right? So that's very important to put in perspective. Second, the miss we had, and we're acknowledging here properly, has been focused on operations, supply chain, United States. The commercial momentum -- consumption growth continue to accelerate rightly so. With the investments that we're doing since 2018, now 2019. We can say we have the right base to be growing, through consumption, volumes and share, at the same time, maintaining high leading margins to the industry. Into 2020, like David highlights to their alternate numbers, right, we do believe to that base, we are going to be in a very solid position to be growing top line and bottom line. Not only that, we are working more actively the portfolio. And now, with the reduction of the dividend, allows us to have more flexibility in our balance sheet to really deleverage faster and position ourselves to more consolidation in the future that we believe is necessary and will happen with that model. And so we are confident in the things we're doing, even though we acknowledge, we did have the miss in the fourth quarter, like highlighted by David.

Kenneth Goldman
Can I ask you a very quick follow-up? David and Bernardo, thank you for that, that's helpful. David, I think you mentioned that it was more of a short-term, like the last couple of quarter issue with the 2 brand and maybe discount rates have risen. The companies generally don't take write-downs because recent performance was bad and because discount rates have risen. Isn't there something broader and longer term that usually leads to these kind of impairments?
David Knopf
Yes, that's a great question and thanks for that. Just to be clear, by far and away, the majority of the impairment, which was really concentrated in these 3 businesses that I mentioned, it was, by far and away, driven by the second half performance and the new level of margin and profitability that we're talking about versus what it was before. So the margin profile and what we established in the second half was really the key driver behind the impairment.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.
David Driscoll
I just had a couple of questions, but I think they're reasonably short. Can you give us some sense of the size of the assets that you wish to sell that haven't been announced? And would it be something like on the magnitude of 5% of the revenue base? And then, I had a question about the savings programs. I think you made a statement, David, in your script that in the forecast, the savings programs had been "pushed out." So I'm a little confused as to kind of why that's happening and why can't you achieve the internal savings at the same time that you're generating the revenue performance? And then, related to that, if you didn't hit the savings that you expected in the fourth quarter, don't those savings programs show up in like the first quarter of '19 or second quarter of '19? I mean, I don't think there's -- they shouldn't disappear but it feels like, within the guidance, that they did, and I just maybe don't understand what's happened right there.
Bernardo Hees
David, it's Bernardo. Let me drive the first part of the question. We're not discussing here size or our soul. What you're saying is that we will work our portfolio to strengthen our balance sheet as we're doing the dividend to have more flexibility for future consolidation as we see it. As David said, our objective is to deleverage, right, to 3x in the middle term at a faster pace than we're doing today. With that, and the knowledge you have of the portfolio today, with our competitive advantage by brands and category, allows us to be in a very good position to understand the magnitude that what we can do or we cannot do. I don't want to elaborate more than we are doing right now. With that, David, can you open again the '18 and '19 to clarify here to David?
David Knopf
David, this is David. Thanks for the question. So on the savings side, we were overly optimistic on our ability to offset significant inflation in the quarter. And again, that drove a significant part of the miss. So this savings miss was really a combination of 2 things, under-delivery from supplier negotiations and delayed manufacturing projects. And to give you a little bit of color on what some of those projects were like, they included line optimizations, yield improvements and assumed even better performance on some of our footprint plans that we discussed previously. So because of this miss, as Bernardo said, we took significant action to address our processes, planning and structure internally and simultaneously have spent a lot of time and focus really revisiting our savings projects and we replanned. As a function of that, our savings curve is being pushed out as we implement those changes, as we revisit our savings programs going forward. So that's really what's driving the delay in the savings curve, and that's embedded in my 2019 expectations.

Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
Jason English
Your guidance for next year suggests that the majority of the synergies you realized on consolidating Heinz and Kraft will have effectively been wiped out. In that context, I'd love to hear your thought process or rationale on continuing to pursue a strategy of consolidation. Where do you see the value creation coming from? This would certainly suggest that maybe there's not as much opportunity as some of us maybe once envisioned.
David Knopf
Thanks for the question. This is David. So since the merger, EBITDA has been held back by more than $1 billion versus what we had really kind of set out for. And within that, we had nearly $0.5 billion of costs that we put back into the business, okay? These are costs that are different and independent from the cost that we took out in the integration, right? So most of the synergies and the integration savings that we captured were nonconsumer, noncommercial-related cost savings, okay? So the synergies that we realized are very much intact. The costs that we put in are squarely within different areas, and we're putting costs in that are consumer-facing and drive commercial growth, okay? So these are things like expanding our innovation pipeline, our go-to-market infrastructure in the U.S. and international, our digital and e-commerce capabilities. And while there's a significant amount of investment we put behind us, we are starting to see the returns, which is why we're growing in the second half. On top of that, we also had significant amount of FX headwinds that also affected our sales and EBITDA trajectory. And then, finally, the inflation and the inability to executing it to the saving curves as we talked about that. With that, I'll hand it over to Bernardo to address it as well.
Bernardo Hees
Jason, I actually was -- as Dave said, the investments we're doing and the things we're doing are not correlated to the savings we got to the merger. That is still here, and we are guiding more as the year goes. I actually would say the opposite. I think we are more prepared in the capabilities and we're more ready for industry consolidation to better performance in the future than we were 2, 3 or 5 years ago. To that sense, I think we're having more firepower with a better balance sheet profile is important.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.
Michael Lavery
Just wanted to understand, you mentioned your -- that you should be measured on organic growth, and that hasn't come through the way I think people might have expected. But I think there's been forgiveness around that because you are deal guys and [Technical Difficulty] about the outlook.
Christopher Jakubik
Michael, I'm sorry, you faded a bit there. We didn't quite hear the...
Michael Lavery
Deal-driven but...
Christopher Jakubik
Michael, could you repeat the question? You kind of faded there a little bit.
Michael Lavery
Yes. Sorry. No problem. You've said a couple of years ago that you should be measured on organic growth for your business, and that obviously has had some struggles. You're also known as deal guys but we haven't seen a deal yet either. Can you just help us understand why somebody should be excited about the prospects from here? Is it a deal that you know you can get done? Is it organic growth or is it a combination?
Bernardo Hees
Lavery, it's Bernardo again. Look, I think, if you see the second half performance of our commercial initiatives and returns of our investment, it's going to see a very positive scenario in that sense, right? We're having volumes, consumption and market share gains in the vast majority of our categories. Even categories that have been declining for quite some time are seeing a momentum, right? And we do know there is more to come. Not only that, even with the miss of the fourth quarter, we continue to operate at industry-leading margins, and we think the 2019 base that David just highlight is a base we can grow sales and EBITDA going forward. With the actions we're taking on dividend and the work we're doing in portfolio, it remains to be successful and we are confident we can be. We will have a balance sheet that's more flexible and more prepared for future consolidation. So in that sense, I think the commercial momentum is happening. In that sense, I think even with the miss in U.S. operations, we still have the base of the margin here that allows us from this base to build 2020 and beyond and the balance sheet flexibility for future consolidation for us to be a consolidator if the industry goes our way.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Crédit Suisse.
Robert Moskow
Bernardo, I had a question about the supply chain. It was a -- you had very poor order fill rates. I think, a year or 2 ago, you had issues in frozen potatoes, you had issues with sliced lunchmeat. And now, this year, we're having more supply chain issues. And the commentary that there's some cost savings going on in the supply chain, I'm still, I guess, uncomfortable with it because it indicates that maybe you need to try to make it more efficient. It sounds like you need a bigger investment in the supply chain. Maybe you need to expand the footprint, increase flexibility and increase capabilities. Is there going to be a big dollar investment in people and in the footprint that's necessary as part of this rebase?
Bernardo Hees
Thanks, Rob, for the question. No, actually, I think it's important to understand what did not happen in the fourth quarter was this ramp-up of the savings, right? We are in the same level as the third quarter. And actually, let me put perspective a little bit to what you said. We came into 2018 as one of the best service provider in the industry. Our own time in food tends to raise. Like we said in the original highlight is really now at top quartile worldwide. So in that sense, the whole investment in footprint, right, capacity and service is already behind us. Do we have more -- we always have things to do and improve, but to the day that you're asking, it's actually the opposite. We did believe there was more saved timing on the savings curve, and that for that, we're taking full responsibility, did not materialize, and they will come to life in 2019, '20 and beyond. But there is no bigger investment in supply chain, to your point because I'm operating better or in the same level of the third quarter, with one of the best service in United States today. With that said, let me pass over to Paulo to detail the supply chain cost here in United States.
Paulo Basilio
Rob, this is Paulo. So no, I just want to reaffirm here what Bernardo is saying that 2018 was a great year for our supply chain in terms of service. Think about the 4 pillars of supply chain: quality; safety; service; and cost. It's completely fair to say that our supply chain delivered very well 3 of the 4 pillars: quality; safety; and a great service to support the strong volume that we had in the year. In cost, we all -- throughout the year, we're not able to deliver the additional savings we're expecting, and we are not having more inflation also -- we're also expecting at the end of the year.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
Christopher Growe
I have two questions for you. A real quick one would be just to be clear on the $250 million of EBITDA pressure from divestitures. Does that include -- incorporate what's already happened or would also could happen going forward? And if I could just ask a second question in relation to a comment you make in the release about your return on investment being strong in the fourth quarter and the year. Obviously, if you measure that based on market share or even top line growth, that's a fair comment. But the degree of profit that it took to achieve that growth is quite significant and I think would really weigh on that overall calculation of that return on investment. So I just want to get a better sense of how you're measuring your return on investment as you call it and how do we think about that going forward, given the extreme cost in this quarter?
David Knopf
Chris, this is David. Thanks for the question. So I'll answer the first part and then hand it over to Paulo to address your second. So the $250 million you mentioned, approximately $70 million of that is related to the divestitures that we've made to date, okay? And then, the remaining amount is really the FX headwinds that we're seeing in some of our international markets. So this does not include any future divestitures that we're considering. It only includes the divestitures that we've executed to date, the two deals that Bernardo mentioned earlier.

Paulo Basilio
So I'm going to talk a little bit about the pricing and the return on the pricing investment that we had here. If you consider -- you think about our second half as a whole, okay, and you consider that, actually we invested 1% in price when you exclude the impact from commodity, and the 0.4% that we invested specifically to close the gaps in the natural cheese, and you see the performance in volume that we had growing almost 4%, I think it's clear to see that even though this was only -- was not the only lever of the volume improvement, you can see that we have a very strong return on this particular investment. But also it is important to say that our volume improvement was also supported with a much better service level, as we're talking, strong innovation launches, renovation and additional brand and channel support besides the high level of in-store activity and promotions that we're discussing here.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Our community continues to grow, and our business delivered good results this quarter. There are now 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger each month and more than 2 billion people who use at least one of our services every day.
On our last call, I talked about our overall strategy as we faced some important opportunities and challenges. And today, I want to give you an update and talk about our priorities for 2019. For the past couple of years, most of our focus and energy has gone into addressing some of the biggest social issues around the future of the Internet, including election integrity, content governance, safety and security, data privacy and digital well-being. And these are all complex issues but we've made real progress. In many of these areas, we believe we built the most advanced systems in the world and, in many cases, more advanced than any other company or government. And in other areas, we have clear road maps now for our work ahead.
Still, there's a lot more to do, and I expect it will take strong execution through 2019 and beyond before we get all our systems to the level that we need. But we've fundamentally changed how we run this company. We've changed how we build services to focus more on preventing harm. We've invested billions of dollars in security, which has affected our profitability. We've taken steps that reduced engagement in WhatsApp to stop misinformation and reduced viral videos in Facebook by more than 50 million hours a day to improve well-being. We've made significant progress and we're going to continue this work, but we're also going to allocate more of our energy to building new and inspiring ways to help people connect and build community.

Going into 2019, we're focused on four priorities: first, continue making progress on the major social issues facing the Internet and our company; second, build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; third, keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses, mostly small businesses, that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; then fourth, communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world. And I want to take a minute talk about each of these.
So first, continue making progress on the major social issues. The most important work here is to keep executing our road map to build systems that can proactively identify harmful content so we can act on it sooner. We just finished a year of very heavy investment to get these systems to a better place, and we've seen the results of that in recent elections, including the U.S. midterms and in our transparency reports, where we report what percent of violating content we identified proactively. We ended 2018 with more than 30,000 people working on safety and security, up from 10,000 people a couple of years ago. And this work will never be finished, but I now believe we've built some of the most advanced systems in the world for dealing with these issues.
Now however, this raises a broader set of values questions about how to use these systems. One question is about who decides what speech is acceptable and what isn't. Right now, we have a deliberative process of consulting with experts around the world. But I've increasingly come to believe that we shouldn't be making so many of these decisions about content ourselves. In November, I wrote a note about a blueprint for a system of content governance and enforcement, which includes giving people the ability to appeal our internal content decisions to an independent body, and we're currently working with experts to design the system and we plan to start piloting it this half.
Another important issue is the future of privacy and encryption. People really value the privacy that encrypted messaging brings and we've built the most secure global messaging service in the world. As people increasingly share more privately, we're working on making more of our products end-to-end encrypted by default and making more of our products ephemeral so your information doesn't stick around forever. And I'll discuss this more over the coming quarters.
Our second priority for 2019 is that as we make progress on these social issues, we also need to deliver new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives. Now, I'm not talking about the many day-to-day iterative improvements we make so that ranking gets a bit better or that things get a little faster, but I'm talking about major improvements to people's lives that whole communities recognize and say, "Wow, we're all doing something new on Facebook or on WhatsApp that we weren't doing before." The last experience like this was Stories, which continues to grow very quickly. For example, Instagram just passed 500 million daily actives on Stories. But the reality is, we've put most of our energy into security over the past 18 months, so that building new experiences wasn't the priority over that period. So this year, I think we're going to deliver several of these new experiences.
Messaging is an area that's growing the most quickly. And this year, people are going to feel these apps becoming the center of their social experience in more ways. We're going to roll out Payments on WhatsApp in some more countries. Private sharing in Groups and Stories will become more central to the experience. We're going to onboard millions of more businesses that people can interact with.

In Facebook, the way people experience groups and communities will continue to deepen. We're going to get to a point soon where people feel like Facebook is about as communities as it - is about communities as much as it's about your friends and family where almost everyone is in a group that's meaningful to them and that community is a central part of their experience. On Facebook, I also expect this to be the year where Watch becomes more mainstream. There are now 400 million people who use it every month, and people, on average, spend over 20 minutes on Watch daily. This means we're finding ways for video to grow outside of News Feed so it doesn't displace the social interactions that people primarily come to our services for.
In Instagram, one of the areas I'm most excited about this year is commerce and shopping. There's a lot of natural activity happening here. And this year, I expect us to deliver some qualitatively new experiences around that. Longer term, I remain very focused on building technology that brings people together in new ways, including through AR and VR. I'm looking forward to Oculus Quest shipping this spring. The feedback there so far has been very positive. And I've also been positively surprised that Portal has done better than I expected it to. I love using it with my own family. But we never shipped Facebook-branded hardware before and a lot of people said this would be a difficult time to start. So I'm pleased that so many people are enjoying this experience of being able to feel closer to the people they care about even when they're physically far apart.
Our third priority is to continue strong execution on our business. In the past couple of years, a lot of our business challenges have been self-imposed. The reality is that we've had a number of substantive issues that we needed to address, and the investments we made in safety, security, privacy and well-being both increased our costs and, in some cases, reduced our revenues. But as I said at the time, I believe that these investments are the right thing to do and will make our community and our business stronger over the long term. And what we've seen is that the fundamentals of the business remain strong. More than 90 million small businesses now use our products, the vast majority of them for free. And of those we surveyed, half tell us that they've been able to grow their businesses and hire more people since joining Facebook. This means they're using our services to create millions of jobs, and this is one of the most important contributions that we feel we can make to the world. And to put this in perspective, the U.S. economy added about 2.6 million jobs last year.
Our last priority is to get out there more and make the case for the role our services play in the world. Right now, there's a lot of negativity about the impact of technology, and some of it's fair and some of it's misplaced. And we, in the tech industry overall, should be scrutinized heavily because we play a role in many people's lives. My approach here is to listen to the critique first, to work on addressing our issues, figure out what we believe are the most important principles to uphold and then go engage in the debate. And I feel like we've come out of 2018 not only making real progress on important issues but having a clear sense of what we believe are the right ways to move forward. Now, we're still going to make mistakes along the way, but we now have a clearer sense of the path ahead and we're ready to work with people to understand our role and move towards good outcomes, whether that's regulation on content or data, cooperation on shared threats, working openly to make sure AI best serves people, or just standing up for the kind of open and connected world that we all want to see.

The Internet is a massive force for change and we're at the center of a lot of the debate that brings, but our core value to people and society remains the same. We offer a service free to everyone to help you stay connected with the people you care about, express what you're thinking and feeling, get help when you need it most, support the causes and ideas you believe in, start and grow businesses no matter where you are, and that makes a lot of good possible and we're committed to building technology that people can use to create positive change.
As always, thank you for being on this journey with us. And now, here is Sheryl to talk about our business.
Sheryl Sandberg
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter and a good end to the year. Q4 mobile ad revenue was $15.5 billion, increasing 36% year-over-year and contributing approximately 93% of our total ad revenue. Full year mobile ad revenue grew 45% compared to 2017. 2018 was a challenging and important year for us. As Mark said, we made significant investments in safety and security and strengthened our defenses against election interference. We gave people tools to better control their information and set a new standard for transparency and ads. We have focused on making progress in these important areas while continuing to grow our community and our business. This quarter proved that we can do both.
We know we still have a lot of hard work ahead of us. We need to continue to do better at anticipating the risks that come from connecting so many people, and we need to earn back people's trust not with words alone but with actions. Part of building trust is helping people better understand our business model. Protecting people's privacy and showing them relevant ads are not at odds. We don't sell your data and we don't tell advertisers who you are. What we do is allow advertisers to reach people interested in their products. The result is that people see more relevant ads and small businesses can reach people in ways that only big companies previously could. This business model keeps Facebook free so people all around the world can use it and levels the playing field for businesses of all sizes while protecting people's privacy.
I'm excited to announce today that we have more than 7 million active advertisers across our services. From local shops to global brands, companies all over the world are growing and hiring because they can reach their customers on our platform. The opportunities we create for businesses drive our growth, which continues to be broad-based across regions, marketer segments and verticals. During the holidays, companies used our ads to help people discover deals and find gifts. We saw particular strength among advertisers that optimized for measurable objectives, like conversions or sales. For example, Bryan Anthonys an online jewelry store based in Austin, Texas, used our campaign budget optimization to bring in new customers and sales on Black Friday. The campaign was so successful that they tripled their holiday purchases and hired additional people to help pack and ship orders for the busy season.
We're also helping advertisers keep up with shifts in how people use technology. People are creating more Stories and sending more messages, which means these are emerging areas of opportunity for marketers. Today, we're also announcing that 2 million advertisers are using Stories to reach customers across our family of apps. We're making it easier for advertisers to adopt their campaigns for Stories. In Q4, we expanded automatic placements, which converts feed ads into a format that works for Stories and delivers ads wherever they'll get the best results. Framebridge, a start-up that provides custom picture framing, recently used automatic placements to run ads across Instagram Stories, Facebook and Instagram feed. They ran short videos to show that their frames make great holiday gifts, and Instagram Stories generated over 25% of their new customer sales.

As people increasingly use messaging apps, we're helping small businesses make that shift, too. In Q4, we launched ads in Messenger Stories, which means advertisers can now easily buy Stories ads across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Beyond Stories and messaging, we have an opportunity to connect people and businesses on new services like Marketplace. We're seeing good early results at Marketplace ads. In Q4, we worked on making ads more relevant to the products that people are looking for. For example, if someone is browsing furniture in Marketplace, we'll try to show them an ad for furniture or a related item. We plan to keep working on this to provide a better experience for people and more value to advertisers over time.
As we build new ad products, we remain focused on improving the overall quality of our ads. Across all of our platforms and formats, we're investing in AI to make ads more relevant and effective. In Q4, we developed new AI ranking models to help people see ads they're more likely to be interested in. We're also using AI to identify and more quickly review ads that might violate our policies, which was particularly important during the U.S. midterm elections. Looking ahead, we see more opportunities to use AI to keep people safe on Facebook and help businesses grow.
I want to close by saying thank you to the businesses around the world who are using our tools to create jobs and growth. Last month, I went to Facebook's Community Boost in my hometown of Miami, which was the 50th stop on our tour across the U.S. in 2018, offering digital skills training to small businesses and job seekers. I met entrepreneurs like Alex Kassab. He started Morelia Gourmet Paletas with friends just two years ago. He says that 60% of his new customers learned about their ice cream from Facebook and Instagram. And because of this growth, they've expanded to 12 locations and hired more than 35 people. Last week, I was in Europe and met with SMEs from across the continent who shared similar stories of growing their companies, hiring people and investing in their communities. These stories motivate us to keep improving so more people can succeed on our platform.
I also want to thank our global team for their commitment to tackling our issues and making our products better every single day. As we come out of a challenging year and continue to face challenges ahead, I believe we're in a position to build on the progress we've made and better serve our community in 2019. I am grateful to all of you for your continued hard work and dedication.
Now, here's Dave.
David Wehner
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was a strong quarter wrapping up a good year for our business. Full year 2018 revenue grew 37% to $56 billion, and we generated over $15 billion of free cash flow. Let's begin with our community metrics. Daily active users on Facebook reached 1.52 billion, up 9% compared to 2017, led by growth in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. This number represents approximately 66% of the 2.32 billion monthly active users in Q4. MAUs grew 191 million or 9% compared to last year.
Turning to our overall family metrics. Around 2.7 billion people worldwide used one of our applications in December, and on average, over 2 billion people were active daily. This is our best estimate of our de-duplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our services. For the time being, we will continue to disclose both set of numbers. But over time, we expect family metrics will play the primary role in how we talk about our company and we will eventually phase out Facebook-only community metrics.

Turning now to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $16.9 billion, up 30% or 33% on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 '17, total revenue would have been approximately $348 million higher. Q4 total ad revenue was $16.6 billion, up 30% or 33% on a constant currency basis. In terms of regional ad revenue growth, Asia Pacific was strongest at 34%, followed by North America at 31% and Europe at 28%. Rest of World ad revenue grew 24% and was impacted by ongoing currency weakness and macroeconomic challenges. In Q4, the average price per ad decreased 2% and the number of ad impressions served on our services increased 34%. Impression growth was primarily driven by ads on Instagram, including both feed and Stories as well as Facebook mobile News Feed. The year-over-year decline in average price per ad reflects an ongoing mix shift towards product services and geographies that monetize at lower rates. Payments and other fees revenue was $274 million, up 42%. Sales of Oculus Go and the launch of Portal contributed to the revenue growth in the quarter.
Turning now to expenses. Total expenses were $9.1 billion, up over $1 billion sequentially and up 62% compared to last year. In addition to continued investment in infrastructure, safety and security and innovation, expenses were also driven by seasonal factors, including marketing efforts, notably the promotion of Portal and Oculus Go. We ended the year with over 35,500 full-time employees, a 42% increase.
Operating income was $7.8 billion, representing a 46% operating margin. Our Q4 tax rate was 14%. Net income was $6.9 billion or $2.38 per share. Full year capital expenditures for 2018 were $13.9 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office buildings. We generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow in Q4 and ended the year with approximately $41 billion in cash and investments.
In Q4, we bought back approximately $3.5 billion of our Class A common stock and completed our prior repurchase authorization. In December, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $9 billion of stock.
Turning now to the revenue outlook. In Q1, we expect our total revenue growth rate to decelerate by a mid-single-digit percentage on a constant currency basis compared to the Q4 rate. We also expect that our revenue growth rates will continue to decelerate sequentially throughout 2019 on a constant currency basis.
Turning now to the expense outlook. On a full year basis, we continue to expect 2019 total expenses will grow approximately 40% to 50% compared to 2018. Our 2019 capital expenditure outlook is unchanged at $18 billion to $20 billion, driven primarily by our continued large investment in building data centers.
Lastly, we expect that our 2019 tax rate will be a few percentage points higher than our 2018 rate. In conclusion, we are confident in our ability to continue to invest effectively in the key priorities that Mark outlined in his opening remarks: making progress on the major social issues facing the Internet, building new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives, and growing our business by supporting the many businesses that rely on our services.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak
I have two, the first one for Dave. Last quarter, you talked about an expected sequential deceleration in 4Q rather, and I think it came in a little better than expected. Could you just talk to sort of which forms of media, whether it's News Feed or Stories or Instagram, kind of came in better than you thought it originally would a few months ago and what drove the upside? And then, Mark, you talked about the Instagram commerce opportunity. Maybe just talk us through sort of 1 or 2 of the key - what you think are the most important steps you have to cross throughout 2019 to really execute on this opportunity.

David Wehner
Sure. Thanks, Brian. I'll take the first part of your question. Yes, Q4 was very strong on revenues, so we're pleased with that. On the demand front, we continued to benefit from advertisers targeting on business results. So direct response was especially strong during the holiday season. And then on the supply front, we benefited from strong Instagram growth, which was aided by both growth in impressions on Instagram feed and on Stories. But I'd reiterate that we expect that we will see a deceleration of revenue growth in Q1.
Mark Zuckerberg
I'd like to talk about - a bit about commerce. When I think about it, just from the consumer side, increasing commerce on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, I think, is one of the most exciting product opportunities that we have in all of these products and a big business opportunity as well. The big things that I think we want to make sure that we nail, in Instagram especially, are discovery. People are already doing a lot of commerce activity and are really interested in following brands, and I think making sure that, that works is - and does well is a big deal. But I think there's also a very big opportunity in basically enabling the transactions and making it so that the buying experience is good and that when you buy from someone - from a seller that you know that you can trust them, that you're going to have a good experience and in facilitating and making that go well. The work that we're going to do in Instagram also will go across the efforts in Marketplace and Facebook, the work - the rest of work that we're doing in Facebook and all the work that we're going to be doing in WhatsApp as well. So this is a big area that I'm personally very excited about and focused on.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Evercore.
Anthony DiClemente
Maybe, first, for Sheryl on Stories. Stories continues to grow very quickly. As you said, the number of advertising - advertisers using Stories are growing quickly. Can you give us a little bit more on the performance of the ads? Are you seeing improvements in conversion rates for those ads? Are the ads performance on Stories narrowing the gap with feed ads in terms of pricing or performance? And anything broadly on demand for those ad formats. And then one for Mark. I wonder if you could speak to the possibility of stitching together the messaging apps, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger. It would be great to hear what the rationale or potential commercial benefits might be to - or for potential integration of those properties.
Sheryl Sandberg
I'll take the Stories question. One of the challenges that marketers have is keeping up where consumers are. If you think about our history, people made the shift to mobile before marketers did, and I think one of the successes we've had is we made it easier for advertisers to move into a mobile environment. And just as we did that in mobile, now we're very focused on doing that in the new things that people are doing, and Stories is a big part of that, Messaging will be further out, but as important as well. So I think the fact that we've already gotten 2 million advertisers to move into Stories is because we've gotten better at making it easier. We launched our automatic placements and expanded it, which converts feed ads into a format that works for Stories and delivers the ads wherever they'll get the best results. So our goal is to make it as easy as possible for marketers to get to the format of Stories and then deliver the ads where they're going to get the best experience and the best ROI. Now right now, one of the interesting things about Stories is there's a benefit to being an early adopter. So the pricing is really attractive. And so we think the mix shift to Stories is a big opportunity for us and it's going to take time to continue to get advertisers in, but we're very happy with demand to date.

David Wehner
I would just - before we turn to Mark, I'd just layer in on the Stories front. When we look into 2019, we do expect to see a deceleration of revenue growth throughout the year. And while we have opportunities to grow impressions on Facebook and Instagram, that's less so in feed, where we already have healthy ad loads in - on both surfaces and more in Stories where we have lower CPMs. So - whereas in 2018, we benefited from strong impressions growth on Instagram in both feed and Stories. We'll be more reliant on Stories impression growth in 2019. And from a pricing perspective, there's - we've got to improve our ability to grow the number of advertisers using Stories and improve price there, but it's going to be more reliant on that in terms of revenue growth.
Mark Zuckerberg
All right. I can talk about messaging and the integration that we're thinking about, but first, we're really early in thinking through this. So there's a lot more that we need to figure out before we finalize the plans. And then, of course, this is going to be a long-term project that I think will probably be to whatever extent we end up doing it in - a 2020 thing or beyond. There are a few big reasons why I'm excited about this and think it'll be good for the user experience, which is the reason that we're doing it. I mean, part of the question was about a commercial benefit, but that really isn't the big focus here. The first reason that I'm excited about this is moving more to end-to-end encryption by default in more of our products. People really like this in WhatsApp. I think it's the direction that we should be going in with more things in the future. And I think if there's an opportunity to use the work that we've done with WhatsApp there, rather than doing it in different ways in the different messaging experiences, to have that really just - to have encryption work in a consistent way across the different things that we're doing. There are also a number of cases that we see where people tell us that they want to be able to message across the different services.
So one example is a lot of people, hundreds of millions of people, are using Marketplace on Facebook now, and a lot of people are using that in countries where WhatsApp is the primary messaging app that they use. So we have these experiences today where we're building Marketplace and you go to message someone to buy something. And the link to basically do the messaging is over Messenger, but in that country, where people really want to be using it, is WhatsApp and we need to make it so that people can communicate across the different networks and graphs that they have or be able to do that integration better in order to facilitate more transactions and connections there. Another example is there are tens of millions of people, maybe more, but I'll go with that, who, on Android, use Messenger as not only their app for Facebook messaging but also for SMS, as their SMS client. And going back to the encryption point from before, we think that there's an opportunity to, when you're going to go message someone over a phone number network, have that primarily go over WhatsApp and be end-to-end encrypted rather than go over SMS where it's unencrypted and less secure. So I can give you a few more examples like that, but I guess the way that I'm thinking about this is that there's a handful of cases that people are telling us that they want to be able to integrate and communicate more easily across the networks. I think moving more towards end-to-end encryption and improving security there is the right direction to go in. There's a lot of questions there that we need to work through. So we're working through this in a deliberative way. And I wouldn't expect anything here to launch soon, but this is definitely something that we're thinking about and that I think will improve the user experience.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Eric Sheridan
Two, if I could. One, Mark, on Facebook Watch, what do you think are some of the things you're still trying to solve for on either the content side or the consumer engagement side to drive broader adoption of Watch and turning it into sort of the mechanism for customers that you're trying to solve for over the medium to long term? I'd love to understand how you see the opportunity and the challenge that's just in front of the company. And second, there was a fair bit of noise in the advertising community about the macro environment at the end of 2018 and maybe at the beginning of 2019 with things like Brexit and the government shutdown in the U.S. Are you seeing anything on the macro front in your own business either exiting 2018 or should start in this year?
David Wehner
Yes, I can...
Mark Zuckerberg
Take that first one and then I'll...
David Wehner
Yes, I can start on the macro environment, Eric. Obviously, we delivered strong results in Q4. As we look out into 2019 further, that's - the macro economy is certainly a potential headwind and risk to the business just given the sensitivity of the advertising business to a slowdown in growth. Obviously, we believe we've got the best advertising products out there in terms of being able to deliver measurable business results to clients. And so we think that does help us in that environment, but clearly, macroeconomics stands out there as a risk on top of other issues that we face, leading to a deceleration of revenue growth in 2019.
Mark Zuckerberg
I'll talk about Watch and video. So there, we've really had this dynamic over the last 12 to 18 months where we've limited the amount of video that we've shown in order to make sure - in News Feed, to make sure that it doesn't displace interactions, social interactions that people are having. And the big thing that unlocked a lot of growth in Watch is we basically were able to move a bunch of the video-watching behavior to a different tab, where people intentionally go to the tab because they want to watch a video and browse and see what's going on. And that has allowed us to really increase the amount of video that people are watching without getting in the way of the core mission of what we do, which is helping people interact.
The two big things that we're really focused on now in Watch are, within the Watch tab, also just making sure that the consumption isn't all just passive consumption and making it so that there are more two-way interactions between viewers and the creators and that we can help build community around that, where we've built this great feature, Watch Party, that allows people to come together with their friends to watch different content and premiers. It's a new feature that allows people to basically take a video and stream it live for the first time when it comes out. So these are all things that make it so the video-watching experience isn't just about passive consumption but about interaction, and that's going to, I think, help really drive engagement as well. Then there's also the monetization side for creators, which is going to be really important for making it so that we have the content that people want to consume. And that's just a big thing that we're continuing to focus on. We think that the more money that creators can make through Watch, there will be a virtuous cycle there. And that's going to be really important for continuing to grow this as well. But right now, it looks like this is going in a good direction. It's still very early. We're still growing quickly but from a small base, but it's one of the things that I'm excited about for this year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.

Douglas Anmuth
One for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, it's been more than a year since you shifted to feeds for more friends and family and removed the passive videos, as you just talked about, and reported engagement numbers, obviously good. Are there any signs that the changes you made a year ago are now having a more positive impact on engagement in the core Facebook feed? And then, Dave, you talked 3 months ago about better aligning revenue and expenses in 2020. I was just curious if that's still your view at this point. What gives you the confidence you can do that? And what changes most from a spending perspective as you look toward 2020?
David Wehner
Yes, I can start on the expense front. We continue to have an outlook for expense growth in 2019 of 40% to 50% total expense growth. We did see headcount growth come down modestly in Q4 from Q3 to 42%. As we look out, we do expect that beyond 2018 - sorry, beyond 2019, we'll have expense growth more in line with revenue growth. But we do plan to continue to invest aggressively in the priority areas, including on the innovation side with AR/VR and AI and continuing to invest in the safety and security programs that we're undergoing. And then CapEx, we'll see continue to flow in through the P&L over time. And you already saw that pick up with the cost of revenue growth in Q4. And so we'll expect to see more of that flow through over time. So I would say, we do plan to continue to invest aggressively in the business going forward, and we are going to see, obviously, a margin impact from that in 2019.
Mark Zuckerberg
And I can talk a bit about meaningful social interactions, although I don't have any specific metrics to share on this. I mean, my own take of this, I think this has gone pretty well and has done what we had hoped, although we've made a number of changes. This is a long-term direction that we're going to continue making more ranking changes and building more products around, but I think that this is kind of reflected broadly in the numbers that you see on engagement and the growth in daily actives and how people are engaging across the family of apps. At the time, what I basically said was, that even though this might decrease time spent and we expected that it would, is we took out especially a bunch of watching of viral videos. We thought that helping people interact more was the unique thing that people come to our services for and that it would be good for the community and the business over the long term. And certainly, everything that we've seen since then suggests that, that is right.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post
Great. A couple of questions. First, pretty rough press cycle in Q4. Did you see any impact in the U.S. and Europe on engagement or usage or people closing their accounts? It certainly doesn't seem evident in MAU numbers. But just anecdotally, did you see any impact or - on that? And then maybe to Sheryl, if we look at trailing 12 month monetization in the U.S. ARPU, it's about $110. And just how do you think about that long term? If you improve targeting, is there room to grow that significantly? Obviously, Instagram's a growth platform that's contributing to that there. But just how do you think about where ARPU is and where it could be very long term?
David Wehner
Justin, I can probably take both of those. In terms of our ability to continue to grow the advertising business, it's about working to develop the best products we can to enable advertisers to achieve their end business results. Targeting is obviously very important in that. One of the things I would point out is that from a pricing perspective, there are headwinds that we might face on targeting, given the overall privacy landscape in 2019. And so I think that is another factor that presents risk in our ability to continue to grow ARPU. So I would point that out as being an issue. As well, we're seeing a mix shift towards Stories. And that is going to be something that will contribute to a deceleration of our revenue growth. So that's another factor that's leading to deceleration of revenue growth in 2019. In terms of your first question, Justin, about the impact of the press cycle, I would just - I'd probably just let the numbers stand for themselves. We saw that we are growing in all regions albeit we're sort of bouncing around in the developed markets like the U.S. and Canada. In Q4, we saw better growth in Europe because we've come off of the GDPR - the first two quarters of GDPR. So we saw a little bit of a rebound there.

Sheryl Sandberg
I'll talk a little bit about long-term growth opportunities. David is, of course, right that the mix shift and pricing continues to be an issue. But I think over the very long term, which is how you framed your question, we have a lot of opportunity. If you look at what percentage of our ads are truly relevant to the people who are seeing them, I think we've done a lot better over the last couple of years, but we have a long way to go. And that means that for every ad we show, that ad can be better, better for people, show something they're more interested in. I also think the shift we're seeing towards people doing more measurable results, and this is important to understand. It's not just what people think of as direct response advertisers. It's some of the largest brands in the world really going for the results that they're looking for. That bodes very well for our business because we think we can do that very efficiently. And then when we have new opportunities that open up like Stories, even with some pressure on pricing, we think that gives us more inventory and more opportunity and more formats, and we haven't really even gotten started on future things like messaging. So over the very long run, I think we remain very optimistic about the growth opportunities we have.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
Zachary Schwartzman
It's Zachary Schwartzman on for Mark. Mark, I have a question on data privacy as it relates to your 2019 goal of progressing major social issues. This is a topic that is important for the Internet ecosystem as a whole and not just Facebook, and it appears that regulators are struggling to come up with comprehensive reform that it's appropriate for all stakeholders involved. Facebook has invested a lot to improve data privacy, transparency and trust in the platform over the last year, but I wanted to hear your thoughts on the following. In your Facebook post at the end of 2018, you asked the question of whether we should decentralize authority through encryption or other means to put more power into the people's hands and that you plan to discuss these topics in the public domains. As the accumulation of data and micro targeting increases, so can the value of individual's data. Do you see a future where individuals are compensated for renting their data to Facebook and other tech companies? Will that be in the form of crypto through decentralized blockchains or other methods like a traffic acquisition cost? I know we're in early days and due to scalability and consumer adoption roadblocks, this isn't possible yet, but do you believe these technologies are real existential risk or perhaps even a solution to the current data privacy trust and control issues on the Internet?
Mark Zuckerberg
I mean, this is a really important question, one that we are spending a lot of time on, broadly thinking about. I do generally - I mean, I believe very strongly in trying to decentralize and put power in individual's hands. I mean, that's always been the first part of the mission of Facebook, is giving people the power to share, to connect, to come together and build communities, but give people the power has always been the primary and first thing that we have focused on. And one of the ways that we're talking about decentralization is through end-to-end encryption in messaging. I do think that there is a very broad sense, as you're saying, that - and greater awareness that having data stored for long periods of time with companies cannot only be an asset, and that it can help provide better services but can also be a liability in that there could be breaches or the data could be used in ways that weren't intended.

And I think people broadly are starting to get that more, which is why things like encryption are so attractive to people and why features around ephemerality or keeping data less permanently are becoming increasingly important. So when you think about the types of products that we're building on messaging, where encryption is going to play a huge role, sharing with your friends, where Stories, which is ephemeral, is the main thing that's growing. I mean, these are really privacy-first products, and I think that, that's kind of the most important way that we're thinking about this whole space overall. I think that this is going to become increasingly important not just from the perspective of what does the privacy policy say but how is this deeply designed into the products that we're building. I mean, these are the products that are growing the quickest and these are differentiating parts of why they work and why people prefer them as opposed to other services. In terms of regulation overall, I think that, that's going to be very important. We - the basic - the principles behind GDPR in Europe, I think we're very important, and I think having that codified around the world would be a very positive step. And I mean, we're working with folks to enable that but I think that, that would be good for people everywhere to make sure that basically every person who uses an Internet service has the same protections no matter where they live.

Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.
Lloyd Walmsley
Two if I can. First, Mark, it sounds like there's really a clear shift this year to more aggressive core product development. You talked about a lot of areas across Instagram commerce, Messaging, Payments in WhatsApp and many more. I guess, are there any that you would point out that could be a material contributor to revenue over the next 2 to 3 years and if - I guess, if there's, yes, any you would call out? And then, secondly, when you look at the Stories ad in adoption, is there any difference you're seeing between the more sophisticated advertisers and smaller advertisers either in terms of adoption or performance? And do you see any inhibitions to long-term success among smaller advertisers with the format? Or do you think they can compete effectively in the creative side?
David Wehner
Lloyd, I'll take - it's Dave. I'll take the first one in terms of material contributors to revenue. Look, I think on a lot of those fronts, it's very early. I'd say commerce broadly and e-commerce is an important vertical for our advertising business. So our success in building - continuing to build good advertising products for our e-commerce clients on the advertising side will be a more important contributor to revenue in the foreseeable future than the new area. So that's what I would focus on. I think those are still very small and we're very early in those being anything from a contribution point of view on revenue. And then I think you had a question on the Stories ad. I think Sheryl will take that.
Sheryl Sandberg
Yes, I can take that. So at 2 million advertisers in Stories, we're obviously seeing broad adoption and that means you have both. You have large advertisers and small advertisers. It's definitely the case that sometimes small advertisers or medium-sized advertisers can sometimes move the fastest. But one of the things we're most proud of, and Mark talked about it in his remarks as well, is that we take tools that were previously only available to large companies and make them available to small companies. And one of the things we've learned over the years is that the easier we make it for our advertisers, whether they're really big or really small, the more they'll adopt. So what - with the work we've done to "We'll take your pictures, we'll take your post and we'll create the story for you," we do automatic placements, I think that makes it easier. And I'll share one specific example of a medium-sized company. Cetaphil is a skin care brand. They ran video ads across IG - Instagram Stories, Instagram feed and Facebook, targeted to Canadian women aged 25 to 54, and they were measuring all the way through to sales and they saw almost a 7%, so 6.9% lift in store sales. So what we want to do is get marketers to use our tools, use the technology we have to do automatic placements, show people things they're interested in, so ads are a good experience, but really help them ring the cash registers so that they know their dollars or their pound or their euro are well spent, and that's what we're pushing to do.

Mark Zuckerberg
And I'll add one thing, which I think David has said this a couple of times, but I think it's worth emphasizing that while I'm excited about the road map that we have and it's going to be great over the long term, the growth of the business over the next year, a few quarters or the near term is going to be mostly based on the growth of Stories and the core News Feed work. And Stories is - we have a lot of work still to go there to make it - monetize at the same levels as News Feed. And I'm confident that we're going to get there, but I want to make sure that we're giving the right outlook on how we expect the near future to go.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.
Mark May
First, regarding Stories again. Given the size of the WhatsApp audience and the amount of status posts on that platform, just curious about your early learnings from testing status ads on WhatsApp and how optimistic are you that, that will become an interesting and meaningful opportunity going forward. And in terms of Stories on Facebook, from what we can gather, Stories consumption and impression volume on the core Facebook ad seems to maybe not be scaling as fast as some of it and maybe even that some of your comments last year suggested that, that in - if, in fact, that's true, do you - why do you think that, that is? And does that actually pose any sort of issue to your long-term growth plans for Stories, at least on that platform?
Sheryl Sandberg
Yes. So WhatsApp, we don't have ads in Stories. It's not available. Ads are something that's more of a future thing for WhatsApp. We remain very focused on the consumer experience there. We do have the WhatsApp Business app, which is helping businesses connect with consumers, and that's growing well but that monetization opportunity is not available.
David Wehner
Yes. And Stories on Facebook, clearly, Stories is a big success on Instagram. From an impression growth perspective, we're pleased with what we're seeing there, and we're optimistic on our ability to grow Stories on Facebook but it's much earlier on the Facebook platform. So we have to just continue to work to build that format on Facebook.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes. And just to add quickly, I mean, Stories on Facebook is growing quickly. I think we're going to get to where we need to get to there. We started a little bit later, and some of the early execution, I think, wasn't as good as it needed to be. But I think we're doing good work there now and it's growing quite quickly. So I'm confident about where we're going to be there.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.
Ross Sandler
I guess, a question on Messenger. Any learnings from the monetization efforts at Messenger? You've got inbox ads that you've done. You just mentioned Stories ads are starting to enter Messenger. So I guess, what are you seeing there? And what are you most excited about as far as monetizing Messenger? And I guess, what might be applicable at some point in the future to WhatsApp? And then, Mark, you mentioned Payments in WhatsApp. We know that you guys have been working on that for a little while in the background, but any thoughts on how that's going to play out in terms of what geographic markets that might be available? And then - and kind of what do you see as the future opportunity in Payments?
Sheryl Sandberg
Our approach to monetization anywhere is always very cautious and we are very - moving very slowly on Messenger, where we remain primarily focused on consumer growth and engagement. Our real focus has been on the organic connections between businesses and consumers, where this is a really strong channel for customer service. We now have 10 billion messages being sent between people and businesses every month. And of course, that includes automated messages as well. We continue to make progress with monetization. We're starting to roll out Stories ads, but it is very early days and we think it will be a long road ahead. It's also probably worth noting that the experiences we had to date, moving from Facebook to Instagram, were more similar, that the Instagram feed is similar to the Facebook feed in terms of what you can do with advertising. And so Messenger and messaging services, if Stories is one click different from that, that's a few clicks different than that. So we're going to have some real work to do.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird.
Colin Sebastian
Mark, you mentioned Facebook Groups as one part of the community effort. And I wonder if you could expand on how you see Groups gaining a higher profile and how that extends to other apps potentially? And then, secondly, listening to the descriptions of the convergence of features and usage across the apps, such as in Stories and messages, I wonder how we should think about how that could impact usage and engagement if people are also converging their own use into 1 or 2 apps instead of the broad suite if that's something that we should keep an eye on.
Mark Zuckerberg
All right. So for Groups, the main thing that we're focused on is making it so that connecting with communities of people that you're interested in is going to be as central to the experience as connecting with friends and family. So it's not just a feature. It's going to become more of an organizing principle for more of the activity in the app. And friends and family is always going to be really central to what we do, but we just think that there's an opportunity now to do more and to make it so that people can also be a part of these meaningful communities. Hundreds of millions of people already tell us that the groups that they're a part of on Facebook or at least a few meaningful ones are the most important part of their social experience. There's a lot of data, sociological data outside, that shows that a physical group membership in the world off the Internet has been declining for decades. So I think that building groups is - it obviously cannot replace people getting together in person, and a lot of the most successful groups are successful because they facilitate people going and doing things together in person as well. But we think that this is a real human need and a sociological need and it's an important thing that people need to do. And I think it's going to be one of the next big areas that I'm really excited about the Facebook uptick. It's worth pointing out here that while Instagram doesn't have Groups, we also really focus on community and interest there, more around discovery and hashtags and explore, being able to really delve into your interests and interact with people who are interested in the same things that you are there, even if they're not your friends. So that's going to be an increasing part of that experience too. I think there might have been another question but I - no? All right.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from BTIG.
Richard Greenfield
If I think about kind of the San Francisco Valley kind of elitist community and even, I think, a good chunk of Wall Street, there's been this kind of ongoing narrative that nobody uses core Facebook blue anymore and really, time spent is all about Instagram. Your DAU numbers obviously give a good sense that people are touching Facebook still, core Facebook on a regular basis, but we don't really get any sense of engagement with Facebook versus your other apps. Is there anything you can do to give us some color or sense? I mean, you've talked about Marketplace before on the call, but any way of getting a sense of actual usage trends and what you're seeing in terms of core Facebook versus Instagram versus the communications apps, et cetera?
David Wehner
Rich, it's Dave. Look, I think the DAU trends that we're giving really do paint the picture broadly, which is stability in the developed markets, growth for Facebook blue in the developing markets. We're not giving an update on time spent. That's not our major focus. We pivoted to focus on meaningful social interactions and we've been pleased with the results of that effort broadly, but I think that DAU trends tell the story broadly.

Operator
Your last question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
John Blackledge
For Mark, just curious if you're happy with the progress around the safety and security initiatives. And going forward, is there any kind of recurring metric or anything you can disclose to show progress that you guys might see internally but Facebook users and other constituents maybe don't see? And then just a quick one on pricing on Instagram Stories. Should we expect to see the pricing gap close between feed and Stories over the course of 2019?
David Wehner
John, I can real quickly take the pricing question first. The reality is pricing is a function of supply and demand and how demand grows versus supply. So while I do expect that we'll bring more advertisers to Stories and we'll bring more advertising formats to Stories and that will create more demand for Stories, we're also growing Stories inventory quickly. So those two things will balance out in price. Feed from a growth perspective on an impression front is more constrained given where we are with ad loads on Facebook and Instagram. So there'll be more pricing pressure there because there's already strong demand for feed products. So in terms of convergence, it's hard to say how those things will play out. We do think there's opportunities to improve the value of the Stories format that will translate into better price for Stories. But how it converges over time, there's a lot of different dynamics there.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes. And on all the content and safety and security issues, there's more to do here but I'm proud of the work that we've done to get in front of a lot more of these issues. If you think about the journey that the company has really been on for the last couple of years, it's moving from reactively dealing with issues that our community flags. Perhaps if someone sees some content that's problematic, they used to tell us about it and then we'd go look at it to now, increasingly, we're building AI systems and we have tens of thousands of people who are doing more proactive review of content that could be potentially problematic. And we're prioritizing the different types of content that we think could create the most harm. So one of the things that we worked on earliest was removing terrorist propaganda. One of the things that we're proud of there is, there are now 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda content that we take down, our AI flags it, removes it before people see it. Another area that we really care about that's deeply important is self-harm, right? And that's an area where the goal isn't to take down the content, but if we see an area where - if we see something that a person might be thinking about hurting themselves, we now have thousands of people and technical tools that can flag this content to those people to - so we can actually go get first responders to go reach out to people.
And I think in the last six months or a year alone, there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of cases where we're we've been able to get first responders to people when they needed help because of this approach of being more proactive on looking at the content. The same goes for things around election interference and more proactively looking for inauthentic behavior. And we've taken down a lot of effort by different nation states to harm or interfere in elections that way. So we're just going to go down the list of every basic type of bad content. And we do report this publicly, going back to your question. We issue a transparency report. It's our content enforcement report. Right now, we're doing it, I think it's every six months, but the goal is to get that to the cadence by, I think it's the end of this year, we're going to be doing it quarterly and doing calls to discuss the results just like we do for earnings because we think that this stuff is really important as well, at the same level there.

So where I come to summarize where I think we are, coming into 2019 is, 2017 and 2018 were really - we had a lot of hard work to do, but we also needed to figure out what the road map was going to be going forward. And while we haven't solved all of the issues yet - you never solve all of the issues, but we certainly have a lot more to do on our road map. The way that I feel starting 2019 is that we have clear road maps for what we need to go do. And I think you're going to be able to look at these transparency reports as we issue them and see that we're continually making more progress, finding more of the content proactively, taking - getting better at taking it down, getting better at not distributing stuff that's borderline. And that's just some of the most important work that we're doing. It's also the first priority again for this year, is making - continuing to make progress on the big, substantive issues facing the Internet and our company because there's still a lot more to do here, and this is incredibly important. But I do feel like we've started to turn a corner and have a clear plan for what we need to do here now. So thanks for that question.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's President (sic) [Chairman] and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steve Sanghi. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you. I'd like to turn the call to Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer, first. Eric, go ahead.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Okay. Good morning, everybody.
During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO, and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and make some specific comments on the pending acquisition of Microsemi. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were just over $1 billion, above the high end of our guidance and up 0.8% sequentially from net sales of $994.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the high end of our guidance at 61.7%, which is a new record level for Microchip. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 22.2% of sales, and non-GAAP operating income was a record 39.5%. Non-GAAP net income was a record $351.3 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.40, which was above the high end of our guidance of $1.37. Non-GAAP EPS in the March 2018 quarter was up 20.7% compared to the March quarter of 2017.
For fiscal year 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $3.981 billion and up 13.7% year over year. Gross margins were 61.1%. Operating expenses were 22.4% of sales, and operating income was 38.7% of sales. Net income was $1.356 billion, and non-GAAP EPS was $5.45 per diluted share.

On a GAAP basis, gross margins in the March 2018 quarter, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 61.4%. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.3 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $371 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $122.8 million, share-based compensation of $20 million, $5.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $0.2 million.
GAAP net income in the quarter was $146.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share, and was impacted by a couple of discrete events in the quarter. GAAP net income was impacted by a $15.5 million charge associated with marking our investments to market through the P&L. These investments used to be held to maturity, but since the investments will be liquidated to fund the acquisition of Microsemi, the unrealized loss that would have been recorded in other comprehensive income in the absence of the anticipated acquisition was recognized in earnings. GAAP net income was also impacted by $38.9 million of discrete tax expense during the quarter, primarily associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
For fiscal year 2018, net sales were a record $3.98 billion. Gross margins were 60.8%. Operating expenses were 37.3% of sales, and operating income was 23.5% of sales. Net income of $255.4 million was $1.03 per diluted share.
The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.4% in the March quarter. As we have continued to evaluate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are now expecting about $327 million of taxes to be paid over the eight years related to the tax incurred on foreign earnings that were permanently invested offshore, referred to as the transition tax. This estimate is up modestly from what we had discussed with investors last quarter. We estimate the tax payments to be approximately $26 million in years one through five, $49 million in year six, $65 million in year seven, and $82 million in year eight. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and these estimates may change as we complete our full analysis.
As we look forward, excluding the transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we expect our ongoing long-term cash tax rate to be between 8% and 9%, which is what we are providing to investors for cash flow and non-GAAP operating model forecasting purposes.
Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at March 31, 2018 was $476.2 million. Microchip had 112 days of inventory at March 31, 2018, down three days from the end of the December quarter. Inventory at our distributors was at 36 days and up two days from the December quarter.
The cash flow from operating activities was $359.6 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.197 billion, of which over $700 million is domestic cash. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the majority of our offshore cash can be brought back to the U.S. without incurring any material additional tax cost.
Our EBITDA in the March 2018 quarter was a record $429.6 million. Our net leverage excluding our 2037 convertible debentures was 0.95 times at March 31, 2018, positioning us well for the Microsemi acquisition.
Capital expenditures were $58.4 million in the March 2018 quarter and $206.8 million for fiscal year 2018. In April, we completed a purchase of a building in San Jose for $40.8 million, which we had previously leased. This purchase will reduce our ongoing operating expenses. Excluding this building purchase, we expect about $30 million to $50 million in capital spending in the June quarter. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 to be between $200 million and $250 million, of which $70 million represents the San Jose building purchase and three other buildings being constructed, which we have discussed with you before.

We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvement to our business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.
Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $32.8 million.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone.
We performed better than we expected in the seasonally slower March quarter, with a sequential revenue growth of 0.8%. March quarter 2018 revenue over March quarter 2017 revenue grew 11%, all organic growth, as there was no contribution from acquisitions in the last four quarters.
On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 revenue grew a strong 13.7% over fiscal year 2017. The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make good progress, especially in terms of new design opportunities, as we enable our clients' innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions.
Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our Microcontroller business has performed well for a March quarter, with revenue down sequentially only 0.6% as compared to the December quarter. March quarter 2018 revenue was up a very strong 13.2% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 Microcontroller revenue at $2.6 billion was an all-time record and grew a strong 17.5% over fiscal year 2017. Microcontrollers represented 65.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
Last month, Gartner Dataquest released their microcontroller market share report for calendar 2017. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the number one position for 8-bit microcontrollers. We were the fastest-growing 8-bit microcontroller franchise and gained substantial market share in calendar 2017, as we grew much faster than the 8-bit microcontroller market, so much so we are now approximately 60% larger than the number two 8-bit microcontroller player.
In the 16-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the number five position but continued to gain significant market share, as we grew much faster than the 16-bit microcontroller market, and we're the fastest-growing franchise. In the 32-bit microcontroller market, we remained in the number six position but also gained significant market share, as we grew much faster than the 32-bit microcontroller market, and we're the fastest-growing franchise here too.
For microcontrollers overall, we remained in the number three position. We're the fastest-growing franchise and grew at almost 2.5 times the microcontroller market, as we continued our relentless march towards the number one spot.
Our microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger, and we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share in 2018, as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Now moving to our analog business, our analog revenue was sequentially up 4.7% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter, setting a new record in the process. March quarter 2018 analog revenue grew 5.1% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 analog revenue at $952 million was an all-time record and grew 6% over fiscal year 2017. Analog represented 24.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.

As we have highlighted in investor communications over the last few quarters, our publicly reported analog results will see some revenue classification headwinds resulting from a deliberate shift in strategy we made several quarters ago. The change in product line strategy is that we have for some time been adding microcontroller cores to several of our more complex analog products, especially those that provide our clients with smart connectivity solutions.
The addition of microcontroller cores to these analog products enables us to sell a higher-value and more defensible total system solution. These smart connectivity products are growing nicely. And as they replace older products in new designs, our revenue classification for these products has shifted from analog product lines to our microcontroller product line.
Transitioning to more sticky and higher-margin smart connectivity revenue is the right Microchip answer, but does impact some of the product line reporting that analysts are interested in, as some of the revenue growth shifts into our microcontroller product line. In the longer term, as the revenue from the analog attach design wins continue to ramp, we fully expect that the analog product line revenue will outgrow this revenue classification headwind.
Moving next to our licensing business, this business was seasonally down 4% sequentially in the March quarter, although March quarter 2018 revenue grew 14.6% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 licensing business at $104.8 million was an all-time record and grew 14.9% over fiscal year 2017. We are seeing the fruits of having licensed many foundries and independent device makers for several years on multiple process technology nodes, manifested in our results as the licensed processes ramp volume and generate royalty revenue for many years to come.
Finally, our memory business was sequentially up 3.8% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter, and March quarter 2018 grew 9.9% over March quarter 2017. On a fiscal year basis, fiscal year 2018 memory revenue at $199.7 million grew 7.2% over fiscal year 2017.
Now a quick update about Microsemi and our progress since our March 1 announcement, integration planning meetings and discussions are occurring between the business units, sales, manufacturing, and support groups of both companies. Teams at both companies started to identify product cross-selling opportunities that we can pursue after the close and have also identified reference designs that can take advantage of a combined total system approach.
We're also determining how our product line reporting will be done post the close, and we'll have an update for you no later than the next earnings call. Steve will cover the status of regulatory and other approvals in his section.
So now let me pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you, Ganesh, and good morning for you, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 and fiscal year 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2019.
Our March quarter financial results were excellent. Our net sales were up 0.8% sequentially and up 11% from the year-ago quarter and were above the high end of our revised guidance. The sales in our Atmel-originated business was down, consistent with Atmel seasonality. Our core Microchip business was very strong and up significantly sequentially.
Our non-GAAP gross margin of 61.7% of sales was a record and at the high end of our guidance. Operating profit of 39.5% of sales was better than the high end of our guidance and made a new all-time record. And earnings per share of $1.40 was $0.055 better than the midpoint of our revised guidance.

Reflecting on the fiscal year 2018 results, it was clearly the best year in the history of Microchip, in which we made many new records. Fiscal year 2018 net sales were up 13.7% from fiscal year 2017, and it was all organic growth. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering an outstanding quarter and fiscal year 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 110th consecutive profitable quarter.
Now, I will provide you with an update on Microchip 2.0. We are continuing to experience an enormous customer preference to design with our microcontroller solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit customer applications. Our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line, through which we are able to provide total system solutions to our customers. We are winning incremental design wins with multiple products in the same boards of our customers.
At our Analyst and Investor Day on March 1, 2018, we showed that the number of Microchip parts per customer system was growing at a 20% annual rate. With another quarter under our belt, the number of parts per system is continuing this trend of being up 20% over the same quarter a year ago. We have a robust design win funnel, and we feel very optimistic that Microchip 2.0 is working. We also recently received SIA [Semiconductor Industry Association] numbers for quarter ending March 31, 2018. Based on SIA numbers, our microcontroller market share grew in each of 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit product lines in the March 2018 quarter versus the year-ago quarter.
Our inventories at Microchip at the end of March 2018 were 112 days, which is just slightly below our target of 115 to 120 days. We continue to make enormous progress on the manufacturing side and bringing capacity online and decreasing lead times. In the last conference call, we stated our lead times to be between 4 to 14 weeks. Our lead times now are between 4 to 10 weeks. Normal lead times would be between 4 to 8 weeks.
Our book-to-bill ratio for the March quarter was extremely healthy and around the number we had given you at the Analyst Day, and our backlog has grown even higher to another record. With healthy book-to-bill ratio continuing, now will be the time to start providing quarterly numbers for book-to-bill ratio, as we had said in the Analyst Day. We have always said that book-to-bill ratio is confusing and simply tracks the lead times. We have proven it again with book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 in the December quarter. The business remained healthy in March quarter. Providing book-to-bill ratio simply increases volatility in the stock. In the March quarter, we successfully soft-landed the business, consistent with the guidance we have been providing, and we will continue to grow in the June quarter.
During the quarter ending June 30, 2018, we will adopt a new GAAP revenue recognition standard, which will result in recognition of revenue at the time products are sold to distributors, whereas currently revenue on such transactions are deferred until the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer. We are not able to provide guidance on a GAAP basis, as we are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease in relation to end-market demand, and this is not how we manage our business.
As evidence of this uncertainty, in recent years we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter. Our non-GAAP revenue will be based on true end-market demand, so we will report a non-GAAP revenue which will be based on true end-market demand in which we measure the revenue based on when the product is sold by our distributors to an end customer, meaning we will continue to report a non-GAAP revenue based on sell-through.

We will continue to manage our business and distributor relationships based on such sell-through revenue recognition. All of Microchip's bonus programs will continue to work based on sell-through revenue recognition. Therefore, along with GAAP results, which will be based on sell-in, we will also report our non-GAAP results based on sell-through revenue recognition.
In terms of guidance, we will only provide guidance based on non-GAAP revenue, so we expect total non-GAAP net revenue for the June quarter to be up 1% to 6% sequentially, giving us a midpoint of the guidance at 3.5%. Given the amount of revenue beat in March quarter, this guidance is modestly better than the expectation we had provided during the Analyst Day.
Regarding gross margin, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers. We expect gross margin for the June quarter to be between 61.6% and 62% of sales. We expect our overall operating expenses to be between 22% and 22.4% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 39.2% and 40% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.39 and $1.49 per share. All these numbers do not include Microsemi.
Now I wanted to make a couple of comments on the pending acquisition of Microsemi. On April 12, 2018, we received U.S. antitrust clearance. On April 19, 2018, China's MOFCOM accepted Microchip's filing for review under Simplified Procedure. We cannot confirm yesterday's report in the press that China's MOFCOM has cleared the transaction. We believe that the review process is running smoothly, and we remain optimistic that we will receive clearance shortly. In addition, yesterday, on May 7, we did receive Japan's antitrust clearance.
We expect several other countries to clear the antitrust review this month. The Microsemi shareholder vote is scheduled for May 22, 2018, and we believe that we are on schedule for closing the acquisition sometime during early June 2018.
I want to remind investors that during our Analyst and Investor Day presentations, we increased our long-term financial model with the Microsemi acquisition to a non-GAAP gross margin of 63%, operating expense of 22.5%, and an operating profit of 40.5%.
As you all know, we will be borrowing about $8 billion to close the Microsemi transaction. I want to assure you that after the closure of Microsemi acquisition, we plan to use all of our cash generation, after dividend and capital, of course, to rapidly delever the balance sheet until the leverage comes down to about 2.5x, which is our long-term target.
In addition, given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimate to First Call.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?

Thank you. We will take our first question from William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great, thanks so much for taking my question. You highlighted earlier in your prepared remarks that you've added capacity, I think, as it related to the Atmel products to reduce the lead times there. I'm wondering if you can talk about your anticipation for lead times as we go forward. Do you expect that to get in the normal range in the current quarter?
And I'd also like to know as it relates to your raw materials and lead time from foundries, whether you see that as already within the normal range or if it's extended. And if there's anything remarkable about that, I'd love to hear details. Thank you very much.

Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So thank you, Will. The normal lead times are 4 to 8 weeks usually on 85% – 90% of the products. That's what we call a normal lead time. There will always be some strange products or specialized projects that need extra work or extreme circumstances where the lead time would be longer. So for a majority of the products, 4 to 8 weeks lead time is normal. We are currently at 4 to 10 weeks, so we've got a little more progress to make. And as we have been saying for about a year or longer is that we expect the lead times to essentially become normal by the end of June, and we are really on schedule for that.
The other part of your question was lead times at suppliers and foundries and all that. Scattered issues here and there, but in general, the foundry lead times are normal. We're able to get the capacity we need from our foundries. We're able to get the assembly/test equipment that we're acquiring. Again, the lead time could be 2 to 4 weeks longer to get some of the test equipment, but it also largely depends on what you're buying and what the mix of equipment is, what you're trying to buy, and what particular setup you need. But lead times are really not excessive either on foundry wafers or on assembly and test equipment.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Helpful, thanks so much and congrats on the good results and outlook.

Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes, thank you. Steve, any update on industry pricing, be it from some of the consolidation, some of the favorable impact there, also relative to just the tight conditions today and how that might be influencing pricing?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Type of what?
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
The pricing environment today, just if you can, talk about just how the consolidation in the industry is influencing that as well as just the tight industry conditions.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Okay, tight industry conditions. So the pricing is very normal. We've been saying for quite a while that the historic industry practice where the prices went down every year, we are really no longer following that trend. We have seen some others follow it. We are winning a lot more often at customers not giving them year-to-year price reduction. Five years ago, we'll succeed some of the times; today we succeed most of the time. So industry pricing for us really looks very normal.
We did some price increases in the last two years. I think that's largely behind us. Now prices are stable but they're not going down. Meanwhile, we are continuing to improve cost on a lot of products by bringing assembly/test inside with the die shrinks and others. And in those cases, some of those are improving the gross margin as you're seeing it.
Now in terms of tight industry conditions, they're obviously helping pricing. The consolidation is also helping prices, but where the industry conditions are tightest are really not on microcontroller, analog, and Wi-Fi and other products we make. Industry conditions are the tightest on passives. There could be 40 – 50 weeks lead time to really get capacitors and products like that, and I think that's where we are seeing price increases. We don't sell those devices. We don't compete with them, but we buy some of those devices for our development tool and all that. It's not a very high-cost component for us because development tool is a very small business, but we are seeing long lead times and tight supply especially on passives.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it, thanks for sharing that. And then just a follow-up for Ganesh on the Microchip 2.0 cross-selling, and any additional milestones you can share with us on the progress you're making?

Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
All our internal indicators look good. As Steve mentioned, attach is one of those things we are continuing to measure how that is growing quarter over quarter and year over year. It's a long-term process, but we're sowing lots of seeds and taking care of those seeds to make sure that they bloom, and we're very confident that it will continue to grow and provide growth for us as an incremental growth driver.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it, thanks.

Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I realize Microchip's own inventory came down and is a little bit below your target range. I was hoping you could extend that discussion a bit further and talk about where you think inventory is in the channel and any changes you expect distributors to be making with their inventory.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
The inventory was a little lower than our expectation because sales were higher than our expectation. Our guidance at the midpoint was minus 1% sequentially. And based on that, inventory would be slightly higher and in the range of 115 days to 120 days. Instead, we reported sales which were up 0.8%, so 1.8% beat. Its net result was the inventory days were slightly lower.
I think inventory is fine. Two, three days don't really make that kind of difference. We're comfortable with the inventory position. Inventory, there are always products which are showed and the product was a little high. So there's a continuous effort constantly to get the inventory in the perfect mix. And there's no such thing as perfect, but our inventory is in good shape.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And there was a lot of discussion in the last earnings call and at the Analyst Day about what new seasonality for the company is. I was hoping you could help us better contextualize how you think about guidance for this coming quarter of up 1% to 6% sequentially. How does that compare to what that new seasonality may be? And are there any headwinds or tailwinds relative to normal seasonality that you're trying to factor into your guidance for this coming quarter?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So I think at the Analyst Day, we said June quarter was 5%, if you recall, sequentially, but we beat the March quarter by 1.8%. So when you put it all together, at the 3.5%, we're slightly better than that guidance. We did better in manufacturing last quarter in shipping some delinquency that originally we thought we were going to ship it in the June quarter, but we were able to do better and were able to ship some more in the March quarter, which resulted beating the March quarter, and then a little bit of the product went from June into March.
We're facing a lot of one-time issues. There is a slight impact because of ZTE. We can't ship to ZTE. There are long lead times on passive that we talked about, so certain customers are telling us that they don't need our product because they cannot get passives to complete their boards and systems.
China. That has been lowered from 17% to 16%. It doesn't sound much, sounds trivial, but a number of customers asked us to delay shipment from April into May because the lower VAT was effective on May 1. So that pushed some shipments from April into May, but that's kind of a wash for the quarter. But you never know whether they didn't do some production in April and whether there will be any net result for the quarter, hopefully not. The overall trade tensions, we're not seeing any impact of that, but if anything else crazy happens, then you have to account for that.

None of those items I talked about really are significant. They're all 0.1% – 0.2% issues sequentially, but you add all four or five of them and it could be in a 0.5% to 1% probably impact driven by many of these factors together. I think what we guided June quarter is really seasonal, especially if March quarter was minus 1% and the June quarter would have been totally seasonal. So we don't have years of experience with Atmel and the numbers for that seasonality, but what we're guiding seems to be close to seasonal.
The other point is this is all going to change again when the Microsemi deal closes in June. And all the rest of the quarters again, we don't have experience on seasonality. And then when we come to the next March and next June, we're going to have to go through same learning process again. And we barely finished the learning process on Atmel, so that is the challenge of growth through acquisitions.

We will take our next question...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Did that answer your question?
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks so much.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on the nice execution. Steve, I wanted to start with two clarifications. One, if you could, provide any color for us on whether this round of approvals, especially through MOFCOM, is different than what you've seen in the past.
And secondly, I thought I heard the statement that the company is expected to borrow about $8 billion related to the upcoming Microsemi transaction, but I thought on the initial announcement it was $8.6 billion. So has there been a modest reduction in the expected debt that's undertaken to complete that transaction?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So answering your second part of your question first, the number that we had stated was really going off the December numbers. And from December to June, we are substantially a cash generating entity, so we have generated $0.5 billion-plus of cash in that time, and so has Microsemi. So there's a portion reduction coming from there. I think that's the only change. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
No, that's exactly right, so that essentially just represents the cash flow between the end of December and the expected closing date.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
And the debt level that Microsemi has is a bit lower from what it was at that time. They have paid some debt down.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
That's helpful, and then any color on how this process through MOFCOM would differ from prior?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So last time we had MOFCOM approval was when we bought Microsemi (sic) [SMSC], which was in 2012. At that time, MOFCOM didn't have a lot of resources. The M&A activity wasn't as brisk, and it was largely few deals used to require MOFCOM and was a long process. It seemed relatively unorganized back then. Any of the deals we have done in between, including ISSC, Supertex, Micrel, and Atmel, none of them required MOFCOM. You require MOFCOM if both entities, buyer and the seller, exceed a threshold of revenue in Mainland China. I think the number is $83.6 million, but don't exactly hold me to it. It's in that range, and none of our other acquisitions have required MOFCOM.
So since 2012, this is the first time we applied for MOFCOM, and we have found that MOFCOM is now substantially very well-organized, has a very good procedure. They take the first month to identify a given transaction to be a simple procedure or a normal procedure. Simple procedure usually is cleared within 30 days, and a normal procedure takes a little longer. So that's why when our transaction was rated by MOFCOM to be under simple procedure, that was encouraging news and we shared it with the investors. That happened on May 19 (sic) [April 19] (40:17), so 30 days really end on May 18. There's no guarantee that even under simple procedure, you get it on that day or not or it takes longer or any new questions emerge, but we're pretty optimistic that this is going very, very smooth and we should be getting approval very rapidly here.

Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
That's very helpful. If I could ask one question to either you or Ganesh, impressive performance with Microchip 2.0 initiatives driving a 20% increase in parts per system board. As you look ahead to Microsemi, how does Microsemi impact that growth rate on your design wins on a per system board basis? Thanks, guys.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Go ahead, Ganesh.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So it's early days. What we are very encouraged by is the methodology that Microsemi uses for their equivalent of Total System Solutions. I showed some examples during the Investor Day on March 1, and they have an extremely well organized approach of how to take products from multiple business units and position them into the end markets that they're providing solutions for. And in the early discussions between the two companies, we have both identified places where each other's products can further strengthen those demo boards or reference designs or customer propositions that we can get.
So it's too early to tell you what the rate will be, but I am very encouraged by how the approach is common and the employees of the two companies are looking for ways to exploit that farther after the close.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Great, thanks again.

Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey. Thanks, guys. Steve, now that we're working through the June quarter, can you just give us your best guess of combined seasonality for you guys plus Atmel for the September and December quarters, and then also maybe compare this deceleration that we've just seen versus the deceleration that occurred at the end of 2014?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So I think – I don't really have numerical numbers for all the quarters for seasonality. I believe that the December and March quarters continue to be weak quarters, and June and September continue to be strong quarters, so we're guiding good sequential growth in June. And I would expect the same thing for September, and then December is usually the weakest quarter for the combined companies. And March, also driven by the Atmel seasonality, is slightly negative although this quarter we just announced was slightly positive. So I don't think that has changed, strong June, strong September, weakest December, and a weak March. Mind you, this is all going to change with Microsemi, whose seasonality we do not understand yet. And the second part of your question was what?
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yes, just compare the deceleration that we've seen with lead times coming in to what happened in 2014. We had a deceleration back then. It was obviously a little bit sharper, but it seems like the time period was roughly the same. Would you agree with that?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
2014 deceleration was driven by a significant slowdown in China that everybody saw. I don't recall what caused that. I think there were some government regulations change, reduced some of the subsidies from the various markets. There were a lot of things, and it was so clearly driven by China.
This deceleration is not driven by any place. World economies are synchronously going up, and I think the business environment is pretty good worldwide. This is just as the longer lead times are coming in, basically business is going back to normal, so I don't really think it's at all like 2014.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay, thanks. That's helpful.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Investors and analysts have been trying to compare this to 2014. Ever since we put the letter out on April last year, there has been the talk, everybody trying to compare it to 2014, and it's nothing like 2014. We've been telling you that this will soft-land, and I think you've got to give it to me that we have soft-landed it completely.

Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Hey, thank you, Steve, and congratulations, excellent results. So a perfect segue into my question, so now that the soft landing I think you said is complete, would you give us an idea of what you're thinking in terms of just your part of the business, not MSCC, but just your part of the business and how it plays out as far as growth is concerned? And I have a question that's a follow-up.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I think it's the same question I just answered, strong June, strong September. You should see good results from us for this quarter and the next quarter, and then we go into a slow December and slow March. I think the numbers we have talked about before, mid to high single-digit growth, I think that's where we are and that's what the current guidance is, and I think the business has gone to normal after a soft landing.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Fair enough, Steve. And then your MCU business is pretty strong. I think you mentioned 2.5 times the growth rate. A lot of the large players play in the same markets as you. Everybody's targeting industrial and automotive, but you guys are doing substantially better. Is share take all of it, or are there other things going on, Steve, in your opinion?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Go ahead, Ganesh. Do you want to take that?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
A substantial portion of it is taking share. I think we're also consistent in an approach that isn't picking we're only going to do 32 bits and not focus on others. We are broad-based between 8 bits, 16 bits, and 32 bits. We find the spots that each of them succeed in. Each of them is growing. They're setting new records as they're growing. And so that breadth of what we have in solutions, how we go to market in many ways differentiates us from other people who may have a little different way of how they want to go to market. And I think the results show that, and year-in and year-out the market share has been growing, the position in that ranking has been growing. So I think there's no one silver bullet that's causing it, but our approach in go-to-market across the microcontrollers is contributing to the differentiated results in microcontrollers.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Thanks, guys.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I would add to that, Harsh, that we are rapidly being perceived as the most reliable microcontroller supplier. They have seen significant challenges in delivery and other problems from our competitors both in Japan and Europe, and you know the names of those companies. Those companies have discontinued or end-of-life'd their large number of products from some of the companies they have merged with and created significant havoc at the customers. And the other company that is in play right now waiting for the China MOFCOM, they have seen significant dislocation or the customers have seen inconsistent supply and challenges.
Microchip absorbed a very large acquisition of Atmel and other companies we have bought before. And what we have done for the customer is then not end-of-life any of the microcontrollers. The customers have a very positive experience with us through all that, and so I think we are the preferred supplier, that's why.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Congratulations, guys. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC
Yes, thank you, and I echo my congratulations. Steve, I was wondering if we could shift the conversation away from inventory and distribution, et cetera, and characterize the demand environment from a qualitative perspective, what you're seeing in industrial IoT, automotive and ADAS, how that's maybe different from last year trends and going forward.

Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I think the demand environment is really as normal as it can be described. There are always outliers, but the demand environment is normal. I just think last year, some of the lead times went out and the environment was more heated. After many, many years of low single-digit growth in the industry, last year industry growth was very positive. This year the growth is less than last year, but growth is still quite healthy, and the business environment is more normal this year than it was last year. I don't think anybody argues the industry can grow 13% – 14% per year. That's what it grew last year, but this year seems to be more normal.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay, got it, so more normalized growth rate versus last year. And then, Eric, in terms of the CapEx, is this kind of – the CapEx is going to change with Microsemi, but I'm wondering if you could give us some insight on how we should think about CapEx in fiscal year 2019 but also more on a longer-term basis.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So for fiscal 2019, we just guided today for CapEx to be between $200 million and $250 million for the year, but that includes about $70 million of building projects. And there can always be some building projects going on, but we've got four different projects around the world that are adding to that that set us up nicely for efficient growth going forward, and we reduce lease costs and things like that. So I'd call that one out of the ordinary. So if you take building projects out of the last fiscal year, fiscal 2018, as well as fiscal 2019, at $170 million to $175 million range for CapEx, I think that's normal in a growth environment.
If for any reason we saw growth decline, our maintenance CapEx is significantly lower than that, and we've seen how that can come down dramatically. But we're investing for growth, we're investing to bring manufacturing activities in house, which enhance our gross margin going forward and give us more control over the overall supply chain, so we'll continue to make those investments.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay, got it, and just one question on deleveraging rapidly. Can you talk about any specific tranches that you're going to start taking out, what the impact will be on the interest expense in the near term and the medium term? Thanks.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So I'll take that question. We're not ready to give specifics yet, but Steve did say in his prepared remarks that really all of our cash flow outside of what we have for investing in the business and CapEx and dividend will be used to rapidly delever. If you look at the combination of Microchip and Microsemi, these are two very high-quality, high-operating margin, high cash flow companies, and those models combined will improve from where they are on day one. And really all that cash generation over the first couple of years is absolutely going to be pay down debt and drive us to that 2.5 times leverage target that Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. So I don't have specifics by quarter or by year, but I think you can do your modeling and come up with a pretty good estimate.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
You can see what we did with the Atmel delevering as well.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC
Excellent, thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
We're going to pay the highest interest first, kind of a no-brainer. And with some regards to looking at what's the fixed debt and what's the variable debt and basically a combination of paying down term loan and the line of credit, some combination of that.

Our next question comes from Gil Alexandre with Darphil Associates. Please go ahead.

Gilbert Alexandre - Darphil Associates
Good morning and congratulations. On the Microsemi acquisition, I don't recall what you thought the earnings accretion might be year one and three. And as you did your due diligence, can you comment on any positive or negative surprises? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
It's a very general question. Since we announced the transaction, we haven't seen any positive or negative surprises. During the diligence prior to announcement of the transaction, we didn't know as much about the company before, so we didn't really have a baseline against we could see that this was a positive or negative. But there always are as we went through various business units and corporate profiles, there were things we liked and the things we did not like. I think it will be probably a longer discussion to go into it, not a way to remember it (54:49) offhand.
I think the next step is when we close the transaction and then spend 90 days with the company, that's when we will see probably what we found as a positive or negative surprise. So probably ask that question in another couple of earnings calls later.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
And maybe I can just add to that to refresh people's memory of what we said on March 1. Things haven't changed from that standpoint. We were assuming a June 2018 close, which is still our expectation. We had indicated that Microsemi would add $0.75 of non-GAAP EPS accretion on an annualized run rate basis in the first year after close, and in the third year after close that we would achieve $300 million in synergy from cost savings and revenue growth, and Microsemi would contribute $1.75 of non-GAAP EPS.

Our next question is from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thanks. Within your microcontroller business, what was the fastest-growing, 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit? And is it units driving the growth or dollars?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Steve, I can take that. We don't break out growth rates for revenue by segment of the microcontrollers. As you can follow from the prepared remarks, all of them have been setting new records, so there's no one of them that is providing the growth that is offsetting any of the other ones. We're very happy with all three of them. And I think outside of that, there's nothing more to say.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, I know you don't break it out by end markets, but can you say what area of the world that you're seeing the best growth from?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So our growth is reflected in how revenue for the company is broken out by the regions of the world, so we have just under 20% in the Americas, just over 20% in Europe, and the balance is all in Asia. Now, Asian revenue reflects not only local consumption and local demand creation, but also represents business that is manufactured there for U.S. or other European companies, which then go back to the originating country. So that growth is very similar to the growth rates by end market, and the microcontrollers being such a dominant portion of Microchip at 65% revenue are going to be in the same range as what Microchip is growing in any of those regions of the world.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Charles Kazarian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hi, this is Charlie Kazarian on behalf of John Pitzer. Thanks for letting me ask a question today. I was hoping to dive a little bit deeper into the March quarter revenue. Specifically, you narrowed rev guidance on March 1 with a midpoint that was mostly unchanged. Could you just talk a little bit more about what specific buckets of revenue saw upside over the remaining month of the quarter? Thank you.

Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I don't think we have that data by bucket. By buckets, I don't know whether you mean geographically buckets or you mean by end markets or you mean by product line?
Charles Kazarian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Just generically end markets or product lines or whatever you could provide would be helpful. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
End markets we don't know because on a quarterly basis, we cannot break our business by the end markets across 115,000 customers where 53% of the business is through distribution. So we only provide that data once in a while after we do some painstaking amount of work, so we don't really have the data by end market. By product line, Eric, any nuggets of where the extra growth came from?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Honestly, I think from March 1 to the close, we saw strength across really all of the product lines. They all performed well. You will definitely see that in the quarter the analog business performed better than the microcontroller business, but that was the opposite the quarter before that.
So Europe was very strong. That's typically what we see in the March quarter and it closed out strong, but I really don't think that we can peg it down like that, just good overall growth across the various product lines.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
And we cleared some delinquencies that helped in the month of March, helped the growth that we had been expecting versus what we actually saw.
Charles Kazarian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC

Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thanks, guys, and nice execution on the quarter. So I like the sell-through that you guys are going to report. I wish more people would do that as well. Perhaps you guys can describe how big that difference is between sell-through and sell-in that we've seen in the past.
And then, Steve, I almost get the sense that you philosophically are against sell-in. Some people think it creates bad behaviors. You're not going to incentivize your sales force on sell-in. I was wondering if you could talk about philosophically how you view that. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So you're absolutely correct. We are philosophically against sell-in because in sell-in, your relationship with distributors is built on commercial making the deals with the buyers in distribution to stuff the channel essentially. Hey, buy more of my parts, buy more of my parts. In a sell-through, the incentivization of the sales force to your effort is in driving design wins to revenue, so that the parts are going out from distributor shelves to the end customer, and that's the main difference.
Company after company that we've been involved in, the companies we have bought, Atmel and Micrel and others, they all had sell-in revenue recognition. And now we know their history, we have their records, we have their books, and the amount of managing the quarter that goes on at the end of the quarter by giving distribution deals, from pricing concessions to payment terms to buddy-buddy distribution, please take another $10 million from me, all that happens is really bad behavior, and it doesn't represent demand.
During the last few years as FASB was looking at defining revenue recognition, we fought that. I think we wrote a paper on it a long time ago, but FASB went down their decision where the revenue recognition for GAAP has to be sell-in. So we lost that battle, and so therefore, we have to announce GAAP based on sell-in, but we're not going to throw our religion away. We're going to manage the business based on sell-through. We're going to create demand. Our motto is drive design wins to revenue. We're going to incentivize our people. All bonus programs will be based on sell-through. We're going to measure distribution based on sell-through, but we'll go through an SEC-required GAAP exercise to report as sell-in.

Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Great, thanks for that color, and thanks for offering sell-through. Going forward for me, OpEx was a tiny bit higher as a percentage of revenue. Perhaps just if you guys could, talk about where those investments are going, thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I don't think the changes are meaningful in terms of any conscious investments we made anywhere. I think it's just a large juggernaut, and there are lots of moving parts, exchange rates too. In the first quarter, you have some of the social security payments come back in for some of the people who are maxed out in the later quarters, and you could have slightly lower turnover, higher turnover and not being able to replace the people. So it's just a whole bunch of moving parts. There was really nothing – no conscious decisions were made to invest more or less.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Great. Thanks, guys.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you. Do you have anything to add, Eric?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I'm just going to add one thing onto that. So we've been operating below what Microchip has said has been our operating expense model. And to drive a 40% operating margin company, you have to make investments in R&D, in technical salespeople, in support functions and everything that goes into it. We have a lot of open requisitions in the company and we're going to continue to make those investments to make sure our business just isn't strong today but it's strong 3, 5, 10 years from now.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP

Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning, great execution on the fiscal 2018 performance. The analog business drove about half of the incremental upside in the March quarter and it grew about 5% year over year. That's nice acceleration from the 1.5% growth in the prior quarter and a deceleration trend prior to that, and this is despite the reclassification headwinds. Is the year-over-year reacceleration a reflection of the increased attach rates you're achieving per program, as you highlighted at Analyst Day, or do you think it's just normal quarterly fluctuations?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So there's certainly some of that, which is a reflection of work we have done previously from an attach standpoint. And we've been telling you for several quarters that the headwind is only because of the way we reclassify it, but that the underlying fundamentals of the analog business and what we're doing to create growth and attach and all those other things remain intact.
Quarter to quarter you're going to see fluctuations on it, but I think the longer-term trend you should expect is that analog will have nice growth associated with what we can do with selling it as a part of our total system solutions.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thanks for the insights there. And aerospace and defense is only about 2% of core Microchip business pre-Microsemi. That percentage mix increases about 5.5x with Microsemi. I've heard that AMD is more sticky than your industrial products. I hear margins in AMD are better than industrial. First of all, would you agree with that? And does Microchip have a family of high-rel radiation-hardened MCUs, or is that something you guys hope to achieve with the Microsemi team? Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So clearly, the portion of our business that will be aerospace, defense, and space will grow up with Microsemi. It is very sticky business. It is high-margin business. And so in that sense, it joins the family of industrial and automotive and other product lines we have that have similar characteristics. Some of the work technically that we have to do also take advantage of what we have to do for industrial and automotive.

Specific to the rad-hard product line, yes, we do have rad-hard microcontrollers. Some of that work obviously started from Atmel and what they had been doing prior to the acquisition. And Microchip had been building more products that were ready for defense business but the rad-hard portion came really from the Atmel heritage. And it will grow significantly with Microsemi's portfolio, which is quite rich in other areas as well of defense and aerospace.

Thanks, Jalene. Revenue for the fourth quarter ended at approximately $216 million, $5 million less than the low end of our guidance, and down 6% sequentially. We saw a deceleration in revenue as we exited Q4 with broad market weakness primarily impacting IoT and Infrastructure. For the full year, we grew revenue by $100 million or 13% ending at $868 million with $63 million derived from our organic portfolio and $37 million from the addition of Z-Wave. IoT ended the quarter at $119 million, down 5% sequentially and up 9% Q4 year-on-year.
Fourth quarter wireless revenue was roughly flat sequentially. Q4 MCU revenue was down due to a weakening macro environment. Revenue from infrastructure products was down ending at $46 million declining 13% sequentially and up 18% Q4 year-on-year. Isolation product sales declined more than we expected on industrial weakness, particularly in China. Timing revenue was down slightly.
Fourth quarter Broadcast revenue was slightly better than we expected, ending at $35 million, down 3% both sequentially and year-on-year. Q4 automotive revenue was down, while consumer revenue was up sequentially. In 2018, we increased our global market share in flat-panel TVs to more than 80% with our industry-leading TV tuners. Access product sales declined for the quarter ending at $15 million, down about 7% sequentially and 8% Q4 year-on-year.
Looking at fourth quarter revenue by end market, we saw broad sequential declines in the Industrial, Communications, and Automotive segments. The consumer end market was up for the quarter on strength in broadcast.

Looking at full year 2018, we saw the greatest strength in the industrial end market, which grew over 20%. The communications and automotive end markets were also up for the year. Geographically, we saw the greatest weakness in the fourth quarter sequential revenue performance in the Americas led by declines in Wireless, Automotive, Isolation, and Access. APAC was down slightly with declines in broad-based MCUs and isolation products offset some by growth in Access. Europe was up slightly for the quarter on strength in wireless. Looking at full year 2018, we saw growth in all geographies, led by the Americas and followed by APAC.
Distribution revenue was 69% of total Q4 revenue. For 2018, our 10 largest end customers accounted for 20% of our revenues and no customer represented more than 5%. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter ended slightly better than we expected at 60.6% on product mix. Q4 non-GAAP OpEx ended at $88 million, in line with expectations. Non-GAAP R&D expense for the quarter was $49 million, up slightly on seasonal fringe and new products costs and non-GAAP SG&A ended at $39 million, flat to Q3.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter ended at 19.6%. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margin improved 70 basis points over 2017, ending at 21.2%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 6.4% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower taxes on our offshore earnings and a benefit from the annual U.S. R&D tax credit.
Non-GAAP EPS ended at $0.91 at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to lower fourth quarter revenue. Non-GAAP earnings for the full year improved to $3.71, up 14% versus 2017. On a GAAP basis, our Q4 gross margins ended at 60.4%, GAAP operating expenses were $112 million in line with expectations with R&D expenses at $63 million and SG&A expenses at $49 million. Stock compensation expense was $13 million for the quarter with amortization of intangible assets ending at $11 million, both in line with expectations. We had a $2 million or 15.6 GAAP effective tax benefit in the fourth quarter and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.35. Full year 2018 GAAP earnings ended at $1.90.
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $620 million in cash and investments. Accounts receivable were down for the quarter ending at $73 million or 31 days sales outstanding. Our operations teams leveraged our scalable, fabulous manufacturing model, and effectively managed inventory which declined to $75 million or 4.6 turns, in line with our corporate objectives.
Operating cash flow for the year was $174 million. We executed additional share repurchases in Q4, bringing the 2018 year-to-date total to $39 million. Heading into 2019, we have approximately $160 million of our share repurchase authorization remaining.
I will now cover guidance for the first quarter. In light of macro uncertainty and volatility, we are broadening our guidance range and expect first quarter revenue to be between $183 million to $193 million. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be 60%. In response to the anticipated decline in first quarter revenue, we are slowing OpEx growth and expect Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $90 million.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter is expected to be 13% and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.52. On a GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to be 60%. We expect GAAP operating expenses to be $114 million. In Q1, we expect GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 10% with a GAAP loss per share between $0.11 and $0.01.
I will now turn the call over to Tyson.
Tyson Tuttle
Thank you, John. We are proud of our performance in 2018, which was a strong year for Silicon Labs in many dimensions. We completed the successful acquisition of Z-Wave and grew our revenue by $100 million. We strengthened our team with the addition of critical leadership sales, applications, customer support and software expertise. Silicon Labs' innovative culture attracts outstanding talent who are foundational to our success.

In 2018, our opportunity pipeline achieved record growth, up more than 40% to $11 billion in lifetime revenue. We also achieved record design wins, which increased approximately 30% year-on-year, providing a strong tailwind for future growth and a validation of our strategy.
Fourth quarter results were weaker than we expected and our first quarter outlook is down sharply with the broad-based slowdown in our bookings and revenue outlook. We attribute these shortfalls, primarily to the macro environment and not to share loss. Economic conditions are decelerating in major markets around the world, which is causing an acceleration of the semiconductor industry down cycle. In Q4, for example, we saw sequential declines in our MCU and isolation products, which are among our broadest product lines and most strongly correlated to overall economic conditions.
China, in particular, is facing a difficult environment with the slowdown in overall GDP performance and factory activity combined with customers moving production to other geographies due to concerns over tariffs. We've also seen an accumulation of inventory at certain of our key end customers.
As we entered 2019, we are closely monitoring the macro environment in managing headcount growth in discretionary expenditures to drive an OpEx level that is lower than we initially contemplated.
Turning now to product updates. Infrastructure delivered a phenomenal 2018 with revenue growing by more than 30% and design wins lifetime revenue up approximately 50%.
Isolation product revenue grew more than 40% annually and timing products grew 25% over the same period. Silicon Labs' digital isolation products continue to replace traditional optocouplers enabling higher performance, reliability, integration and best-in-class safety for designs requiring protection from high voltages.
In 2018, we saw strengths across a broad range of applications, including power supplies, solar, industrial and automotive. We've established ourselves as a leading provider of digital isolation technology to the cloud, telecom and electric vehicle markets.
Traditionally our timing products have targeted the core optical networking market. During 2018, we expanded and diversified our timing revenue into industrial, datacenter and wireless infrastructure markets, which combined now represents approximately 40% of overall timing revenue.
IoT products grew 17% in 2018 to more than $460 million, including $37 million from our acquisition of Z-Wave in Q2. Wireless products now make up more than 60% of total IoT revenue and delivered nearly 30% year-on-year growth. We saw modest annual growth in our MCU and sensor products.
Despite the late product ramps in 2018 with high volume lighting customers, the transition from SMETS1 to SMETS2 in the UK smart metering market and macro factors, we remain confident in our design win pipeline and market position. The full year 2018, we saw approximately 50% growth in our IoT opportunity funnel to $8 billion, and nearly 30% growth in IoT design win lifetime revenue.
We continue to strengthen our portfolio, driving capabilities and differentiation, while advancing security and growing ecosystem partnerships. Our connectivity portfolio is gaining significant traction as we target low power wireless end nodes with a broad range of protocols and optimal combinations for target market segments in smart home, industrial, metering, commercial, consumer and lighting.
In Q4, we launched the next-generation Z-Wave 700 on our Wireless Gecko platform, delivering on our vision and platform integration roadmap and enhancing our product offering to the Z-Wave ecosystem. Our new smart home platform builds on Z-Wave's industry leading S2 security and interoperability, improving batter life and adding higher performance in longer-range RF capabilities.

IDC estimates, the worldwide smart home market will grow at an approximate 20% compound annual growth rate from 2017 to 2022 as the market balloons to 1.3 billion devices shipped annually with much of that adoption in growth driven by sensors enabling AI and edge computing applications. Advances in wireless technologies such as Z-Wave 700 are driving the battery power sensitive trend and making these devices easier to install and deploy. Silicon Labs is well-positioned to consolidate the smart home experience and drive the IoT adoption in this market.
Earlier this week we announced the release of new Bluetooth 5.1 software for our Wireless Gecko platform further expanding the capabilities of our portfolio. Silicon Labs' new solution will be beyond points of two point connectivity to include advanced angle of arrival and angle of departure technology for more precise indoor positioning and location services used in a wide range of applications, including factory automation, retail and smart cities.
During the quarter we announced the expansion of our groundbreaking Wi-Fi portfolio featuring modules and transceivers designed specifically for the IoT. We offer the lowest power Wi-Fi devices on the planet enabling IoT end node designs that work possible until now. Developers can create products with best-in-class power efficiency, superior interference rejection, wireless coexistence and advanced security. The portfolio cuts power consumption in half compared to competitive offerings providing an ideal Wi-Fi solution for power sensitive connected products, including battery-operated IP security cameras, point-of-sale standards, asset trackers and personal medical devices. 
Earlier this month at CES in Las Vegas we saw growing momentum in the IoT and a lot of customer excited about our solutions. At CES, we announced that Xiaomi, a leading IoT ecosystem provider in China, launched new smart lighting products based on Silicon Labs' Wireless Gecko SoCs and Bluetooth mesh software. We are seeing increasing deployment of Bluetooth mesh in China's fast-growing smart home market. And Xiaomi is poised to ship mesh-enabled smart home products at scale, driving further adoption of this versatile ubiquitous wireless technology.
Also at CES, Tuya, a leading AI and IoT platform provider in China, announced they are using Silicon Labs' Wireless Gecko platform, including SoCs, ZigBee and Bluetooth software to enable their smart multiprotocol products to easily connect to multi-node mesh networks deployed in smart homes. Tuya's production-ready smart solutions address the real world needs of IoT manufacturers, supply chains, e-commerce channels and retailers worldwide, and we are playing a role in their success.
I'm delighted to announce Christy Wyatt's appointment to our Board of Directors. As a thought leader in the cyber security industry Christy brings extensive experience developing and scaling technology companies. She is currently CEO of Absolute Software Corporation, which specializes in self-healing endpoint security technology. With more than two decades of leadership experience, including Citigroup, Motorola Mobility, Apple and Palm, Christy's skills and expertise will be invaluable to Silicon Labs as we chart our course into the future.
In 2018, we capped off an outstanding year by winning for the fourth year in a row the Global Semiconductor Alliance's Most Respected Public Semiconductor Company award. It's a great honor to be chosen by our industry peers based on best products, vision and future opportunities. Despite current volatility, we remain confident about our longer-term ability to outperform the market. We are focused on executing on our product roadmaps and converting a large pipeline of opportunities into additional wins and share gains. The technologies we are developing are enabling our customers to transform industries and improve life, and together we are creating a smarter, more connected world.

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.
Matt Ramsay
Tyson, obviously -- the soft and bit cloudy macro environment, but maybe you could give us a little more color in terms of end market weakness into the first quarter, if there is any differentiation across the end markets in the IoT business? And then, second, to what extent do you feel like the outlook you given for the first quarter is reflecting just, maybe inventory been taking down at some of the channel partners and distributors [ph] versus the organic sort of slower growth that we're seeing in end markets? Any context there will be helpful. Thank you.
Tyson Tuttle
Yes, so, let me take the first part, and I'll let John talk about the second part. In terms of end market weakness, if we talk about IoT, we've had continuing weakness in the UK smart metering market, which we expect to recover in 2019. And we also have had some weakness in the lighting market, which has continued in some excess inventory there. But again, we believe that that will be ramping as we move throughout the year. So those two did contribute to the Q4 results and continued into Q1 or continuing into Q1. If you look at really the MCU business and our Isolation business are both very broad in terms of the applications and customer base. And both of those were impacted by the macro and just down overall, and particularly in China. And so I think that we've seen a number of the customer push-outs and inventory situations in the China market in particular. And so that was -- that's a factor as we exited Q4 and into Q1. So it's really the broad product lines have the most significant impact on the numbers and overall. In timing, it was okay and in wireless, continued to see some ramp, but overall, the general direction was down as we exited Q4.
John Hollister
Matt, this is John. I just like to add on that on the inventory side we do think there is a takedown of end customer inventory and process, and we also see that distributors were aggressively managing inventory as we rounded out the fourth quarter heading into the first quarter. That should bode well for a recovery as the days in inventory and distribution are not excessive, but it did impact our final Q4 results last year.
Matt Ramsay
Just to follow on to that last comment John, maybe, I know, it’s a tough environment to look out too far. We’re just trying to get our heads around here on questions I’m getting around the full year for the IoT business. You guys give longer term targets and that target has been 20% growth for a while. And obviously, we're starting off a rough spot for the year. So any thoughts about annualized growth for 2019 would be helpful realizing that's a tough ask in this state, but appreciate it. Thank you.
John Hollister
The commentary there is we do expect a rebound in the second quarter that’s based on strong design win performance last year combined with inputs from our customers and distribution partners as well as healthier bookings rates for last couple of weeks certainly versus what we saw in the month prior. So rebound in Q2 followed by onward growth in the second half is our expectation right now, and of course we will be able to provide better indications of that as the year progresses here.
Operator
The next question comes from Gary Mobley with Benchmark. Please go ahead.

Gary Mobley
Given that we're starting the year out in a bit of a whole with respect to top line, even if we see better than seasonal trends as the year unfolds, it's going to be tough to grow revenue in 2019. And as well, just given where operating margin is expected to start in the first quarter, it’s going to be a pretty tough comp on the operating margin in 2019. So the question is how long are you willing to go before becoming more proactive and rightsizing the OpEx to deliver some stabilization there, if not improvement.
John Hollister
Yes, Gary, this is John. I mean, first of, I think, your observations there are sound. But we think the thing to do is to be diligent and cautious in our spending, but not overreact. And we do see very strong design win momentum in the business. We have a leading position in strong secular growth markets, and feel it's very important to maintain that position. We will see how the year unfolds and we will remain diligent in that. But I think, right now, we’ve taken steps to control the OpEx here in first quarter and we'll continue to monitor this as the year progresses.
Gary Mobley
Okay. As a follow up, I just have a housekeeping question. John, what would you expect your full year 2019 non-GAAP tax rate to approximate?
John Hollister
13% is the best view I can give you at the moment, Gary.
Operator
The next question comes from Cody Acree with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Cody Acree
So Maxim last night said that they were starting to see some improved order trends for bookings over the last few weeks broadly. It did sound like your comments just in the last question or two were somewhat similar. Are you starting to see any improvement [indiscernible]?
John Hollister
Cody this is John. The answer is yes. We have seen better performance there in the last few weeks over the month prior. Yes, we have.
Cody Acree 
Can you maybe give us any visibility as to the end markets that you are starting to see that in ?
John Hollister
It's fairly consistent. And I just want to add on to some of the commentary Tyson was talking about moments ago. We also have seen a relatively weak automotive market in the second half of 2018 and heading into the beginning of this year. We’re seeing that beginning to improve a bit, but it’s improvements in the bookings has been fairly broad-based.
Cody Acree
And I guess lastly then just for your weakness in China, where are you specifically seeing that? And are you starting to see any trends change in China?
John Hollister
Little too early to call it there specifically, but just adding on to what types of MCU and Isolation were particularly weak in China as we rounded out the year.

Maybe turn around as you look at this year, it's probably difficult to give full year guidance. So maybe you can highlight in certain products or areas that you actually expect to see some transactional growth versus, obviously, the macro slowdown.
John Hollister
Yes. So I think the best indication of the growth potential in the business is in the pipeline and in the design win traction. So we have 50% growth of our infrastructure design win pipeline. And in IoT, we had about 30% year-on-year growth in the design win pipeline. And so that is not in the pipeline but in the design wins themselves. And that translates into revenue and would be anticipated to ramp as we move through 2018 or 2019. So you look at the number of customers, you see us a fantastic tons of opportunities, multiple programs, multiple large customers. The question is just how quickly will that turn into revenue and how the macro impacts. We’re going into Chinese New Year, we got a Trade War. We've got debt concerns and other things. But at the same time, we're quite bullish in terms of our product portfolio, the areas that we’re in terms of IoT and smart home and lighting and commercial. And lots of things around IoT are doing well. The trend towards all the data out in the market going into data centers and high speed communications and wireless and our expansion into those areas and timing. And then in Isolation, the trend toward electrification, electric vehicles and all of the power devices that go out into the market, solar, motor controls, power supply. So we're well positioned in terms of the portfolio, well positioned competitively and well positioned in terms of the design win traction that we have. But that’s really not immune to macro. And we'll see how we come out of the first quarter. Right now things are looking like they are picking up a bit, but it's still a little bit really and we need to get through Q1 and see how the rest of year is going to turn out.

Blayne Curtis
And then I just wanted to ask you the one area that seems to be good is 5G infrastructure. I know your timing has been more wired focus. You did mention some early ramps in wireless. Can you just give us a picture as to when you see that being more material for you?
John Hollister
We have design wins in some of the early 5G. We’re calling it 4.5G base stations that are going to start -- ramping this year. And then certainly 5G, as we look a little bit further out. So we got strong road map and strong engagements on the wireless side with our timing products. There is also little bit on the isolation products within the power supplies for all of those types of devices. So just overall having 40% of the timing revenue now outside the core optical networking market really shows. And we've been talking about this for a long time. But a lot of these are very high quality long-term wins that take a while the ramp. But seeing industry data center and wireless all ramping on timing bodes well for the portfolio.

The next question comes from Suji Desilva with ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.
Suji Desilva
Maybe you guys kind of step back, Tyson, to describe this downturn you're seeing industrial or broadly. How it compares to past cycles? If you give us some color there that might be helpful that kind of came on very quickly. So the context will be appreciated.
Tyson Tuttle
Yes. I mean, it's been nearly a decade since we have had any sort of a macro correction. The question is, is this one going to be short-lived with a quick rebound or is it going to be more protracted? And I think that really depends a little bit on how the U.S.-China relationship turns out in terms of -- while with GTE in terms of the tariffs. We're certainly seeing a bit more churn in terms of moving production from one location to another and inventory and lots of movements there, which is caused pause in lot of the ordering patterns. So I would say that the geopolitical factors and the trade factors are much more turbulent now than they were before. This is being caused by different set of factors out in the macro economy. It's not housing bubble. You've also got U.S. consumer confidence remains strong. And we finally have a -- let up on that, at least a pod on the government shutdown. And hopefully that -- we can sell through that. So if we can keep the consumer confidence up and we see a more normal return to growth, I think, then we can start seeing the results of the design win. So hopefully this is a little bit shorter term than what we saw back in 2008. But we really have to get through the year to see how it's all going to turn out.
Suji Desilva
That’s helpful, Tyson. And then one quick follow-up on the Wi-Fi part of the business, which is newer. Can you just talk about your expectations for how much -- how quickly that ramps and grow? Does that remain a kind of a niche effort relative to your Bluetooth and ZigBee connectivity? And what’s your prospects -- what are the prospects of that business?
Tyson Tuttle
We’re excited about our Wi-Fi portfolio. We've been out -- sampling this to a lot of customers for about a year. It creates the lowest power Wi-Fi solution. And we have a lot of customers that are using multiple protocols that are using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and ZigBee in different configurations. And as we integrate these solutions together and are able to offer that further strengthens both the Wi-Fi portfolio, but certainly our position in the rest of the portfolio as well. So we see that product ramping modestly this year. And it's a very important standard. There were a lot of Wi-Fi devices out in SCS. And we will see how the market uptake on a number of these things that were designed into. But it's an exciting new expansion of our stand. And I think reflects our long-term commitment to be the leading provider of IoT wireless technology.

Operator
The next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Tore Svanberg
First question, Tyson you talked before about how security is becoming a very important part of your IoT offering and front and back security on a lot of your newer products. Could you talk a little bit about what that means for you when it comes to compound or maybe growth reaccelerating in IoT?
Tyson Tuttle
Security is an absolutely important technology and set of capabilities for the IoT. And I think to the extent that we can make security bullet proof and easy to use, it will accelerate the market for these devices. If you look at our first-gen devices, we have a strong offering of security technology and the ability to drive very low power encryption and advanced algorithms and that’s integrated within our FDK. As we move out to our second generation platform, we’re integrating additional secure element functionality into the devices. Think of it is payment level security, where you can store keys, and you have very advanced hardware. So you can’t tamper -- anti-tamper, and you can’t hack into these devices even more than you would have in the first gen. So it's something that we’re investing in. It also opens up some additional opportunities to add key management. And you can individually address devices and push software updates at a very, very secure manner. And that opens up some potential new capabilities for our customers, but also capabilities for us to potentially monetize that as we move out in time. But the security is absolutely essential to the deployment and security of all these IoT devices and making people confidence that it's bulletproof is, I think really essential. So it’s a huge amount of investment and attention that we’re putting onto the portfolio around the security. And we think that can be a significant differentiator for us.
Tore Svanberg
That’s helpful. And my follow-up for John. John you're talking about being prudent on OpEx. Yet it's guided to be up sequentially. I believe it's about 48% of revenue. Will you take further actions here to try and get the OpEx down somewhat?
John Hollister
Yes, Tore, we -- there is a seasonal aspects to the increase in the first quarter. You have a multibillion dollar increase just naturally given the seasonal French reset that we go through every year. So putting that aside, we are managing the OpEx cautiously, and we will continue to monitor this as we go forward. And we look forward for a recovery in the business really as the key and X-factor to monitor here.
Operator
The next question comes from Alessandra Vecchi with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Alessandra Vecchi
Just as a clarification, what you said your wireless revenue is roughly flat sequentially. Was that on organic basis or was that including Z-Wave?
John Hollister
That was including Z-Wave.
Alessandra Vecchi
Okay. And then additionally as you pointed out your broadcast business came in better than expected and quite better than I had modeled. How should we think about that going forward into next year? I know your strategic goal has been down 10% annually. But do you think this sort of the strength on the consumer side can hold up a little bit longer than expected?
John Hollister
Yes, if you look at broadcast overall for the year, while Q4 was relatively flat, it was down about 8% year-on-year. And we have a target of 10% down. And so we actually held share a little bit more. We added 80% design market share in the flat penalties with our tenders. And we see that model of 10% down both for Access and Broadcast is being consistent for the long-term performance of those. So we outperformed that in both for Access and Broadcast this last year and maintained share. And feel good about our competitive position in those markets.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Rajvindra Gill
… Z-Wave and organic.
John Hollister
Rajvi, its John. We didn’t catch you at the beginning. Please begin your question from the top.
Rajvindra Gill
I apologize if this question was asked. I joined a bit late, but the IoT kind of breakdown between organic versus Z-Wave. If you look at your 10-Q in September, you did about $20.5 million of Z-Wave since March. So that equated to about $13 million of revenue from Z-Wave in September. So if we assume kind of a similar type of rate in Q4, the organic IoT business is going to be down about 3% year-over-year in Q4 and maybe down again on year-over-year basis in Q1. You had mentioned that you saw continued weakness in the UK smart metering. I was under the impression that those customers had transitioned to the SMETS2 standard and that we are going to start to see more proliferation there. Is this has to do with more macro related issues in England itself related to Brexit? I just wanted to get little bit clarity on IoT breakdown in UK smart metering and expectations of a ramp in the second half because that’s very -- your IoT organic growth is very dependent on those specific areas.
John Hollister
Yes, so if you look at the organic growth and we kind break that down within IoT, we saw microcontrollers down fairly strongly -- double-digit down from Q3 to Q4 and anticipated to take another step down here in Q1. So that’s the microcontroller portion. So that's definitely a strong drag on the year-on-year comparison. And that's really macro across the board 8-bit, 32-bit low power automotive broad-based, all of the microcontrollers are consistently seeing those trends. If you look within the wireless portfolio, we've actually seen our more industrial proprietary wireless stuff be fairly stable as we go from Q3 to Q4 into Q1. And those are heavy industrial compatible with legacy networks and also upgradable to more advance things. So that’s actually held in fairly well where we seen a stronger impact that's been in the Zigbee, in the mesh 15.4 area. And we saw pretty solid growth as we came through the year of Q3. But then as we came into Q4, that took a hit. That was overall for the year. It was impacted by the smart energy and lighting. And we thought it was going to be stronger and we got those design wins in place. But here, Q4 and Q1, some of that is kind of, I wouldn’t call it consumer, but its light industrial, it's more of the smart home type stuff. And we've started seeing Q4 and Q1 some weakness there although very strong design wins. And as we look out into the year, both lighting -- those ramps really taking hold and that inventory burning off. And then the smart energy, we think in Q2 the SMETS2 transition is going to really start kicking-in in the smart energy steps. So on the 15.4 Zigbee side, this really looks like a kind of a two-quarter hold with some rebound in Q2 and then a very strong second half with the 15.4. Then on the Bluetooth side, we've been ramping, we talked about Xiaomi, and a lot of these Chinese ecosystems. And they've been very, very successful out in the market. So we see continued little bit of weakness in Q4 and Q1 although that’s on the back of what should have been stronger growth. But then as we go out into '19, that Bluetooth portion, we actually anticipate some share gains there and also just the deployment of the Bluetooth mesh technology. So overall, again, wireless kind of flat from Q3 to Q4, which should have been growth had we not have the macro impact that we saw in December and coming into the quarter. And then we do see a rebound in that coming -- going into Q2, and then the design win traction should really take hold in the second half. So that’s on the IoT side. In terms of year-on-year compares, we’re optimistic about the year, but we’re definitely starting off with Q1 weaker than we would have hoped, but we will see how it turns out. But overall, the design win up 30% year-on-year, last year, and that’s on a pretty big number. We feel good about what we've been able to do on the sales side and driving the pipeline, and driving the customer engagement and the conversion of that into revenue. We will see if we -- as we come in Q2 and into the second half. But it's looking solid from my prospective in terms of the validation of the strategy and the road map. But it's got to turn into numbers.

Rajvindra Gill
That’s helpful. And for my follow-up, with respect to your direct China exposure products that are consumed in China that might be difficult to quantify. What percentage of the MCU, the isolation is exposed to China directly. And I’m just -- a little bit cautious on this idea that the booking rates are improving the last couple weeks. I mean what is the basis of the booking rates improving? What's the rationale? Any kind of insight on that would be helpful. Thanks.
Tyson Tuttle
Yes, in terms of the direct China exposure, we were about -- it's about 30% of our revenue is designed into domestic China customers than either shift worldwide or would shift into the domestic China market. We do have about 60% plus of our revenue shifts into China. But then that's really an ODM relationship or something like that. So it's about -- that's fairly -- you got microcontroller, you've got Isolation, you've got the Infrastructure business, Broadcast, all those are -- do have business within China. I think just relative to a number of other semiconductor companies. I mean, not only do we have a fabulous model, where we can really scale our supply chain, but -- yes, we do probably have a little bit less direct China exposure than some of our direct competitors.
John Hollister
Yes, Rajvi, on the bookings -- this is John. It's really seeing an improvement and what we’re seeing from our distribution partners and that's coming on the back with relatively light inventory levels and distribution, which bodes well for us. And I would say, from here, through the balance of Q1, with -- I would say moderate bookings performance for the remainder of this quarter. We're confident in our guidance that we provided this morning. And seeing how that's affect in Q2 in terms of the bookings, we're in line with a rebound in business for Q2 based on what we see so far. Now, all of that said, yes, there is rare volatility right now than what we've seen in the past and what we would like to see, but we do see those as positive indicators.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase’s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. 
Marianne Lake
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I’m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to disclaimer at the back of the presentation.
Starting on Page 1, the firm reported fourth quarter net income of $7.1 billion and EPS of $1.98 on revenue of nearly $27 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 14%. Market impacts aside, underlying business drivers remain solid, increasing core loans and deposit growth, consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season, faster market activity and the credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses. 
For the full year 2018, the firm reported revenue of $111.5 billion and net income was $32.5 billion, both clear records even adjusting for the impacts of tax reform. And so, we’re entering 2019 with good momentum across all businesses.
Turning to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $26.8 billion was up $1.1 billion or 4% year-on-year, driven by net interest income. NII was up $1.2 billion or 9% on higher rates and on loan and deposit growth. 
Non-interest revenue was down slightly, with lower market levels impacting Asset Wealth Management fees and Private Equity losses being offset by higher Card fees and Auto lease growth in CCB. 
Expense of $15.7 billion was up 6% year-on-year. The increase is related to investments we’re making in technology, marketing, real estate and front office, as well as revenue-related costs including growth in Auto. This was partially offset by a reduction in FDIC fees. As we had hoped, the incremental surcharge was eliminated effective the end of the third quarter and this is a benefit of a little over $200 million for the quarter across our businesses. 
Credit trends remained favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up $240 million year-on-year, driven by changes in reserves. In Consumer, we built reserves of $150 million in Cards on loan growth. 
In Wholesale, over the last several quarters, we have seen net reserve releases and recoveries. However, this quarter, we had about $200 million of credit costs. Again largely reserve builds on select C&I client downgrades driven by a handful of names across multiple sectors. 
While we are constantly looking at the granular level, these downgrades are idiosyncratic and do not reflect signs of deterioration in our portfolio. The outlook for credit as we see it remains positive. 
Shifting for the full year results on Page 3, we have posted net income for the year of $32.5 billion, a return on tangible common equity of 17% and EPS of $9 a share. Net income was a record for the firm, as well as to each of our businesses even exceeding tax reform. 

Revenue of $111.5 billion is also record and was up nearly $7 billion or 7% year-on-year, $4.3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and Card margin expansion being offset by lower markets NII.
Non-interest revenues was up $2.5 billion or 5%, driven by CIB Markets and growth in Consumer being offset by Private Equity losses and the impact of spread widening on FCA. At the end of the year, the adjusted expense was $63.3 billion, up 6%, which brings our overhead ratio to 57% for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise. And although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis, remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth in Cards given tax reform. 
Adjusted for this or looking on a GAAP basis, we delivered nearly 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the year and well over 100 basis points for the fourth quarter. 
On Credit, the environment remained favorable throughout 2018. Credit costs were $4.9 billion, down 8% driven by lower net reserve build in Consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sales. 
Moving on to Page 4 on balance sheet and capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12% flat to last quarter. Risk-weighted assets decreased with loan growth more than offset by derivatives counterparty and trading RWA given a combination of seasonality, market conditions and all the enhancements. Our net payout ratio for the quarter exceeded 100% and we repurchased $5.7 billion of shares. 
Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on Page 5. CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, nearly $15 billion of net income and an ROE of 28%. Customer satisfaction remains near all time highs across our businesses. 
For the quarter, core loans were up 5% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 8%, Card up 6% and Business Banking up 5%. Deposit grew 3%. Growth continues to slow given the rising rate environment, but importantly, we believe we continue to outpace the industry. 
Of note, this quarter, we opened the first 10 branches in our expansion markets increasing D.C., Boston and Philadelphia. And although it’s clearly early, perception in the market and the performance of the new branches has been strong. Despite volatile markets, client investment assets were still up 3% and we saw record net new money flows for the year. 
Card sales were up 10%, debit sales up 11% and merchant processing volume up 17% reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season. And keeping with our focus on digital everything, of note, active mobile customers were up 3 million users or 11% year-on-year.
Revenues of $13.7 billion was up 13%. In Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 18% on higher deposit NII driven by margin expansion. Home Lending revenue was down 8%, driven by lower net production revenues in a low volume, highly competitive environment. 
And of note, while not a material driver of overall expense, revenue headwinds here were offset by lower net production expense. And Cards, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 14%, driven by higher Card NII, although loan growth and margin expansion, lower card, net acquisition costs, principally Sapphire Reserve and higher Auto lease volumes. Card revenue rate was 11.6% for the quarter and 11.27% for the year as expected. 
Expense of $7.1 billion was up 6%, driven by investments in technology and marketing and Auto lease appreciation partly offset by lower FDIC charges and other expense efficiencies. 
On Credit, net charge-offs was down $18 million as modestly higher charge-offs in Card were more than offset by lower charge-offs in Auto and Home Lending. Charge-off rates were down year-on-year across all portfolios. 

Economic indicators remain upbeat. And given the breadth and depth of our franchise, we have a pretty good barometer. From everything we see, the US Consumer remains very healthy. 
Now turning to Page 6 on the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $3 billion and ROE of 10% on revenue of $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the year, net income was nearly $12 billion and an ROE of 16%. In Banking, it was a record year for both total fees and advisory fees. We ranked number one in Global IB fees for the 10th consecutive year, gaining share across all regions. 
Fourth quarter IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 3%. We feel continued momentum in advisory with fees up 38% driven by the closing of several large transactions. For the year, we ranked Number 2 in wallet gaining share. 
Equity underwriting fees were down 4% but significantly outperforming the market. We ranked Number 1 for the year and the quarter and saw our leadership positions across all products globally with particular strength in IPOs as well as in the technology and healthcare sectors.
And debt underwriting fees were down 19% versus a strong prior year and sectors in the market. We maintained our number one brand rank for the year and continued to hold strongly lead-left positions in high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.
Moving to markets. Total revenue was $3.2 billion, down 6% reported and down 11% adjusted for the impact of tax reform and Steinhoff margin loan loss last year. A confluence of factors throughout the quarter including trade, concerns around global growth and corporate earnings, fears of lower mortgage fares as well as other negative headlines caused spikes in volatility which were amplified by markets that assets and liquidity. And although we saw decent client flow, rates rallied, spreads widened and energy prices fell significantly, all against general market conviction that was anticipating a stronger end to the year. As a result, fixed income markets in particular were challenging with revenue down 18% adjusted. Weaker performance across rates, credit trading and commodities was partially offset by good momentum in emerging markets.
Equities revenue was up 2% adjusted, a solid end to a record year. Client continued to do well but we saw client deleveraging over the course of the quarter and cash derivatives were solid in a tougher environment.
Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13%, driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates but also benefitting from fee growth on higher volumes. Security services revenue was a $1 billion, up 1%. Underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit. Credit adjustments and other was a loss of $243 million, reflecting higher funding spreads on all derivatives.
Finally, expense of $4.7 billion was up slightly with continued investments in technology and bankers and volume-related transaction costs, partly offset by lower FDIC charges and lower performance-based compensation. The comps and revenue ratio for the quarter and for the year was 28%.
Moving to commercial banking on page seven. The commercial bank reported net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 20% for the fourth quarter, and for the year $4 billion of net income and a ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.3 billion for the quarter was down 2%, and for prior year included a tax reform related benefit. Excluding this, revenue was up 3%, driven by higher deposit NII. Gross IB revenue of $600 million was down 1% year-on-year but up 4% sequentially on a strong underlying flow of activity, particularly in M&A. Full-year IB revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 4% on strong activity across segments, in particular middle market banking which was up 8%.

Deposit balances were up 1% sequentially as client cash positions are seasonally highest toward year-end although down 7% year-on-year as we continue to see migration of non-operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives. We believe we are retaining a significant portion of these flows. Expense of $845 million was down 7% year-on-year as the prior year included $100 million of impairment on leased assets. Excluding this, expense was up 5%, driven by continued investment in the business in banker coverage as well as in technology and product initiatives.
Loans were up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 1%, reflecting a decline in our tax exempt portfolio given tax reform. Adjusting for this, we would have been up 4%, which is still below the industry as we focus on client selection, pricing and credit discipline. But keep in mind, in areas where we have chosen to grow such as in our expansion markets, we are growing at or about industry benchmarks. CRE loans were up 2%, also below the industry as we proactively slowed our growth due to where we are in the cycle, through continued structural and pricing discipline and targeted selections as we build. Underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs at a $106 million including higher loan loss reserves, largely due to select client downgrades.
Moving on to assets and wealth management on page eight. Assets and wealth management reported net income of $604 million with a pretax margin of 23% and an ROE of 26% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, net income was nearly $3 billion pretax margin at 26% and an ROE of 31%. Revenue of $3.4 billion for the quarter was down 5% year-on-year with the impact of current market levels driving lower investment valuations and management fees as well as to a lesser extent, lower performance fees. These were partially offset by strong banking results and the cumulative impact of net inflows. Expense of $2.6 billion was flat, as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance-based compensation and lower revenue-driven external fees.
For the quarter, we saw net long-term outflows of $3 billion with strength in fixed income more than offset by outflows from equity and multi-asset products. Additionally, we had net liquidity inflows of $21 billion. For the 10th consecutive year, we saw net long-term inflows of $25 billion this year, driven predominantly by multi-assets and in addition saw $31 billion of net liquidity inflows this year. Assets under management of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were both down 2% as the impact of market levels more than offset the benefit of net inflows. Deposits were flat sequentially and down 7% year-on-year, reflecting migration into investments, and we continue to capture the vast majority inflows. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 13% with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending.
Moving to page nine and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $577 million. Treasury and CIO net income of a $175 million was up year-on-year, primarily driven by higher rates. Other corporate saw a net loss of $752 million, including on a pre-tax basis funding our foundation for corporate philanthropy $200 million this quarter, flat year-on-year, and including a $150 million of markdown on certain legacy private equity investments market related. Remainder is driven by tax-related items, totaling a little over a $300 million. And within this are two notable components. The first is regularly tax reserve; and second represents small differences between the effective tax rate for each for our businesses and that for the overall company as we close the year. So, therefore there is an offset across our businesses. Our full-year effective tax rate was just a little over 20%, in line with guidance. 

Moving to page 10 and outlook. We will give you more full-year outlook and sensitivity information at Investor Day as always. However, for now, I would like to provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. Net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates and growth but quarter-over-quarter will be negatively impacted by day count. And we expect the first quarter NII to be relatively flat sequentially. While it’s too early clearly to give guidance on fee revenues, it’s also fair to say that this quarter market is still calmer and more positive and capital market pipelines are strong. So, if the environment remains positive, we would expect normal seasonal strength in the first quarter. But I will remind you that the first quarter of 2018 included a $500 million accounting write off as well as broad strength in performance. Expect expense to be up mid-single-digits year-on-year, obviously market dependent, primarily annualization effects. And finally, as I said, we expect credit to remain favorable across products.
So, to close, while the markets in the fourth quarter were more challenging, we should not lose sight to the fact that 2018 was a strong year, indeed a record for revenues, net income and EPS, both reported and adjusted for tax reform. Fundamental economic data remains supportive of continued growth, and we’re generally constructive on the outlook for 2019. We have good momentum coming into the year and the company and each of our businesses are very well positioned.
With that, operator, we can open up the line for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
Erika Najarian
Hi. Good morning. So, the way bank stocks have performed, clearly, investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near-term and of course credit, which you addressed. I’m wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected, if the overhead ratio of 57% that you posted in ‘17 and ‘18 is something that you could continue to level off to, or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when we’re thinking about the overhead ratio.
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, I would say a couple of things. The first is just to remind you that ‘17 and ‘18, I would look at a GAAP rather than a managed basis because of the adjustments to our revenues from tax reform. But that said, we have -- while we don’t set expense target, nor do we set overhead ratio targets, we have given you some outlook that would suggest that we continue to believe that combination of revenue growth and expense discipline, notwithstanding the investments that we’ve been making, we should see our overhead ratio continue to be stable to trending down to the kind of mid-50, so 55ish%. Obviously, the timing of that will depend on rates and markets and everything else. So, we would expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage on higher NII on growth if nothing else and continued solid growth in fees. Clearly in any one quarter, you can have pluses and minuses that can be market-dependent. But generally, over time, we would still expect those trends.
Erika Najarian
And just as a follow-up question, the market is also thinking that the last rate hike from the Fed was December, and I'm wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if December was indeed the last rate hike for some time.
Marianne Lake
So, I would say, first of all just to say that the question mark about whether that’s a pause or a stop; is it the end of the cycle, we don’t think so. We think the outlook for growth and the economy is still strong; the consumer is still strong and healthy; and we are expecting to still see maybe slower but still global growth going forward. Having said that, just as a general matter, you’ve seen through our earnings at risk that as we have put more and more of the benefit of past rate cut, rate hikes in our run rate, each incremental hike from here has whilst deposited significantly lower sort of incremental NII drive, and that -- the front end SKU is a lower percentage. So, it’s nothing but clearly lower front end rates or lower long end of the curve or a flatter curve, all other things would be net modestly negative. But against that, you pointed out the potential for this to lead to lower or slower reprice.

So, as the Fed pauses, it is fair to say there could be an offset from lower reprice as people digest the data and understand whether this is a pause or not. We would still look -- we delivered $4.3 billion of NII growth in 2018. We will still benefit in 2019 from the annualization effects of the higher rates we’ve already had as well as solid growth. So, while you kind of expect 2019 over ‘18 to be at that level, it would still be strong NII growth year-on-year.
Jamie Dimon
I would say why it’s equally if not more important than it was. So, if it is a pause because you are going to recession, you’re going to do trades that obviously is very different than it’s to pause, economy is strong and they raise rates, you know which one you would choose.
Marianne Lake
And if this were the end of the cycle, it’s not a cycle we’ve ever seen before. So, in that scenario, if terminal Fed run rates 2.5% -- 4.5%, 5%, plus, I think we’ve never seen that movie before but that’s not our central case. And by the way, the house did a research view. We would still need to see incremental hike this year; if not in the first half, in the second.

Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.
Jim Mitchell
Maybe a question on the card business. There has been chatter about sort of pulling back on rewards to kind of focus more on profitability. I guess, how do you think about the strategy in cards right now? And can that -- I think the revenue yield in the card business was up 7 bps to 11.57. Can that go higher from here as you maybe pull back on rewards?
Marianne Lake
Yes. I would say that when we think about the product continuum we have in the contrast, rewards is a very important part of driving engaged relationships with our customers. Customers are very attuned to it and are looking for value in the product. Value and simplicity and ease of use are the three things in the products that we deliver. So, for us, engage relationships, drive profitability, this is still a very profitable business. So, while we will always make adjustments to our offerings, it’s not the case that we are looking at a meaningful pullback in rewards. And if you think about -- think for example our banking where we are looking to bring the impact of our products together, we are continuing to offer rewards-based incentive to drive engagement with our customers. So, we think it’s a solid strategy of business that already has good returns. It’s fair to say that we’ve seen a lot of competitive response and competitive products in the marketplace that are driving high rewards offerings too and we’ve not seen that lower -- our ability to acquire new accounts. So, we feel great about the value proposition, the simplicity and the compelling products that we have. So, it’s very profitable business.
Jim Mitchell
So, we think about still seeing decent growth, how do we think about card losses specifically this year? You seem pretty optimistic on credit. Should we still expect some seasoning or do you think the macro trends are that positive that we hold steady? How do you think about credit and cards?
Marianne Lake
So, I think the macro trends are definitely positive. So, we are creating tailwinds, but it's also true we talked about the fact that if you go back to 2014-2015 that we had expanded our credit box, we'd expanded it intentionally at higher risk-adjusted margins. But over the course of the last couple of years as we've experienced that performance, we've done sort of surgical risk pullbacks, and we amended our collection strategy, all of which have led to a charge-off rate for the fourth quarter in ‘18 that's down slightly year-on-year and for the year that's a 310 basis points which is reasonably meaningfully below our expectations, even as late as the end of last year. So, we feel great that that kind of loss trends at that 310, maybe a little bit higher is something we should look forward to at least into 2019. And it will be helped by a supportive macro environment.

And we are seeing, if you unpick all of our trends, you see the phenomenon of three vintages. You see the mature vintages that continue to be stable to grinding lower in terms of delinquencies and loss rates. You see the older expansion vintages that have crossed peak delinquencies and are trending to a more stable level. And then you do have, obviously with new acquisitions, cohorts that are still seasoning. That will continue. But, net-net, we're expecting relatively stable loss rate that levels similar to 2018.

Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. I'm sorry, his line has disconnected. Our next question is from John McDonald of Bernstein.
John McDonald
Hi. Good morning. Just wondering on the markets commentary, obviously super early in the quarter, but you mentioned things feeling better. Can you just talk about seasonality there but also just what feels better so far? And then, also in the fourth quarter, what you saw in leverage lending market, how much do you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and the hung deals? Little bit of color there would be helpful.
Marianne Lake
Sure. Okay. So, I would say that obviously the fourth quarter was challenging and there was a lot of market moves, a big sort of broad set of. And at that point, there were elevated concerns around trade, global growth data was causing concerns, there were concerns that the Fed was going to continue to be hawkish and not necessarily as responsive to some of the things the market was worried about. So, there was a lot of negativity, we think too much negativity priced into the fourth quarter. And it started to change a bit when we saw the first really strong unemployment trend which reminded people that there's a very long distance between 3% growth and a contraction. So, yes, we could see slower growth but still growth in the U.S. and across the globe, a slightly more constructive narrative on trade and that continues to broadly progress we hope and believe in a positive direction, and a more dovish outlook from the Fed that potential for that to be pauses in rates or being relatively supportive. And the fact that a lot of people were on the sidelines through the fourth quarter and investor appetite is out there for good value where it can be found.
So, I would say just early days in the first quarter. There are still obviously risks to the outlook. And any of those things could go the worse direction. But so far, things are just a little bit more positive and that's constructive. And therefore you would hope to see normal seasonal strength in January.
On leveraged loans, sort of just diving into the sort of potential for that to be hung bridges, it’s true that there was a significant market correction with spreads widening across high yield bonds and leveraged loans in the fourth quarter. Clearly, stepping back, while the industry -- leveraged finance commitments are -- they are materially down from before the crisis and very different. So, credit fundamentals look pretty good. Having said that -- and by the way, we passed on a lot of deals in the fourth quarter. We've maintained sort of our sort of protection in terms of flex pricing and flex protection. And as a result, the more maturity of our bridge that has -- still got decent cushion. That’s not to say that there's no deal that has the potential for there to be net losses after fee, but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter. I would also say that coming back to the first quarter that actually the market could be quite constructive to fixed income into the third quarter, given a more dovish Fed supporting corporate margin, corporate default rates are going to stay pretty low and we do have time. So, none of the deals that we have need to be brought to market in a hurry, and the market is moving in a positive direction.

Our next question is from Al Alevizakos of HSBC.
Al Alevizakos
Thank you for taking my question. I again want to focus a bit on the market's performance. You pretty much mentioned like weakness across the board in credit, in FX, in rates, which I assume like is the case. First of all, I want bit of an outlook on how you think rates will perform now that volatility has picked up. And more importantly, you mentioned strength in emerging markets. Can I ask whether that was primarily in Asia or LatAm? Thank you very much.
Marianne Lake
So, it’s no good of a conserve talking about how we think things are going to pan out in time in the first quarter other than just the general comment I’ve already made, which is the environment should be more constructive and we’re expecting decent volatility in client activity and we will see how that pans out. With respect to emerging markets, Latin America was a big piece but Asia too.

Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.
Mike Mayo
I guess, I’m a little torn between the year and the quarter. So, I’ll just ask it to Jamie. Jamie, it seems like you guys are very happy with the year with all the record revenues and earnings. But, the fourth quarter, are you happy with the fourth quarter, given expenses, credit, fees?
Jamie Dimon
I’m fully happy with it. The franchise is strong, we’re investing in new products and services, but we’re not immune from the weather and volumes and volatility. We’re not immune from market prices and assets going up and down. And I like the loans up 6%, assets up, long-term flows up. I like the fact that credit card spend is up 10%, merchant processing is up 17%. Shares -- in almost every business, market shares have gone up. That’s what I look at. I really don’t pay that much attention to speed bump it a little bit but the fact that volumes were low in the last three weeks of December. I honestly could care less. I look at more in equities. We’ve gained share and we’re now bumping up to number one. Those folks have done a great job, of course cash, derivatives, prime broker et cetera. And fixed income has maintained our share and we’re adding products and services around the world. And we don’t know it’s going to happen next quarter and I don’t care.
Marianne Lake
And we take the same division, we had strong first half of the year and we said long may it continue but it may not and one quarter doesn’t make a trend. And so, we don’t really react to the sort of micro, even though it was driven by the macro. The really underlying business drivers continue to be strong. And even in those businesses, we are holding leadership positions and gaining share. And so, this too will cost and things will continue to move forward in a constructive manner.
Mike Mayo
As a follow-up, let’s talk about the weather. So, the weather is lousy at the end of the year and Jamie you were just appointed to your third year as Chairman of the Business Roundtable. So, in that role, what are you doing to help JPMorgan and I guess the other banks in terms of China, the government shutdown, immigration, some of these headline issues that Marianne talked about, having hurt the CIB in the fourth quarter?
Jamie Dimon
Yes. So, December is terrible but if you look at January, you have half of it back, generally in spreads and markets and stuff like that. And as BRT, I don’t do anything that benefits JPMorgan. That’s about public policy, that’s good for growth of America in total, and so very specifically stayed away from doing about banks there. But the BRT does take up trade and we are supportive of the fact there are serious issues with China. We would like to see the trade deal get done. It looks like to us they are marching along at least to this March 1st deadline date that enough will be done to kind of get an extension and hopefully complete the deal. We would like to see immigration reform, so proper border security, allowing people who have advance degrees to stay here, having the doctors stay here, having more merit-based immigration and having some path to citizenship. That is the BRT position. We want more innovation. We’d like to reduce regulations at the local and federal level that stop small business formation. So, if you look at the BRT, there are 10 verticals around that -- and we try to do things that are good for the growth of America. 

And bad policy can slow down the growth of America. I have pointed out over and over it takes 12 years to get the permits to build the bridge. And it took eight years to put a man on the moon. It is time that we reform ourselves and not blame anybody else for own lack of that we don't have kids getting at school of educations where they get jobs, the innovation has slowdown, the government R&D spending is down. I always think what can you do better and there is plenty in this country to do better to help growth over the long run. And it’s not about helping it next quarter.

Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.
Glenn Schorr
Follow-up on John’s question earlier on leverage lending. On slide 24, you see the balance on loans held for sale go from like $6.5 billion to $15 billion. I heard your comments on marks. I'm assuming that that is just disruption and you go back towards your normal level that's in the pipes and progress, but I just want to make sure that I'm not making that wrong assumption.
Marianne Lake
Yes. We are not expecting anything to be elevated.
Glenn Schorr
Okay, cool. And…
Jamie Dimon
That number goes up or down over time just based on episodic -- what is cleared out of the books. There is nothing in our number we are afraid of.
Glenn Schorr
Understood. Curious on the credit on the couple of marks and C&I, I'm just curious on how much of that is internal versus external rating agency. And I guess, it's a feel for the underlying fundamentals. How do you know we should treat that as idiosyncratic as you go?
Marianne Lake
So, it’s internal and it’s like lines, sectors. We know the specifics, it is situationally specific. Remember, just to give you some context, while those can drive the dollar value, regular way in any quarter given the size of our portfolio, we might downgrade and upgrade hundreds of individual names based upon the circumstances. So, when we say that we are looking at it and saying that things are idiosyncratic, it’s not just looking at the five situations that drive the biggest sort of value, it’s also looking at the hundreds of downgrades and hundreds of upgrades and seeing if there is any trends or net worrying concern, and honestly not now. Then, so if anything, marginally, we had more upgrades but it’s just -- there is nothing to see right now in our portfolios and we are looking.
Jamie Dimon
We look for reasons to put up reserves, not to take them down.
Marianne Lake
We are more paranoid than you are.
Glenn Schorr
Last one, obviously markets all went down in the fourth quarter and we had some freeze-ups if you will in high yield first time in like 10 years. But, I'm curious how you all think the markets functioned in general? In other words, things went down, spreads widened out, there was lots of fear but it felt like the plumbing was working. But, I don't want to put words in your mouth.
Jamie Dimon
And half the people weren’t even here the last two weeks in December.
Marianne Lake
That’s right. The plumbing was working; we didn’t see any sort of technology issues; we didn’t see any volumes that can be coped with. While I said that there was a lack of debt to markets and liquidity, that’s typically the case when you have one way trends in the market and there are people similarly situated. So, I would say they relatively functioned well, but challenging.
Operator
Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Société Générale.
Andrew Lim
I just had a follow-on question from the vesting high yield mark's question. You seem to be getting the impression that there weren’t really much in the way of marks. Is that because you’ve got very strong hedging strategies in place and that the decline in FICC revenues mainly was due to lower volumes?
Jamie Dimon
There were no marks.

Marianne Lake
There were no marks. In our business right now, we have -- for the vast majority, we have good cushion and we expect to be able to a clear and price through market. And anything that even border line, it’s completely not material.
Jamie Dimon
I think there are few marks, if you look at what happened to flex pricing like mid-December when things were the worst, yes, some of these things were very close to the end of their flex pricing. And that means they are very close to have you some kind of mark. Of course, since then, the spreads have come, come back 40%.
Marianne Lake
Right.
Andrew Lim
Interesting, thanks. And then, my follow-up question is that obviously that capital markets had a tough time but you are wholesale lending, the growth has accelerated quite nicely. Do you get the impression that corporates had a general shift to seek borrowing from banks such as yourselves because they were shut out of the market?
Marianne Lake
I mean, there was an uptick at the end of the year, you saw it in the industry data, we saw it in our spot data. For us in fact, it was largely driven by one investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter but there was a little bit of an uptick and a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing and the balance sheet but nothing I would call -- nothing that I would call unusual or a trend. We didn't have to take down things that would otherwise not play in the market.
Operator
The next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
Matt O'Connor
Good morning. I wanted to circle back on the expense flexibility. I think in your base case, you're pretty clear that you're targeting positive operating leverage and moving down the efficiency ratio to the mid-50s. But, what is some of the expense flexibility and where would it come from, if the revenues slide. I think in 2018, you accelerated some technology spend, given tax reform, you've been opening branches. Some of that stuff obviously can't be pulled back, but you always talk about some areas of flexibility. So, maybe what are those? And if you could kind of size or help quantify some of the flexibility you have, that'd be helpful.
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, I would say, first of all that you saw that from 2013 through ‘16, we had a pretty structural expense reduction program associated with simplifying our businesses. So, in terms of the low hanging fruit and things like that, we would say largely that’s been harvested. We are always looking to generate core operating efficiencies so that we can absorb growth. And when we are investing in technology and data, one of the reasons to do it, customer satisfaction, product innovation aside is efficiency. So, we are seeing some of that come through. We’ll continue to drive that down.
Jamie Dimon
But the efficiencies and the investments are all in the number that Marianne gives you when she says up 5%.
Marianne Lake
That’s right. The way I would say it is that we continue to drive for expense discipline. But as long as you feel as we do that the decision criteria that we use to determine the investments we're making which we think are strategically important for long-term growth of the company and the profitability of the company, supporting clients, if those are good decisions for long term growth, while we could obviously make changes, we would not look to do that. And so, marketing expense for example is one area where you would say there's pretty sizeable and immediate flexibility. Nevertheless, when we invest in marketing, we're driving new accounts and engage customers that drive long-term growth. So, we invested through the cycle. We think it sort of differentiates our long term performance and we'd like to continue to do that. 2019 over ‘18, you wouldn't expect to see necessarily the same clip up that you saw last year, we did accelerate investments in ‘18 and so more of the growth will be revenue related but still decent investments as the opportunity is still good to do that.

Matt O'Connor
Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on a sidebar here on the reserve build as we think about credit quality, are we just in the period now where we should assume kind of some reserve build consistent with loan growth each quarter or was this just a quarter where you had a couple of the lumpiness that really drove? I guess what I'm getting at is, last quarter you had modeled -- I guess what I'm getting at is like, it's -- are we at the point where like just a couple of lumpy loans was going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just -- maybe it's a bit unusual still.
Marianne Lake
So, first of all, I'd sort of point out that in the cost base we hopefully continue to grow healthy mid-single-digits, the seasonality. There is seasonality to card balances and losses. And so you typically see reserve builds in the second half of the year. That's what we saw this year and actually a little bit lower year-on-year than last. And in the wholesale space you're going to see some things will be a bit lumpier and episodic given the nature of the loans that we have. I wouldn't necessarily say that we expect to see a trend from significant reserves but we've been factored by recoveries and releases over the course of the last couple of years partly or in large part at least earlier releasing reserves we took on energy when the energy went through the downturn. So, we'll have some downgrades. We might have some releases. I would, net-net, think that as we grow, we would build but not this proportionally. We’re obviously at a best point in the cycle. So, Jamie mentioned it earlier, to the degree that we have the flexibility, we’re making sure that we are reserved accordingly.
Operator
Our next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.
Saul Martinez
A lot of talk on macroeconomics and the policy backdrop in volatile markets, but as you mentioned earlier, you guys are in a pretty unique position and that you have pretty consistent dialogue with a lot of economic agents whether it’s corporate, governments, institutional investors and whatnot. But just a sense of what your clients are saying, what are they concerned about? Is there any concern on your part that some of these issues have sort of a self-fulfilling effect and that it does end up leading to actions that precipitate a downturn or recession?
Marianne Lake
I think that we would look to the sort of macroeconomic data, which is still generally supportive and so I think should be good. But for sure, investments is not immune to external factors. And so manufacturing data has been a little weaker I would say. CapEx is sluggish on sales around global growth. Government shutdown and trade are not particularly help, uncertainty is not good to anyone. So, there is no doubt that as things continue, if there is a level of anxiety and uncertainty, it’s just not constructive for confidence and confidence that gets stronger or less strong market. I wouldn’t say that I think it’s clear and present. But I think we should be extremely careful because sentiment particularly consumer sentiment will be incredible important. And right now it’s good, sentiment in consumer and we just got back some sentiment from I hope small middle market companies that while not at their high, but still very high.
Saul Martinez
That's helpful. If I could just ask about loan growth and is it just a more-broad question about your ability to continue to outpace the industry? And I suspect we’ll get more color at Investor Day but just want to get your sense of the sustainability of growth and you mentioned on the commercial side, you maybe scale back a little bit, maybe we’re late cycle. But, where do you feel like you can continue to outgrow the industry, where do you feel like maybe it's time to scale back on risk a little bit?

Marianne Lake
So, I think it’s -- and incredibly nuance question, because in general, home lending has a challenging market backdrop. For us, it’s tale of two cities. We’re doing quite well and gaining a bit of share in the kind of retail purchase market. And we’re holding the pricing discipline corresponding and leading share there. So, there is a challenging market backdrop, card was doing well at and it’s sort factor of all things we talked about, investments in digital product, rewards all of the above. So, we would like to believe that we will continue to hold our own there. And auto is extremely competitive. We play in prime, super prime space. And we’re seeing competition from people who have different economic drivers in our sight, credit unions and captives. And so, we’re willing to lose share to maintain returns there.
You bifurcate C&I, we’re growing in line, we’re best in the industry in our expansion markets where we’ve been making the investments, where we’ve been adding specialized industry coverage. And we would like to see that because of the investments we’re making. But in mature markets we’re again being pretty prudent. I won’t call it tightening but being very selective. And commercial real estate, particularly construction lending, yes, we’re tightening. We’re being very cautious about new deals and selective about it. So, it isn’t the case anymore that we would say we’re seeking to grow, although we ever were, loan growth is an outcome of number of factors, mainly the strategic dialog with our companies but also the environment we’re in and it’s extremely nuance. And in many of our businesses, we’re going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point.
Jamie Dimon
So, maybe I’ll just reemphasize that. We tell our management that we have no problem seeing loans books shrink. We’re not going to be sitting here ever in our live to say and you got to grow the loan book, you got to show loan growth. Remember, Warren Buffett used to say in the insurance business and sometime it’s true in the loan business, you’re better off the sales force go play golf than there to make new loans. We’re not going to be stupid. And the other thing you have to always keep in mind, it’s not the loan, it’s the relationships you look at in total. So, when it comes to middle market or all these other things are reasons that we stay in a business knowing there is going to be a cycle and we are not going to be children on this cycle. We know that losses are going to go up.
Operator
Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
Betsy Graseck
Hi. Good morning. Are we playing golf all day yet or is that still far away?
Jamie Dimon
Credit is pristine, mortgage credit is pristine, middle market is pristine. Underwriting has been pretty good other than a few little pockets that Marianne has mentioned. We saw people stretching in auto, we saw some stretching in -- and we’re not going to self fund credit card, but little bit people are stretching in that. And leverage lending, we’re not worried about all loan book. I think you can have a logical conversation. But there is kind of a nonbank loan book. But that’s not our concern. And it is what it is at the time…
Marianne Lake
And I think where businesses are notably a little bit less relationship driven. So, think about kind of no new relationship, commercial term lending real estate banking, mortgage to a lesser degree also. We are seeing -- we are losing or seeking share where it makes sense to do it.
Jamie Dimon
Yes. And competition, we mentioned this before, it’s back everywhere, and that’s a good thing for America. And that means the pricing is little tough and you have compete.
Betsy Graseck
Yes. So, we are still off the golf course, all right. That’s good. Just wanted to understand a little bit more on the expense side. I know it was -- even with the weather, you guys put out a 14% ROTCE, which is obviously best-in-class. The question is on the expenses, there is flexibility there but yet I know you’ve guided to up single digits in 1Q ‘19. Based on the prior conversation, it seems like 1Q might be in aberration of mid single digits or should I take that that’s kind of the run rate you are expecting for the full year? So, why would 1Q be a little bit different I guess is really the question?

Marianne Lake
Yes. So, I wouldn’t fully annualize the first quarter. But think about we’ve added bankers and advisors across our businesses. So, you’re going to get annualization impact, particularly first quarter to first quarter. We have added more and more as the year progressed. Similarly, something like auto lease where we grew our auto lease business, revenues and expenses strongly in 2018 and that will be in our run rate in the first quarter. So, front office, auto lease, some of the technology investments we have making, the annualization of those will be more pronounced first quarter to first quarter than fourth quarter to fourth quarter because many of them are in our run rate in the fourth quarter. And then outside of that there is a bit more in real estate as we sort of execute on our head office strategy. And then marketing, foundation completion, those things -- there is going to be timing. So, the first quarter will be higher. I wouldn’t annualize it. We are going to see nicely growth year-over-year much more because of revenue growth than the corporate investment of both year-on-year, not the same level as last year. And we will obviously give you a lot more detail and insights and thoughts on ranges and everything at Investor Day clearly.
Operator
Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.
Brian Kleinhanzl
Just a quick question on the balance sheet; I’m if you gave us already. But just walk through the idea of lowering down the deposit with banks and kind of moving into repo, what you saw in the quarter and then kind of is that just something that was temporary, that’s expected to reverse in the first quarter?
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, it’s fair to say that money market rates traded above IOER throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter. And so through the quarter and that year-end, we will able to take advantage of the market opportunity to move out of cash into cash alternatives, things, reverse repos and short duration assets. And so, for us, it was yield-enhancing opportunity to redeploy cash and a mix change rather than adding duration. And that continues to be the case into the first quarter. It contributed to our NIM expansion in fourth quarter. We continue to have a bit of that mix shift in the first quarter and it’s a market opportunity.
Brian Kleinhanzl
And then, a separate question on, I know it’s not a big revenue driver anymore but within mortgage banking, you had a negative gain on sale in the quarter. Could you just give us some color there, what drove a negative gain on sale?
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, in the quarter, and as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet, we actually did a sale of conforming loans to GSE of about $5 billion. And the impact of that was perhaps a loss on the sale of the portfolio, given that they'd been originated at lower rates. So, as rates are higher, the fair value of the loan is lower. Against that, if you were to look at the rest of the P&L, you'll see a benefit in net interest income because the interest rate risk of that has been transferred to the Treasury Department. So, it's geography, it's a loss on the sale of a portfolio against which there's funding breakage in NII. Just so that you know, when we -- our mortgage loan with RWA 50% versus security at 20% with better liquidity value, we did reinvest some of those proceeds in mortgage-backed securities in treasury. So, we will earn that back over time, net for the company.
Operator
Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.
Steven Chubak
Hey, good morning. So, I wanted to start with just a bigger picture question on credit and the impact of normalization. Certainly, the near-term guidance sounds quite encouraging. Jamie, you did make a comment recently at investor conference talking about how the banking industry is over-earning on credit, not particularly a controversial remark. But in the past, you guided to a medium-term loss rate blended basis of roughly 65 bps. That does contemplate continued loan losses in commercial. And just given that we’re late cycle, I was hoping you can maybe speak to your expectation for what a normalized credit loss rate is for JPMorgan, given your current mix and where that might differ from your medium-term loss guidance?

Jamie Dimon
So, we're not talking quarter-over-quarter, we’re just taking in general trends…
Steven Chubak
I'm talking in bigger picture.
Jamie Dimon
So, Marianne has shown year-to-year we consider it normalized losses. And for years, we've been doing better than that. In credit card, middle market, large corporate, mortgage has come back down to a very low number. And at one point, it's going to go up. And so, I'm not -- we're not telling you what's going to happen next quarter. Right now, it looks like it’s kind of steady state. But at one point we will not be surprised see it go up. I don't know if it could be second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, and I don't know if we’re relate cycle. We don't exactly know where we're in the cycle. And so, we just won’t be surprised to see it go up. And the number -- if we look at it by product, we're looking at a total that can actually -- may vary against the total.
Marianne Lake
I think, I hate to say this because I know that you don't want to wait a few weeks but we'll have a more complete conversation about kind of range of total outcomes on credit at Investor Day but we -- when we gave our medium-term simulation we said listen, we did a 17 return on tangible common equity in 2018 and our medium-term guidance is for 17%. We under earned against our guidance in other parts of the cycle. Maybe we’ll over-earn against it. But NII and repo bags are higher and credit is benign. And at some point, we would expect both of those things to normalize but we would continue to see solid growth in all of our drivers. So, we don't know when it will be and actually don't see anything that -- I know you say in the second, third or fourth quarter. There's no indication that it's in any of those quarters. But, we'll have a more comprehensive discussion at Investor Day about range of total outcomes.
Steven Chubak
We're looking forward to that. And just one follow-up for me on the IB outlook, Marianne, I was hoping I could unpack to some of your comments around the -- how the IB backlog. You cited that as being quite strong. But just looking at the individual businesses for M&A, ECM, DCM, especially given some the economic pressures outside the U.S. what informs your outlook across each of those?
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, I would say that first of all, we did see, given the conditions in the fourth quarter, a number of deals that got pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, particularly in ECM and DCM, in M&A there was a bit more balance so every deal that got pushed or stopped, there were more that came to take its place. But as a result as we go into the first quarter, pipelines across the board are elevated relative to last year and pretty strong. And at the end of the day, we talked about earlier, confidence is still high, companies are still motivated to drive growth. And so, the environment should be constructive for continued M&A. Technology, healthcare, biotech innovation, technology innovation, momentum in ECM that we've been benefiting from and the IPO pipeline should continue market dependent. And notwithstanding December, actually a sort of lower outlook for rates in the U.S., should broadly be a tailwind for fixed income in the first quarter, the first half. So, the second half of the year, I think is going to be determined by how things shape up over the next several months. But looking into January, again, if the market remains generally constructive, we should see tailwinds across the businesses.
Jamie Dimon
I think potential backlogs, generally, you want them high because that’s good, but they’re all like an accordion, too, they come and go. So, that’s not a forecast for the future that you’d definitely get those revenues. They could get delayed, particularly things like IPO that you’ve already seen. I just want to point out, the shout out to the folks in the investment bank, our market share went up in Europe, Asia, Latin America and United States last year. That’s what we really look at when we look at the business.

Marianne Lake
60 basis points full-year.
Jamie Dimon
60 basis points all year. And first time ever, it went in all four major in markets. 
Operator
Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.
Marty Mosby
Jamie, I was glad that you mentioned that we don't know the red end of the cycle because that's kind of just assume because of that lapse of time, but not really the economic factors. And then the other piece of this is, when you look at losses, they tend to be good until they go into recession. Then, they are bad. There is no just kind of normalization. So, the question about a normal rate of loss that we really have two dichotomous answers. We have a good answer, which is when we’re expanding and the economy is stable, and we have a bad answer or recession. It's kind of one or the other. Just want to see what you thought about that.
Jamie Dimon
You’re exactly right. At one point you’re going to over and at one point you’re going to under run. And we try to -- when we look at the business, we kind of try to price through that. So, we’re trying to earn fair returns through the cycle. And I totally agree with you. We know it’s going to -- they are going to change at one point. And we try to do a better job underwriting too but we do work hard and make sure we underwrite other people as best we can.
Marty Mosby
Which then limits the volatility when you go into that bad period, which is what you want to do. You underwrite to make sure you're defending against that cycle.
Jamie Dimon
Exactly, and the other one you have is the reserves. You put them up, you take them down. So, our total reserve is what 14 billion? But at one point they were 30. So, we went from -- in the great recession, went from 7 to 30 back to 14. And I call it income paper. It doesn’t mean advantages, but when you go into that recession, your losses go up, any reserves have to go up. And we’re completely aware of that.
Marianne Lake
Although I think we have to say, for obvious reason, that we wouldn’t expect any near-term recession if there is one to anything like it did before. And even if it did, given the credit quality of the portfolio, performance will be not only absolutely better but we think strong on a relative basis.
Jamie Dimon
Other than -- if you look at the consumer, that $13 trillion that's outstanding, other than student, which is fundamentally owned by the government, the more stuff that's been written is prime. So, back to $10 trillion, it is much better than what it was in ‘07. And I think credit card, I forgot the exact numbers, much more prime than was in ‘07. I think order is about the same but order actually outperformed, more prime and outperformed in the great recession. I think people in general have done a better job underwriting middle market and leveraged up than it did last time. I think if you start a recession soon, going into it, the credit portfolio is much stronger than last time.
Marty Mosby
And the follow-up question to that is, we talked about auto and some of those other places where you saw some of that deterioration, what our model showing is that actually the discipline and the reaction time to that deterioration is much quicker than when we saw the one to four family cycled the last time where you saw deterioration but growth just kept going. We had so many banks jump in and say, look, we’ve already pulled back on auto lending, we pulled back on multifamily. There have already been places where you’ve seen that discipline. So that discipline in itself put the governor on economic growth, which is why we're having less growth or slower growth but yet it also creates a like you said, a stronger portfolio for that eventual downturn.
Jamie Dimon
I agree with that. Lack of discipline we see is in student and a little bit in small commercial real estate.

Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
Gerard Cassidy
Can you guys -- there has been a lot of talk about leveraged loans and how this time around everything seems to be underwritten better. Are there any tangible statistics that you can share with us or maybe on Investor Day you might do show us that yes the leveraged loan portfolio for you guys in particular is much healthier than maybe ‘06-‘07? And then, second, on this leverage loan issue, outside the banking industry, what are some of the indirect hits that you and maybe some of your peers may experience, none from the direct hit of the leverage loan but for some of the craziness that's going on outside the banking industry?
Jamie Dimon
Yes. So, can I just give a big picture of this? I think $1.7 trillion of leveraged loans, okay. So, term A is about half of that. These are very rough numbers, okay, most of it with banks, and obviously safer than term B. A big chunk, over I think 60% or 70% of the term B is with nonbanks. And so, if you look at your at banking system, if you look at the leverage lending bridge book in ‘07, it was over $400 billion; today's it’s number like 80. In ‘07, there were commitments and no flex and everyone has plenty of flex now. So, we look at covenants, so it’s kind of covenants but there’s flex and there is a whole bunch of stuff in there. So, it is far, far, far sounder today. Even these CLOs, you look to underwrite the CLOs, they are far better underwritten with more equity, more sub debt and more mezzanine stuff like that.
And go to shadow banks, they do things like differently. A lot of those folks are quite bright, they know what they're doing. Someone is going to get hurt there. And the issue there is in the next recession because the -- and remember, most of the major banks don’t fund a lot of that. We aren’t taking huge indirect exposure to that by funding some of the nonbanks. And I think the issue there is for the marketplace it’s going to be -- when you have a recession, the lender will not be there. So, a lot of these borrowers will be stranded. So, that’s not -- that’s an opportunity or risk or something like that but it’s not -- I wouldn’t put it in the systemic category.
Again, if you go back to ‘07, we -- it emerged in ‘07 there was $1 trillion of bad mortgages that were kind of all over the place, the CLOs, SIBs. There are no SIBs. The CLOs are much smaller. The leverage lending book is much smaller book. Capital liquidity is much higher. So, it is nothing like ‘07. You will have a recession, it just won’t be like you had last time affecting the banking system. It will affect the banking system. We are little bit canaries in the coal mine. We are not immune to what goes in the economy. But it won’t be anything like you saw last time for most of the larger banks.
Gerard Cassidy
No. I agree with that. And do you think Janet Yellen and other Federal Reserve officials comments about leveraged lending is more directed to the exposure outside the banking industry than inside the banking industry?
Jamie Dimon
Yes, I do.
Marianne Lake
Yes.
Jamie Dimon
Yes. Again, I don’t think they were saying it’s huge and systemic. They’re saying it’s something that you should keep an eye on. I think that the regulatory do keep an eye on that.
Gerard Cassidy
And then just to pivot on deposit question. Obviously, noninterest bearing deposits are tough to keep as rates are going higher. Can you guys give us some color on the non-interest-bearing deposits? There is obviously a small decline. What parts of the business you're seeing there, and the Fed’s unwind of its balance sheet, how much of an impact do you think that might be having on the non-interest-bearing deposits?
Marianne Lake
So, the migration into product from noninterest to interest bearing is predominantly or largely exclusively a wholesale thing. At this point there is not enough rate benefit in the interest bearing savings to drive into product migration, definitely some growth outlook in CDs given pricing, but it’s wholesale right now and it’s mainly rate-related and not balance sheet in terms of the Fed unwind.

Jamie Dimon
Can I just make a comment about interest rates and the balance sheet of Fed? So, the interest rate is one thing but the balance sheet of Fed obviously is causing changes in the flow of funds. It’s causing changes in that banks now have options other than reserves at the central bank because the two-year and three-year bond yields for corporate -- government bond is much higher, some people are preferring to own that because they think it would be paid better than corporate risk. So, changing the whole bunch of fund flows concerns people, but I’d say it’s part and process of normalization.
Operator
Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
Ken Usdin
There were couple of Fed or regulatory documents out in late December, one is codifying the three-year burning of stated seasonal impacts and another one where they are pushing out till ‘22 on their own implementation of CECL accounting in the supervisory stress test. I was just wondering, just any takeaways you had from reading that and any hopes you might have for just as we get toward some finalization of which way CECL goes and how it looks, aspirations around that and how that interacts with CCAR and such?
Jamie Dimon
Before Marianne answers that question, I just want to do a shout out to Jefferies because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group, and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year.
Ken Usdin
I’ll pass that along, Jamie.
Marianne Lake
Following that -- it’s hard to follow, I would say that we've been pretty clear about the fact that our biggest concern around CECL was properly understanding not just for us but regulators to properly understand the implications for capital, not only in benign but in stressed scenarios, and what the implications of the outcomes that it could have on the willingness of people to extend credit, particularly as cycles age and with the outlook for volatilities to increase. So, having a transition is obviously helpful. You should imagine that we would likely avail ourselves of that opportunity. That is what it is. For me, the question that needs to be clarified is if we are to include the impact of CECL in company run stress test, but the Federal Reserve is not going to include it in the stress test, we need to kind of understand the insight between those two things, particularly if that might coincide with a turn in the cycle in actual fact.
So, I think we're looking for continued clarity from the regulators about what exactly that means. If we're embedding these assumptions into our stress tests and our results sooner than they are, how do we think about the implications of that on our distribution plans and capital outlooks. And you know importantly if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans I do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics, secular change, that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential business. And we should worry about that.
Jamie Dimon
It'll be a big number for like credit card. So, if you put 3% now on when you build the loan book by $100, the number would be 6%. Some number in the future will be much higher. So, I do think particularly smaller banks will react fairly dramatically how they run their loan books through that.
Marianne Lake
So, our view is that more on that needs to be done in the industry about what this looks like. I hope that what was meant by we should include it in company run stress test is for us to collectively learn and for the regulators to have the time to respond to that. But remember, 2022, considering all the discussion we've had on this call about the cycle, how long the cycle is, when there's a turn in the cycle, and we could actually face a stress before that. And so it's great that they are waiting a bit, but it might all be a bit of an academic point depending on what happens actually.

Ken Usdin
Yes. That's a fair point. And Jamie you've also said in the past that you guys lend on accounting -- don't lend on accounting and lend on economic, but there's this kind of challenge to that that Marianne just mentioned about the unintended consequences. And so, it would be interesting to see that if there is in fact the point where banks don't lean in as you just mentioned, Marianne.
Jamie Dimon
They will change.
Marianne Lake
Yes. And we have the luxury or the flexibility of being able to say that we can continue to lend based upon the underlying economics but someone who has a differently situated balance sheet and return profile may not be able to do that.
Ken Usdin
Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator
Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.
Mike Mayo
A follow-up on the net interest margin, two sides to the question, one is commercial loan pricing. I guess, it's been kind of brutal you’ve had the BDCs, private equity firms, loan funds all computing. Has there been any let up with some of the dislocation the capital markets late in the year. And the other side, retail deposit betas, Marianne, you thought they would get a lot worse. I don't think it's been as bad as you thought. What was your retail deposit beta and what do you still expect?
Jamie Dimon
Before Marianne answers that can I just go back to the cyclical stuff? It's not just CECL a lot of things that have been built and since the crisis were really good, there was more pro-cyclicality built into it. And so you're going to see the next downturn that we have a far more pro-cyclical accounting, liquidity and rules, and rules capital and stuff like that, which we don't know the full effect of that. But if I was a regulator, I would be very cautious about constantly building pro-cyclicality into the system. And I gave you the example, it's our loan books, they're going from 7 to 30 or whatever they went to back to 14. It will affect how people respond to in the downturns. And it will cause people to pullback much quicker than maybe in the past in total.
Marianne Lake
Okay. So, just on your question, so corporate loan spreads, I would say, we did see sort of pretty brutal grinding down in corporate spread. But over the last actually couple of quarters, we saw them find a bit of an equilibrium and stabilize at levels. So, while, I would say it’s still true to say that there is a lot of competition, at least in the space in which we’re operating we’re seeing spread at relatively stable levels in the corporate space. And honestly I don’t remember saying that I thought we would see an acceleration that was dramatic in retail betas in the short-term. Obviously at some point when the when we have this level of rates and the spread between market rates and rates paid get to a certain level and if normalization continues, we would expect to see repo flags catch up. But, we have not seen that yet outside of CDs in retail phase right now.
Mike Mayo
And the way you calculate it, what was your retail deposit beta this quarter and how does that compare to the past?
Marianne Lake
So, in checking and savings and lead savings, it’s nothing. In CDs, it’s something but around to a very small number.
Operator
Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
Gerard Cassidy 
Just a quick follow-up, Marianne. Have your investment bankers on the front lines passed on any concerns about the government shutdown? There is reports that the SEC is not open. And is that slowing down the investment banking business and your thoughts on that?
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, I would say that we’ve been -- we benefited from the fact that year-end and into the early part of January and holiday season have a light calendar, typically in January for IPOs in particular. But for sure, if we don’t see the ability to get approvals from SEC on IPOs and to a lesser extent some of the M&A deals that need approvals from government agencies, it will be problematic in the ability to see those activity levels play out and fees be realized. So, it’s one of many things that would behoove us to end this sooner rather than later.

Operator
And we have no further questions at this time.
Jamie Dimon

Now, I would like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street.
Ilene Fiszel Bieler
Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley will speak first, then Eric Aboaf, our CFO will take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today’s presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one-on-one items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation.
In addition, today’s presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.
With that, let me turn it over to Ron.
Ron O'Hanley
Good morning, everyone. As you know, this is my first opportunity to address you since becoming State Street’s CEO at the start of 2019. 
Let me turn to slide 3. We announced our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results this morning and I want to start by providing some context in terms of the overall environment, addressing our performance and then importantly, focus the bulk of my comments outlining what we’re going to do differently going forward. Market dynamics are changing for our clients. The shift from active to passive means thinner fees as well as more competition amongst managers who are increasingly challenged to outperform their peers and consequently face lower volumes and thinner fees themselves. 
The resulting margin compression for investment managers has led them to increase pressure on their providers. Asset owners, facing inadequate returns, are similarly pressuring providers to do more for less. In turn, these same clients need better technology and streamlined operations to increase their ability to generate alpha more efficiently and reduce operating costs. 
Given these headwinds for our clients, we are adapting strategically to become increasingly more competitive, offer greater functionality and be the essential partner to our clients. I have made it clear to my colleagues at State Street and want to make it clear to you, we want to better drive our own destiny and more effectively manage our exposure to market headwinds. That means change, real change that I will talk about today and in the year ahead. Year-over-year, our revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong performance in net interest income and FX trading as well as the contribution from the recently acquired Charles River development business. 

We are encouraged by the continued interest we are seeing in CRD with a total of 98 client engagements since announcing the deal. These positive trends were offset by unfavorable market conditions, including the significantly down markets during the fourth quarter and ongoing fee compression, which impacted our servicing fee revenues. Assets under custody and administration decreased quarter-over-quarter, reflecting lower equity market levels and client transitions. Fourth quarter new servicing business wins were 140 billion. 
Additionally, at quarter end, AUCA yet to be installed totaled approximately 385 billion. At 1.9 trillion for the full year of 2018, we experienced a record level of new servicing wins. State Street Global Advisors was also impacted by the market environment as our business has a disproportionate exposure to equity markets and other risk on asset classes, such as high yield. Assets under management decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by weaker equity markets as well as institutional and cash outflows, partially offset by ETF net inflows. 
While SSGA results are not yet where we would like them to be, we have been working to diversify our business mix, leverage relationships across State Street and fill in offerings as we take advantage of the shift from products to solutions. These offerings include asset allocation, exposure management and outsourced CIO as well as demand for a range of ETF products. For example, this quarter, we saw good organic growth in our European ETFs and our low cost US ETFs and remain confident that our strategy of targeted growth in areas such as ETFs, OCIO and other multi asset solutions and ESG, just to name a few, will drive future growth.
Regarding our overall bottom line performance simply put, we need to and can do better. That means reigniting servicing fee growth in a sustainable way, reducing costs across our organization and building upon the advances that we have made in digitization and automation. Collectively, this means being faster and smarter about how we deliver solutions that solve our client's greatest challenges. Our capital position is strong. Moreover, we are optimistic the balance sheet repositioning actions completed during 2018 better position us for the 2019 CCAR cycle, supporting stronger levels of capital return for our shareholders.
In light of our recent results and ongoing industry dynamics, we are taking immediate action on expenses to ensure that we become a more efficient organization for our clients and shareholders alike. I have implemented a firm wide hiring freeze for all non-critical roles. We are rolling out a rigorous new performance management system and are structurally compressing and reducing the senior management pyramid by 15%, while improving spans and reducing layers across the bank by 25% to create a more agile and accountable organization. 
These actions are enabled by the beacon work and the consolidation of work into our global hubs. Thus, we are confident in our ability to execute quickly. In fact, initial reductions have already occurred. Additionally, we are focused on addressing inefficiencies across our entire expense base and have launched a new cost savings program that will continue through 2019 to reduce structural expenses, while also enabling us to invest in the business appropriately. As part of that program, which Eric will cover shortly, we recorded a 223 million pretax repositioning charge, the benefits from which we expect to fully realize within 12 to 15 months.
Let me turn to slide 4. Slide 4 outlines my vision for State Street. We intend to be the leading asset servicer, asset manager and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world’s capital. This vision will be driven by five strategic priorities. 

One, we will increase core fee growth by becoming an essential partner to our clients, gaining share of wallet and building enduring institutional relationships. The issues faced by our clients have moved services, technology and operations to the C suite agenda. Thus, we are upgrading our client coverage model to meet these needs. These changes, including new senior leadership, are already underway.
Two, we must deploy the industry's leading front to back asset servicing platform as a technology driven scale provider. Three, we will continue to innovate to grow diversified revenue streams, including new markets and NII opportunities. Four, we must generate structural expense saves by automating key processes to reduce unit costs and by leveraging our global hubs and scale among other initiatives. And five, become a more high performing organization through flattening our structure, increasing the speed of decision making and evolving our employees’ skill base around our technology and data priorities.
Executing against the strategic vision will require concerted action and select investments, which I'm driving forward across the business. At the same time, we need to do more to improve performance in the short term, which is evidenced by our actions announced today.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.
Eric Aboaf
Thank you, Ron and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and 2018 results, I'd like to take a moment on slide 5 to discuss notable items and how they impacted our financials. In 4Q 18, we recognized 223 million of pretax repositioning costs, consisting of severance and real estate write offs. This charge is in response to the challenging industry conditions and includes the organizational streamlining and de-layering actions that Ron announced last month. I'll have more to say on how we are tackling expenses later in the presentation, including details in our new 350 million expense initiative announced today.
In addition, we also had 24 million of acquisition restructuring costs related primarily to Charles River, which was below our original estimate, 24 million related to the sale of a small alternative servicing business in the Channel Islands and 50 million of legal and related costs. In total, we recognized notable items of 321 million pretax or $0.64 a share.
On page 6, we show our GAAP results in the top two panels as well as our results ex the notable items I just described for those of you who want to see some of our underlying trends. On this basis, we didn't achieve our fee operating leverage goal, but we did deliver a positive operating leverage overall in 2018.
Now, moving to slide 7, 4Q18 EPS of $1.04 was down 44% quarter-on-quarter, but up 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of our 4Q18 repositioning charge and the 4Q17 tax reform costs. For the full year 2018, our GAAP EPS of $6.40 was up 22% over 2017.
Looking at 4Q18, return on equity was down 6.5 percentage points sequentially, primarily related to the quarter's notable expense items. For the full year 2018, ROE was up 1.6 percentage points from full year 2017. Overall, we saw growth in both EPS and ROE on a full year basis, driven by NII growth through active balance sheet management and higher interest rates, FX trading, where we continue to gain share, the acquisition of CRD and lower taxes. We are however disappointed by our performance in several of our fee businesses and I'll describe the drivers and our additional actions on the next few pages. 
Turning to slide 8, our end of period AUCA and AUM levels were significantly impacted by the sharp sell-off in equity markets during the end of the fourth quarter as well as the cumulative effect of industry flows in the past year. As you know and as we have summarized on the right side of this page, global equity markets were down 6% to 17% in 2018, after posting double digit gains in 2017. At the same time, cumulative industry flows were dramatically down after significant inflows during last year and client transaction activity was muted, as investors sat on the sidelines. As a result, we saw AUCA levels fall 7% quarter-on-quarter and 5% year-on-year, while AUM levels fell 11% and 10% respectively.

Moving to slide 9, I want to spend some time unpacking total revenues, which were up 1% quarter-on-quarter and up 5% year-on-year. Servicing fees, shown in the dark blue piece of the stacked bar on the left side of the page were down 4% quarter-on-quarter and 7% year-on-year. Let me give you some color. On both the sequential quarter and year-over-year basis, we had a 2 to 3 point reduction in servicing fees due to falling global equity markets. In addition, we've recently been seeing industry pricing pressure of about 1 percentage point per quarter over the last year. 
The cumulative effect has caused a material year-on-year downdraft in servicing fees. And we also had one previously disclosed client transition, which was worth about 2 percentage points year-on-year, which was offset by net new business and client activity. To put these numbers in context, the long term appreciation in equity markets has typically lifted servicing fees on average by about 2 percentage points annually over the last 5 years. Positive client flows and client transactional activity have added another 2 percentage points annually and net new business has also generated 2 percentage points of annual growth, all of which have been partially offset by typical pricing headwinds of just under 2 percentage points annually. 
This year has been particularly challenging though, since we've seen twice the average historical pricing headwinds. Without the tailwind of market appreciation nor client flows and activity that are inherent in our pricing structure. We have thus undertaken meaningful initiatives to combat these headwinds, such as upgrading our client coverage program and strengthening pricing discipline through our new pricing governance process. And since we need to focus on what we can control, we are even more resolute that we need to actively manage our expense base lower, which I'll discuss further in a few minutes.
Turning to slide 10, let me briefly discuss our other fee revenues. Beginning with management fees, 4Q revenue was up 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by revenue recognition adoption, but down 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower equity markets as well as net outflows in our equity focused institutional business. SSGA continues to focus on expanding our relationships and product categories that offer higher margin. 4Q FX trading services saw continued strong performance, up 19% year-over-year, driven by higher FX volumes and volatility. We continue to differentiate our FX offerings with clients, driven by the breadth and depth of our capabilities. 
4Q securities finance revenues were down 6% quarter-on-quarter and 18% year-on-year, reflecting lower assets on loan and lower spreads as clients de-leverage and industry demand fell. I would note that the business continues to evolve after the CCAR related counterparty adjustments. We've navigated these changes quite smoothly in FX, but continue to work through the effects in agency lending. Finally, we saw a significant step up in processing fees with the addition of CRD for the first time in our fourth quarter financials. We continue to be excited by the acquisition, we're pleased with its performance and remain confident in our previously announced revenue and cost synergies.
As you can see, on the lower right of the slide, CRD saw net new bookings of 14 million for 4Q18. We have announcer our new client advisory board and delivered higher than expected fourth quarter revenues of 121 million on 39 million of expenses. We also incurred 18 million of amortization costs and 24 million of acquisition costs associated with CRD this past quarter. While CRD is enjoying real momentum, I would caution you against simply annualizing these 4Q results, given the lumpiness inherent in the 606 revenue accounting reporting standard.

Now on to slide 11, we saw continued NII growth and NIM expansion during the fourth quarter. Our NII was up 4% quarter-on-quarter due to the Fed hikes we saw in September and December as well as a one-time benefit of approximately 6 million from hedging activities. 4Q NII was up 13% year-on-year, driven by higher US interest rates and discipline liability pricing, while NIM expanded 7 basis points quarter-on-quarter and 17 basis points year-on-year. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our average level deposits remained fairly steady and our betas remained similar to last quarter at just over 50%. We were also pleased to see an increase in our lending activity during the quarter. All of this bodes well for a full year 2019.
Now turning to expenses, as we indicated earlier in the call, we are extraordinarily focused on managing expenses in this challenging revenue environment. I'll start by summarizing our expenses on an underlying basis, excluding notable items in Charles River and then discuss our efforts during 3Q and 4Q to keep our second half expenses flat to the first half on that basis. I'll then summarize the new expense savings program we just announced today.
Beginning on slide 12, you can see that our underlying basis 4Q18 expenses were up 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, driven largely by the year-over-year adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard as well as technology investments. From a line item perspective, and relative to 4Q17, comp and employee benefits were well controlled, increasing just 1%, reflecting technology contractor and annual merit increases, partially offset by beacon savings and lower performance based incentive compensation, given our disappointing results.
Information systems increased reflecting infrastructure enhancements as well as additional investments to support growth. Transaction processing costs were down as we renegotiated sub-custodian savings for a second quarter in a row. Occupancy costs were down as a result of continued progress in optimizing our global footprint.
Now turning the slide 13, as the extent of the challenging revenue conditions became clear last spring, we committed to actually managing our quarterly expenses, so as to keep second half expenses flat to first half on an underlying basis. As you see on the left side of this page, we deliver on this commitment, but we know we need to do more. On the right side of the page, we summarize the progress in our Beacon savings, which totaled 245 million in 2018 as well as additional tactical actions and savings, which included a down payment on our 2019 program. These savings include the start of management de-layering, contracts under savings, the renegotiation of certain sub-custodial relationships and better control of discretionary spending.
Now to slide 14, in light of our current macroeconomic and industry conditions impacting revenues, we have launched a significant new expense savings program. In total, this program is designed to achieve 350 million of in year expense savings during 2019 or approximately 4% of our expense base, which is larger than our previous efforts. On the right side of the page, you'll see the two major categories we've identified, resource discipline and process engineering and automation, with expected savings of approximately 160 million and 190 million respectively.
Resource discipline includes a previously announced 15% reduction in senior management, the rollout of a more rigorous performance management system to better control headcount and further vendor management savings and the continued tackling of our real estate footprint. Process engineering and automation benefits are expected to include the reduction of approximately 6% of our workforce or 1500 roles in high cost locations. Staffing assessments were recently done as part of our shift to a more globalized model and we are now able to take further advantage of automation, and standardized processes and lower cost per person. 

We also intend to streamline three operational hubs and two joint ventures as well as continue the drive towards common technology platforms and the retirement of legacy applications. The initiation of certain portions of this program results in the 4Q repositioning charge that I mentioned, which we described in the left side of the page. Even though this charge is good payback, we know we need to reduce the size of these charges going forward, which is why we've rolled out a new performance management system and headcount control.
Moving to slide 15, our capital ratios ended the year, similar to those of a year ago with tier 1 leverage of 7.2% and a standardized set 1 of 11.5%. We also undertook certain balance sheet and counterparty actions in the fourth quarter to be better positioned for the 2019 CCAR process. As you see on the left side of the page, we shifted the investment portfolio during 4Q to further increase the percentage of HQLA securities and adjusted the held to maturity holdings, thus reducing the associated AOCI volatility to our capital under stress.
This portfolio rebalancing, including turning over about 10% of the book and is not expected to have a negative impact on further NII growth. Lastly and consistent with our previous announcement, we will resume share repurchases this month and intend to repurchase up to 600 million through June 30, 2019.
Turning now to slide 16, I'd like to focus on our 2019 outlook. Before I start though, I'd like to first share some of the assumptions, underlying our current views. At a macro level, we are assuming continued, albeit slowing global growth. Market interest rates forward and only 
a modest uplift from equity markets, but with continued volatility, which will keep investor flows muted and transactional activity light.
I would note that this operating environment is materially worse today than it was just 45 days ago when I presented at the Goldman Conference. Since then, we've seen a significant selloff in equity markets for the year end 2018 with the US equity indices down almost 10% in December versus the first two months of the fourth quarter. This sell off has put a material drag on our quarterly fee revenue run rate since it is geared off of the 2018 year end step off of AUCA and AUM levels. And over the same period, the rates picture has markedly changed too, with the consensus moving from two Fed hikes in 2019 to nearly none.
Amidst this uncertain revenue environment, we will be laser focused on expenses. As you can see in the walk, we believe we can achieve approximately 4% in productivity saves, driven by our larger than usual 2019 expense program, which includes both resource discipline and process re-engineering improvements, partially offset by an approximately 3% of ongoing business and necessary IT investments. This should yield a net 1% reduction in 2019 total underlying cost, aside from the full year effect of CRD and notable items.
In addition, given the severe market environment, we currently expect to reduce expenses 2 percentage points from 4Q18 to 1Q19, excluding seasonally deferred compensation via our recent hiring freeze and senior management exits. While material percentage of our revenues informed by markets and not in our control, we can control expenses. We will intervene further if necessary.
Turning to fee revenue, with the December market selloff and increased volatility, there is a scenario where 1Q19 total fee revenue could be down quarter-on-quarter by 3 to 4 percentage points, driven by known factors including the market step off, the higher than historical pricing headwinds and the fiscal effects of lumpy revenues in CRD and trading. And because of the year end 2018 step off, even with a modest linear uptick in equity markets during 2019, we could see this 1Q fee revenue as our quarterly run rate for several quarters.

At this point, we’re operating the company under this scenario and we see sustained market uplift or further retreat, however, this picture could change. For example, in terms of market sensitivity, a 5 percentage point instantaneous uplift in markets is worth about 25 million per quarter to our servicing fee revenue with a lag of half a quarter. In regards to NII, we expect to see low to mid-single digit growth for the year. For 1Q, we expect a downtick, which would be fully accounted for by two fewer days and the absence of the 4Q episodic hedging benefits I mentioned earlier. Taxes should be in the 15% to 16% range for the year, though we expect 1Q19 to be higher at 18%. And finally, given the balance sheet repositioning undertaken in the fourth quarter, we are optimistic that we are better positioned for the 2019 CCAR process, subject of course to the Federal Reserve scenarios and associated approvals. Depending upon the specific CCAR scenarios, we would expect to target a total payout of over 80% for the upcoming CCAR cycle.
Finally to slide 17, in summary, full year 2018 was a mixed year. We had a solid start to the year with record new servicing wins of 1.9 trillion, which reflects our distinct servicing capabilities. Revenues started strong, but we had a difficult second half, given our exposure to weaker equity markets and challenging industry conditions. We continue to distinguish ourselves in FX trading as well as how we've effectively driven NII growth, as we've engaged with clients. All told, EPS increased 22% and ROE increased 1.6 percentage points. On the capital front, we are better positioned for the 2019 CCAR cycle and one of our top priorities is to return substantial capital to shareholders this year.
Finally, as I outlined a few moments ago, we are taking immediate action to adjust our expense base for this new revenue environment and we're confident the actions we announced today position us well to reduce our 2019 underlying expense base, relative to last year.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.
Ron O'Hanley
Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Glenn Schorr
Further comment on the pricing, because I think we all get that the market drops and so fee start out lower. That's, I don't think a surprise at this point. The worst pricing, what I'm curious about is, how it manifests itself, in other words, I think you used the phrase this year, I mean, this year is like 2 weeks old. So are we talking about each new contract that comes up as it comes up and it kind of rolls over like the next five years, I just wanted to get -- understand a little bit more about what's new about the -- because pricing has gone down like the last 30 years straight?
Ron O'Hanley
This is Ron. Let me start on that and then Eric will probably want to say something on it. The way pricing works in there or historically has worked in this business and particularly for us since our business is disproportionately for asset managers is that when you reprice, there are some assumptions built in around market and as importantly around flows. I mean, if you serve asset managers, you get the business and then over time it accumulates. We've gone through -- the industry has gone through a very large number of repricings for all the reasons that I've outlined earlier in terms of the pressure that clients are under and those same assumptions, at least on our part have been applied and I assume on everybody else’s part. 
We had a year of very sharp down market and as importantly no flows. So between the volume of pricing and the fact that the usual kind of assumptions haven't yet played out, that's what's led to one, our results, particularly towards the latter half of 2018 and second for our outlook. Now, it's obviously -- we have to, as part of the pricing discipline that we've talked about, we’re rethinking these assumptions in terms of market and how much, if at all, to rely on flows, but that's really what we're referring to here.

Do you want to add anything?
Eric Aboaf
Yeah. Glenn, I’ll just add that historically we've seen pricing headwinds for decades in this business, just part of the underlying assumptions or some pricing headwinds offset by flows and activity and market appreciation, as well the structure the contracts are set up and those have historically been in the 1.5% to 2% range. Literally, over the last half decade, we've gone back a decade and we've got that history. We've seen closer to 4% headwinds this year. 
And if we think about the coming year, we expect about the same. That said, we've been renegotiating our contracts, right, and extending term. We've been putting in place some clarity around expectations on volumes and market levels and so forth. And while we're a bit more than halfway through those contract negotiations, the negotiations happen, then the fee changes occur and then we actually have to live through that. So we're just a bit below the majority of what we are going to need to live through and that's just part of what we have to navigate. 
I will say that the fee headwinds tend to hit a little more in the earlier part of the year than the latter part, just because of the kind of calendarization. And so that's incorporated in our forecast. The net is that, at the end of the day, this is part of our industry. We feel like this is a wave, it's a larger wave than we've seen in the past and -- than usual – and we think there will be some reversion to the mean. But that said, it strengthens our resolve that we've got to work on expenses. We've got to take expenses out, we've got improved productivity and we've got to adjust our cost structure to be in line with what the revenues are that we can earn.
Glenn Schorr
That actually leads to just my other follow-up is, if you could talk about the timing and ramping of, say, both the cost save program, because it's more headcount than comp focused and then also, while we're at it, the timing and ramping of the one, but not yet funded pipeline, because those could be partial offsets as well obviously.
Eric Aboaf
Yeah. Let me start on the expense side, because that's, I've been putting a lot of my time personally with Ron and the management team on that and I think you saw in my prepared remarks, I gave you a sense of what we expect to do in terms of expenses for the year on an underlying basis, down 1% and because we've been intervening month by month and quarter by quarter, we expect total expense to be down on an underlying basis by about 2 percentage points from 4Q to 1Q. But we're trying to just adjust and that just comes in stepwise the increments. 
I think at the same time, there are some ramping of some of the ongoing investments that we need to do and so that's what -- that's what will get the lines to meet at about that 1% down for the year. But, we're trying to peel off expenses, we've got a relatively fixed cost base, so we've got to take it down in steps and at the same time, we got to do it carefully, so that we continue to serve our clients well and deliver the services in the highest quality manner.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Ken Usdin
Hey, Eric, I was wondering if you could help us flush out the point you made about not run rating CRD? And can you help us understand just what your expected contribution would be, if possible, both on the revenue side for more of a full year ‘19 basis and also on the cost side? I think what you've given us is the underlying on the expense, but it would be helpful if you could give us a sense of how you're thinking about the CRD adds? Thanks.
Eric Aboaf
Sure. Let me describe CRD in a little more detail and I think we provided the fourth quarter P&L here on page 10 of the materials. Think about it this way, revenues have a seasonality in CRD, because of the kind of natural calendarization that happens in sales, in a software oriented business and I think you'll see that in most of the software business that you or some of your colleagues may cover. We disclosed that we -- that the fourth quarter is typically 30% to 35% of full year revenues, that's a rough amount. It will vary a bit, but that's probably at least something to start with and so part of the guidance I gave on total fees for 4Q to 1Q includes the natural downtick that you’d see after that fourth quarter seasonal position. And I think you can kind of build models off of that.

In terms of expenses, these are first quarterly expenses, what we are doing in CRD is all the things you'd expect and we've described, right, we're tackling those 80 or 90 engagement -- client engagements. We've begun to build out the sales force further that was part of our intention. We've added and we're adding product engineers for installation, because that tends to be the bottleneck, not just sales, but actually the ability to install and to install in a timely manner. So the expenses for CRD will ramp during the year as we integrate. That's all part of the accretion dilution analysis that -- and commitments we made.
And so I think you've got to assume some ramp that would be representative of what you might do, were you to run a software company, where you are trying to effectively double the revenue growth rate, because that is the underlying goal. Remember, the original -- the growth rate in this business historically over the last four or five years has been about 7% top line. The kind of on Charles River synergies should take that through a series of different actions to double that and so we need to invest in the earlier quarters and years to deliver on that.
Ken Usdin
And then if I just take that back up to the top of the house, I think the comments you gave us on the fees were on an all-inclusive basis, so if I think about what you just added on the CRD, what's your concept of just -- and I know it's harder, given your opening comments, but just the ability to deliver positive operating leverage and given the tougher market environment and some of the pricing points and how are you going to -- how you're trying to balance that, can you do positive fee operating leverage with this outlook or is it just going to be one of those, hey, we've got to make it through this and then the longer term, we come back to it as the market improves?
Eric Aboaf
Ken, it's more the latter to be honest, right. I've been real clear about the change in the market environment just over the last month and a half, right, whether it's equity market levels, whether it's even lower flows, I think, December long term outflows between US and Europe were, just in December were $100 billion negative. Through November of the year, they weren't even $200 billion negative. So this -- and then we have all the geopolitical and macroeconomic and trade questions. And so that makes us feel that we should be conservative and careful in how we run the company. And as a result, I think what we've done here as part of our prepared remarks is be real clear about what we can do and should be doing on expenses. We are -- we think there's a ranges, I think there's a range of scenarios on revenues and what I'd rather do is just give you good visibility into the coming quarter or quarters on revenue as I get that and then a real commitment on the expenses and just be in touch as developments change.
Ron O'Hanley
Ken, what I would add to that is that we believe we need to manage the company with this somewhat muted outlook. There's so much uncertainty out there in terms of the macro environment, what it means for markets and what it means for investor flows. Having said that, we continue to be very encouraged by the client activity that we see, some of it Charles River driven, some of it driven simply by our increase in service quality and the drive for clients to think about more consolidation, but we really do understand that those macro effects can actually overwhelm anything that we might do and then I am actually confident we will do on the revenue side, so it makes sense for us to manage the company on the expense basis with that muted outlook.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS.
Brennan Hawken

Just want to try to think about this in the context of the medium term targets that you guys laid out in early December. I believe the targets included a 10% to 15% GAAP EPS and it was my understanding that that was the one medium term metric that actually intended to apply for each year, it would apply to actually 2019. So number one, now that we know what GAAP EPS for ‘18 is at 6.40, I want to make sure that that is still intact and then maybe help me understand how to get there, because to think about adding in CRD operating expenses of 160 and amortization and such to the expense guide that you give in the deck, with net of the cuts you’re making and then also layering in, Eric, your reference to some sustained fee rate pressure, which seems like we had stability in 4Q, but maybe you're indicating that that was -- that's temporary and we should think about some further fee rate pressure from here, so maybe, I might not be thinking about correctly, hopefully you can provide some clarity? Thanks.
Eric Aboaf
Brennan, it's Eric. Let me take that. We made some very clear commitments for the medium term across a series of different financial elements from capital return to reigniting revenue growth, EPS and so forth. I thinks in the last month and a half, as I said in my prepared remarks, the environment has really changed for this year 2019 and whether it's the equity markets off 10%, whether it's long term flows racking, one of the worst months of the last few years, whether it's a geopolitical and economic environment, getting -- taking another step down or sideways, we now think there is a wider range of revenue scenarios than I think we consciously had in mind in early December, as we put up those medium term targets a bit. 
So I think from my perspective is we are going to hold to the medium term targets, I think the 2019 year itself is going to be a more challenging one. And at this point, what I’d not like to do is be too optimistic. I think a year ago, in this call, we were a bit too optimistic, as the environment changed and didn't react quickly enough and I think our perspective is, we've got to take a more conservative perspective here and update you as it comes, but I think 2019 will be more challenging than we had expected just a couple of months ago.
Brennan Hawken
Good to know that my math isn't totally way off. And then thinking about the deposit cost front for my follow up. You guys continued to show a 50% beta, which is encouraging. Looks like the likelihood of a further rate hike has deteriorated. So, can you walk us through maybe how we should think about deposit cost pressure and your expectations for deposit costs in a 2019, where we don't see further increases in short term rates, could we still continue to see upward pressure on that deposit cost and what are your expectations there.
Eric Aboaf
Sure, Brennan. Deposit costs and betas will continue to float upwards. I think we've been, 2 years ago, early on, we were in the 20% range for beta as we moved into the 30% to 35% range for a while. This year, we’re right smack in the middle of the 50%, 55% range and we certainly expect that during the year that will continue to tick up and we've seen that in other firms and so that's inherent in our forecast. We think it will jump up to very, very high levels, not, we don't have any indication that that would be the case and so we just expect to continue grind up our betas and continued modest transition from non-interest bearing into interest bearing. 
I think one of the things that gives us confidence in the NII outlook of low single digits to mid-single digits is that, just by virtue of the 4Q step off, right, we build off of that during the course of the year, as we've expanded our coverage program, one of the earliest efforts that Ron and I started, I'd say it was probably about a year ago was actually client engagement on deposits, right, the full suite of what they need to do with their cash and that in our minds has actually really solidified the deposit gathering with our clients and gives us some capability to put the right amount of volume of deposits on our balance sheet. 

And so what we would like to do this year and obviously subject to ebbs and flows in the market is to not only hold deposits steady, but see if we can drive them up somewhat because that would be part of how we deploy the balance sheet in a positive way. And if we can do that plus get some of that high quality lending that the 40x leverage fund needs or the private equity capital call lending that they need, that would also be a positive. So, there are a couple of different dimensions there that we're working on to drive some growth in this coming year.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Blostein
So I was hoping we can double click on some of the things we talked about here in more detail. So I guess starting with fee pressure, I guess, one, I guess what gives you guys confidence that the pressure will normalize beyond 2019, so sort of why doesn't the 4% annual drag doesn't continue beyond that period? And if you guys could provide a little bit of color in terms of customer segments in particular, client types, geographies, things like that to help us get a better flavor of where the pain points are?
Ron O'Hanley
Alex, this is Ron. I think that where I begin on that is that the -- much of the pricing discussions have occurred and started in earnest with the combination of the ongoing pressure on the big active managers or managers in general, but certainly the big active managers, while at the same time, markets were running up and clients were seeing that State Street and [indiscernible] gathering more revenues for doing really the same things. So it led to what we would view as an accelerated amount and a heightened amount of fee discussions. As Eric outlined though, as we've gone into this period, one, we've moved and pretty much insisted upon term for our pricing. 
So in other words, to make it a little less variable than it's been in the past and second, in most cases, we’ve actually gathered more business as part of the pricing discussion. So the reason why we feel confident that it will abate, it's never going to go away, but that it will abate is, one, as Eric noted I think, we're through about, just over 50% of our clients in terms of discussions on this. A little bit more than that and for the ones that we've done it, we've extended term and gotten more business. So that's why we would feel that this is a bit of a cyclical low here, but feel confident that it should improve.
Eric Aboaf
Alex, it’s Eric. I’d just also say that this is obviously a phenomenon that started in the US, the US asset managers were under more pressure sooner and earlier, right, because of the flows of active to passive. We've had now similar discussions in Europe. There we think it's not to be quite as difficult, partly because the kind of the ETF mutual fund differential isn't as sizable, but we'll see. So it's affecting primarily the asset managers as a segment that’s seeing where those are most intense and a little less so some of the other pension or in insurance type companies. That said, we have had run ups in the marketplace and oftentimes, these fee negotiations become more intense after run ups in the marketplace. 
Why? Because if you just think about yourself being an asset manager, right, you're paying us fees that are scaled to market levels, markets appreciate, you look at your bill, your bill is going up and your natural inclination will be, well, let me go and talk to my bill provider about how can I get some of that back. And so we have seen, as we've gone back for half a decade, a decade or more, some connection between run up in markets followed by more severe adjustments in pricing. And so I think if we get some normalization to kind of more steady growth in markets, we think we'll get some reversion of the mean, whether this 4% level goes back to the 1.5% to 2%, we'll see, whether it goes back to somewhere between them, we'll see and obviously as we see more, we'll share more with you.

Alex Blostein
And then my second question was around securities lending, looking at $120 million run rate this quarter, can you help break out what's kind of still enhanced custody versus traditional agency model and again assuming environment stays roughly the same, is this sort of the low at 120 run rate or you guys are still working through how to reposition the enhanced custody business for CCAR? I thought you said earlier in the call that that’s still a bit ongoing, so I'm just trying to get a better sense of what the jumping off point is?
Eric Aboaf
Yeah. At this point, the revenues in securities lending are, let’s see, about 120 for the quarter. It's roughly 60-40, 55-45, classic agency lending versus enhanced custody. So it's kind of in that – and in that range. I think there are two things going on right now in this area and it's really around the agency area. I think we've seen some stability, reasonable stability in enhanced custody. But on the classic agency lending, we've seen some real market, with markets levels falling, you have just assets on -- loans are lower. We've seen de-leveraging by some of the hedge funds who need to borrow. 
So there's less demand out there and as a result, spreads have come down as well. And I think the question is, what happens, one question is what happens to market levels and demand in first quarter. And if you remember, we ended December, I think, at close to 10% below S&P levels for October-November. We've had a little bit of a bounce back, but if that persists, we're still likely to have a lower average, highly likely to have a lower average first quarter than fourth quarter and so that's going to create some dampening measures on demand and you still have some hedge funds continue to de-leverage. So there's clearly a market demand element here that makes us feel careful about the 4Q to 1Q and is embedded in my sequential fee guidance. 
I think the other part is the counterparty work that we've had to do with CCAR does have more of an effect on sec lending and while I think we've been through most of it, I don't think we've been through all of it in the agency space, which is kind of just a little more than half of sec lending. In FX, I think we've done a terrific job in diversifying counter parties, innovating, doing compression trades, right, the tools are quite vast and the number of counter parties out there are quite significant and the team has really turned on a dime to kind of adjust their processes. 
In agency lending, it's much more concentrated business. There is fewer kind of transaction types available to us and so it's something we're working through and need a little bit of time on. That said, I would tell you agency lending and securities lending and enhanced custody continue to be an area of innovation for us. The question is, how can you structure trades in various approaches to actually refine and actually connect counter parties as opposed to always be the intermediary and still earn a fee and effectively add innovation in what's been a historically unchanged marketplace. So more to come on that and we'll certainly talk more over the coming quarters.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Betsy Graseck
Eric, just to follow up on that. Could you give us a sense of, if you ran through your new positioning on last year CCAR, how much it would have changed the results?
Ron O'Hanley
I’m chuckling Betsy because that's the question we – our capital team would like to ask the Fed, right, that's the -- how do the models work. I'd tell you this that on the investment portfolio we and I think the other large banks have done quite a bit of work on the mark to market effect and how the mark to market on the OCI positions could be modeled and we've now got 5, 6, I think we've got 6 or more data points, their data points with changing portfolios. 

So, how much is it worth, I think we've got a range of estimates. I think the reason we felt comfortable saying that we're optimistic about our capital position is if you think about it, if we have earnings of what it's been the 2.5 billion, 3 billion a year, we know how much we like to return and we know what every 10 percentage points of those earnings are in terms of capital return and so if 10 percentage points of capital return at $300 million, right, we have some sense for how much you’d have to adjust the mark to market impact to create another 10 percentage points or 20 percentage points of return and that's kind of the math we've done. So I don't really want to be in a position to predict AOCI impacts on our portfolio. We could all do rough estimates, but that's how we've thought about it and that's maybe the kind of the quantitative context I'd share with you.
Betsy Graseck
And then just separately, the Fed has talked about proposing CCAR stress tests, it's only run on RWAs and not on leverage ratios, have you thought through what that could mean for you.
Ron O'Hanley
Yeah. I think we've done the modeling of that. I think there's been a fair amount of outside in modeling and right now, I think tier 1 leverage is our finding constraint and under the stress test. The difference between a tier 1 leverage binding constraint versus an RWA binding constraint, while it's not perfectly discernable, rough estimates, $1 billion range, maybe a 1.5 billion, but it kind of depends on exactly how the test is run, what the timing is of the various market factors and so forth, but that has some real material benefit and I think we are optimistic that with [indiscernible] having passed and the Fed working on the implementation of that and some of the Vice Chairman’s comments that there is some real movement is just a matter of time and hopefully months, not quarter is when we hear more, but it’s an important positive for us.
Betsy Graseck
And then just a little bigger picture, I know you've talked a bit about, if then scenarios on revenues and expenses and I guess I'm just trying to understand if you have a more muted revenue outlook, Ron, maybe you could just give us a sense as to, do you have to invest to get further cost saves or do you feel like there still is opportunity because I know you did a big restructuring here. And I'm just trying to understand, is further potential expense opportunities really incremental or is there more that you can chop?
Ron O'Hanley
So what we've done is going after the expenses that one we just should go after and second, what we believe we need to go after, given what you're hearing from us is a cautious outlook going forward. If your question is, is there more to go after, of course there is and we've got -- we've noted a comprehensive program in place that we actually expect to be able to drive more. We also have the work that's been done in the past that I can't emphasize enough in terms of Beacon, the work that's underway in terms of consolidating our delivery and all of our operations and those efforts will continue to pay off in 2019 and beyond. And then finally, to the extent to which we saw an environment that was even worse than the cautious one that you're hearing from us, we'd obviously start to look at things like the pattern of investment. I mean, that's the last thing we'll go after because we do believe that it's important. What we have what we think is a sensible investment program, adjusted to the opportunities and market realities, but if we had to, we’d look at that again too.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Bedell
Maybe I'll just start with expenses and then move on to revenue growth question. So first, just on expenses, just to clarify for 2019. I'm getting basically to about an 8.6 billion core expense run rate and what you exclude from that is the CRD amortization and any CRD acquisition related expenses. But it would also include delivery costs to achieve the revenue synergies that you outlined when you did the deal, which would be some portion of that 180 to 200 and maybe if you can – Eric, if you can talk about how you're looking at those delivery costs for 2019 and then the trajectory of expenses going into 2020, given that we're potentially guiding down on expenses and saves as the year?

Eric Aboaf
Brian, it's Eric. Let me try to do this from a couple of different directions. I think page 16 of the deck is probably a helpful starting point, because we kind of define the underlying 2018 expenses as you know that’s ex CRD and so forth. And then where we expect those to end at the end of ’19. I think you do need to take -- put CRD in there. First quarter, scale it up and I think while we will be investing, I'd ask you to think through how quickly can you invest well in a business, right, there's little bit of a bounding limit there and if you're at a $40 million run rate in 4Q, it just -- think about, I think, there's a range, but I think you can quickly come to what's reasonable versus an unreasonable set of expense growth rate off of that level. 
So I think you can work off of that. You do have to factor in the intangible amortization, which we've defined there and then the acquisition and restructuring costs will also flow through. I think this quarter is a good example of what a run rate should be on a quarterly basis, but we’ll obviously take those as they come, in line with the actions we’ve take and the appropriate accounting. So those are the pieces, happy to work with you and IR team to take a look at how you're modeling it out and take things from there.
Brian Bedell
Okay. We’ll do that offline. And then just on the revenue side, maybe Ron, if you could just characterize how those conversations are going, you mentioned the 98 client engagements with Charles River customers and if you could give some perspective, maybe some refresh perspective on the trajectory of revenue synergies, appreciate that that’s a 2021 goal, but if you could sort of give us a sense of how optimistic you are on winning new business from the game plan of talking with the CRD clients and the concept that you mentioned at the outset of the pressure that asset managers are facing and whether they're very receptive to the partnering concept?
Ron O'Hanley
So, let me start with the question on optimism. We're very optimistic about achieving, if not exceeding those revenue synergy goals. The nature of the conversations, let me give you some sense of those. Some of them are simply that the CRD clients, they like the new owner, the new owner is in private equity, so they see stability and there's just more CRD activity happening, more movement from shrink-wrap to cloud, all of which is good from a revenue and profitability perspective from CRD. 
There's also a series of client -- a series of client conversations where it may be a State Street client with no CRD presence or a CRD client that sees the value of having more of their activities with State Street and CRD together and the attraction of those of course is a simplification of the internal operations and operating stack and technology stack. And then there's a set of conversations that we, in all honesty, hadn't expected to be having, which is clients, where we either don't serve them now or we serve them in a minimal way or even in a couple of cases where there was a competitive bidding situation and we lost typically for price that are all being looked at again. So it's pervasive, it's comprehensive and it's driven by all these -- all these things we talk about in the marketplace, which are real negatives to short term revenues, but we think are real positives to seeing more business consolidate with us and us having, in the end, a much higher share of the wallet.
Brian Bedell
And do you think you can -- based on those conversations achieve those revenue synergies in a potentially linear fashion over the next three years or is it more hockey stick towards 20 and 21?
Ron O'Hanley
It's a little bit too early to tell on whether the pattern is going to change, Brian, because these are pretty comprehensive discussions. You try and move them along as fast as you can, but they take time, because you're really talking about a once in a generation change in these firms in terms of how they're going to run their business. So right now, we're sticking to the timeframe, but I would emphasize that we're highly confident in achieving the amount.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Mike Carrier
Good morning, so first question. Just on expenses, I guess I want to kind of step away from the expense program and the 350, but just thinking about sort of the core business, maybe like what has been done to make the cost structure maybe more variable, just given some of the uncertainties that you have on the revenue side, some of the pricing trends that you're seeing and basically, if it's -- the revenue is going to be tough to predict, I'm just trying to gauge, when we think about some of the lines like comp, transaction, other, like how much of that is variable that can kind of ebb and flow with the revenue backdrop versus what's fixed or more structural.
Eric Aboaf
Mike, it's Eric. Let me start on that one because the nature of our business has actually become, in terms of expenses, more fixed than variable and partly that is, as we automate, as we put more capital work and labor and we need to make that shift be even more dramatic to be honest and, I think, as Ron describes, we feel good about some of the investments we've made in some of the automation, but I don't think we've sufficiently adjusted the stack of labor that we have against it, but our business is actually becoming more fixed than variable over time. 
And I think that means two things. I think that means from an expense program and programmatic standpoint, we need to find ways to take out step level, kind of step function expenses off of -- out of our expense base, so as we automate we need to take labor out, as we work with vendors, we need to find ways to adjust downwards, as we get larger and they get larger and we force the scale benefits to accrue to both parties. So that's part of what we just need to do because of the nature of how this business has evolved, relative to where it was as a highly manual, highly variable business, 10, 20, 30 years ago.
I think the second perspective that we've developed as a senior team here is because it's more fixed than variable, we actually need to find ways that in good times, we create more margin expansion and more leverage because in truth, while we have an ability to take some step wise and step function reductions in the expenses, in difficult times, it's hard to adjust the level that we would like, given that revenues could move as much as they are moving up or down. 
And so I think our historic belief that we should run with operating leverage of maybe a point in good times, I think that's not really something that makes sense as we step back and think about how this business has been operated, it may have made sense in the past, but that's something that we need to change. And so we first need to work through this particular market environment, but that gives you at least some context as to how we're thinking about this going forward as well.
Ron O'Hanley
Mike I want to add to Eric's last point there because I think part of the challenge that we're facing now is that in the past, the costs have been too variable, as the business has grown and it's not that there were people have been through it, we had these distributed operations and we just weren't achieving scale benefits as rapidly as we should have, as we could have been. With the work that's been done over the last year, not just Beacon, but this consolidation of our operations into this global delivery group and the creation and running of these hubs, that is the goal is to achieve much better scale benefits and as a consequence, we should be able to deliver what Eric's talking about in terms of in good times, actually more operating leverage than we have in the past.
Mike Carrier
And then just a quick follow up. You guys mentioned some of the pricing challenges across most of the asset servicing or asset management industry versus CNF, but when you think about some of the other products, services that you're offering, where are you seeing the areas where you're not seeing maybe the same level of pressure, there's more maybe growth opportunity that you can allocate resources to?

Eric Aboaf
Mike, it’s Eric. I think the answer to your question really is around the product stack that we offer. If you think about it, custody for example is the most commoditized of our products. Then there's accounting, then there's funded administration, the prospectus creation, then there is middle office, where I think we've actually gotten to be better about how we and smarter about how we price and operate that business. So as you move up the product stack, I think we see and actually more recently with some of the new SEC reporting requirements and so forth, we've seen more pricing power and I think in fact in terms of something like CRD or software, there's actually effectively inflation escalators in contracts because of the nature of that business and of that industry. 
So part of this is kind of where you are in the stack, which actually I think encourages us to continue to pivot and make sure that when we're offering custody, we also do accounting. When we do accounting, we also do administration and so on and so forth. And so that's maybe a little bit of flavor as to where you have strength. I think the other places we have found that where we have clients that are moving in different directions, de-leveraging or what have you and as their books adjust downwards, we have gone back and said, look, we need to adjust pricing accordingly and in particular, in the hedge fund space, that's been an important part of the back and forth. 
And then lastly I’d tell you the other place that we're working through as pricing is not only as we have price discussions we asked for more wallet and more share of wallet in a much more rigorous and disciplined manner and controlled manner, we've – Ron and I have put in place with some of our most senior folks, very rigorous processes there, but we've also had very active discussions about being paid for in different ways, being paid for with more deposits left with us than with some of the other players and that's been another area where I think we've found some ability to be paid appropriately for the service we provide.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Jim Mitchell
Maybe just a follow up on Eric on your outlook on NII and NIM, if the Fed were to stop, I mean, historically State Street has seen leverage once the Fed stops, as assets reprice and deposit betas typically or deposit repricing has stopped pretty quickly, because you have high deposit betas during rate hikes and then you stop, sounds like, you didn't, I guess, reinforce that view. So has something changed or should we -- how do you think about Fed deposit pricing once the Fed stops and given where your securities portfolio yield is, it’s still well below 2%, 2-year Treasury, should we expect your securities yield to grind a little higher over -- once the Fed stops, so just thoughts on NIM.
Eric Aboaf
Yes. Let me tackle it from a couple of different directions. I think if the Fed stops now, there are a couple ways that we will get some incremental growth in NII. First, just get the fourth quarter run rate over the earlier quarters will create a full year back to ‘19 relative to ’18, that's the first piece. The second piece, as you described is that the investment portfolio tractor continues to work upwards and that's worth, we continue to have investment coupons higher than those that are falling off, it’s a little more complicated for our book, because we operate not only in the US geography, but also the international geography, but there is more there. I think third, there is a continued mixing of the portfolio. 
We've historically run with a very large kind of a barbell portfolio of credit and treasuries. I think you've seen in some of the changes that we made, the first quarter of ‘18 and then the fourth quarter of ’18, you've seen we've shifted into more of agency MBS portfolio that gives us some pickup relative to treasuries and then we've also shifted in the foreign sovereigns, it's -- you can see it directly, but out of some of the sovereign versus some of the supers and also and the other types of global government agencies. So we think there is some amount of grind up work. 

And then I think, the final one, which in some ways is most connected to the business is how do we continue engaging with our clients on cash and how do we actually find ways to create better solutions for them on cash, right. And I think that's where, it's not only their cash position, but it’s their needs for repo, whether it's direct repo or FIC repo, it’s their money market sweeps and so forth. And so each one of those is a very engaged conversation, to the extent that we can drive some amount of volume growth, we feel like backing follow the bottom line and that will just, we can just report on as we see developments.
Jim Mitchell
And on the deposit pricing point, do the prices go up still despite no rate hikes?
Eric Aboaf
No. I think you get a little bit of the tail end of December, flowing through the first quarter, but you get some relative stability in deposit pricing I think. I think on a direct basis, I think the question is how much competition is there out there in a flat rate environment, I think what happens is what happens to the competition for deposits in the banking system and while we don't directly compete, there is always some spillover effect and so if we get a situation where lending grows relatively quickly for a time period, back to the 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% range and banks need to fund that lending with deposits and there's more deposit competition, then you can see pricing, then you can see pricing go in the favor of clients and against the favor of the banks. I don't think we see that at this point, but we're always watching carefully.
Jim Mitchell
And then as a follow up question, just on your revenue, fee revenue forecast, can you just for our modeling purposes, help us understand what market levels you're kind of assuming, I see that in the footnote, you talk about 5% growth from December levels, obviously, right now, we’re up 6% to 8% in the US, depending on which index. What are you assuming in your first and second quarters to give us that kind of fee guidance?
Eric Aboaf
At this point, what we've done is, we've started off of the December 31st step off with that for the US and for the international markets as well. I'm a little cautious on a particular quarter, so just that's why I gave some guidance on total fees for 1Q. Because the way our pricing works is some of it's geared to the, literally, the month end. Some of it's geared to daily averages, sometimes it's a 2 point average and so there is a mix and so it was not helpful that you get that December 31st print. 
And I think the other part that's going on here is flows and client activity matter, right. I think in my remarks, I describes that flows, because the natural course of business on flows and remember we get because of the size of our business in the US and in EMEA for asset managers, we get about a third of the inflows that you see in the industry, we get that in our books and records, right, in our custodial counts. But those kinds of flows and then the client activity or that transactional activity is material. That's historically been worth 2 percentage points of growth over the course of annually, right. And right now, we're not seeing much of that at all and so that's another reason why we are quite cautious on the first quarter and we've added a little bit of wording around that as well.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Brian Kleinhanzl
A quick question on the market sensitivity that you gave, you mentioned that a 5% uplift is 25 million in servicing fees. So I mean, if you put that relative to what the 2018 revenues are, it's about 1% revenue uptick for the 5% uplift in the markets. So last quarter when you gave that, it was 10% and it gives you a 3% increase, so a 30% pull through rate. This quarter, now, it's down to a 20% pull through rate. So when you finish all these renegotiations that you have ongoing, how does the market sensitivity look when all said and done, I mean, do you expect it to be another step down for market sensitivity from here?

Eric Aboaf
Brian, it's Eric. I think we gave relatively consistent guidance, so the historical guidance that we’ve given in our -- is around 10% change in equity markets is worth about 3 percentage points. So on a base of $5 billion of servicing fees, right, that's about $150 million. I think what I said earlier today in my prepared remarks is that 5 percentage points, about 10 is worth about 25 a quarter, but you lose part of that first quarter, so you get a little more than 75, you get call it 85 to 90. So you're kind of within the range of that 10% and 3%, which would give you $150 million. The other part of that is you get a little bit of sensitivity on management fees that you also have to work through, so we can go through that with the offline, but just trying to give kind of some ranges there, so that you could do a little bit of estimation.
Brian Kleinhanzl
Maybe the general assumption is it should be moving lower, as you're trying to fix -- move to more fixed pricing in the asset servicing business.
Eric Aboaf
Well, I think -- just to clarify, what's happened in -- on the cost structure is the cost structure has become more fixed and less variable. That's on the cost side. On the pricing side, I don't think we have really seen shifts at pricing and pricing structures at this point. I mean, at this point, we still have pricing, which has asset levels as the basis, we have some pricing that is around transactional fees and we have some pricing that's fixed, but there's still some real variability baked into our pricing and we don't see that pricing structure as having changed in new contracts that we're negotiating now relative to those that we've had it, it’s for the level pricing has been adjusted downward and what we're trying to do in several different ways is put controls around our internal processes on how those are negotiated, what we get for them, not only in terms of servicing fees and markets and the FX and security lending and deposits, but also who's engaged at what level of seniority in those discussions, because those are in some ways the most important discussions that we should be having at the most senior levels in our counterparties.
Brian Kleinhanzl
And I just want to clarify one thing on that fee guidance, as you had mentioned. I mean, you were talking about AUM and AUC, right, before you gave the guidance, but I mean you were talking about total fee revenues being down 3% to 4% in the first quarter from fourth quarter, correct?
Eric Aboaf
Yeah. That's correct and that just includes all of our fee categories. Correct.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Mike Mayo
Hey, Ron. I hear what you're saying, you have a new expense program, merger synergies with Charles River, you're increasing intensity, but here's my question. What assurance can you give that savings will be sustainable and what is your new pretax margin target and before answering, here's what’s in my head. State Street said that it achieved all savings from business ops and IT transformation and almost all the savings from Project Beacon and had a target at the start of the decade to improve the pretax margin from 29% in 2010 to 33%. But over this 8 year period, State Street, not only missed its own pretax margin target, but the pretax margin declined from 29% in 2010 to 28% last year. 
So while the pretax margin got worse over 8 years, State Street took victory laps on earnings calls, from press releases and its proxy and Ron, I know this is predates you, but still this is a question to what extent is the board looking after shareholder interests, to what extent would State Street apply clawbacks to the prior CEO's pay. Jay, a Grade A person, you've always treated me well, you guys have given me access, but at some point, don't you have to look at the business and say, well, actually, the targets were not met, but again the question is, what assurance can you give that the new potential savings are sustainable? Thank you.

Ron O'Hanley
Mike, I'm not going to spend too much time on what happened in the past, but what happened over that decade in terms of regulatory costs and things like that that may or may not have been in the forecasts or presented, but let me talk about going forward and the assurances here. One, there's been a lot of work done and I keep coming back to Beacon, I keep coming back to what we're doing in terms of consolidated operations that we have not realized the full promise from. We need to accelerate that, but this is not something that we're just thinking about, this is actually work that's underway, has been completed and we need to make sure that we realize the benefits from that. 
Two, as we were talking about earlier, the business, as revenues have come on in this firm, costs have gone up almost at the same rate. We have not gotten sufficient scale advantages, because of the work that's been done and frankly because of the way we're going to manage the business going forward, we will capture more scale benefits. Three, the board is very involved in this. We've worked with them on our new performance management and accountability system and there's a very, very close tie, more so than ever between pay and performance. And so we've got incentives aligned across the firm, so I am confident that we will deliver on what we've said here and we need to do that because we understand that firstly, just to be in a position, to be able to service the business that we see coming down the road, we have to achieve all this. Secondly, we recognize that while there are certain things we can control, there's a lot of things we can’t such as markets, such as client flows and things like that, so therefore that's why we need to redouble the efforts around there. So in those periods, like a 2018, that we don't see that same kind of fall off.
Mike Mayo
And just a follow up, again, from covering State Street for a while and again this predates you, a lot of comments about the success of these prior programs, when business ops and IT transformation was first launched, it talked about improving scale and you think you'd see the scale benefits in the pretax margin, so with your more fresh view, do you say what should investors think about State Street for the past decade, given the success of these programs, but then the bottom line not really changing as much, what's your more fresh perspective?
Ron O'Hanley
I point to two things. One is that I don't think that anybody at the beginning of the last decade anticipated the significance of regulatory cost increase and just what that would be. Second, we have been slow to achieve scale. We have not achieved as much scale at the pace that we should have and that's where we've got laser focused right now.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Gerard Cassidy
Can you share with us, when you look at your fee revenue for this quarter, let's call it 2.3 billion, you gave us some color on the servicing fee sensitivity to the markets, but out of the total 2.3 billion, how much is at equity related. Ron mentioned that you've got a disproportionate amount of equity customers in your client base, so what would be a good estimate of that number being tied to equity type customers?
Eric Aboaf
Gerard, I’m trying to think if we have a quantitative estimate in our disclosure on that. We do disclose the mix of some of the ACAs in our supplement, the mix of equities in for our asset management business and then obviously our sec lending is a heavy equity based underlying business. So I do think that we have higher equity exposure than kind of the servicing industry in aggregate. I don't know that I have an excellent estimate, because remember even when we custody for funds that are multiple asset funds, there is a wide range. If you do turn to page 9 in our financial supplement, you will see that there is one thought of our $31.6 trillion of assets under custody and we described 18 billion of those being equity based. 

So I think that's a good indication on the custodial side and then on the asset management side, we also do the equity cut on page 10. So, it's significant, it's in the -- you can see it's in the 55, 60, 60-ish percentage range and so we are somewhat dependent on equity markets. I think that's why, in good times, we need -- we're going to be able to benefit from that, but we also need to make sure that we are heavily – that we are always careful on expenses and create that scalable cost base, so that we don't actually add too many costs in good time, so that we can navigate through. But it is certainly part of our business model.
Gerard Cassidy
And then to follow up, I think Ron, you touched on the pricing headwinds historically or maybe Eric you brought it up that 1.5% to 2% was something that was common, but it looked like in 2018, it bumped up to 4%, you're looking for something similar in 2019. What's driving that? Is that competitors are just being much more aggressive and they're willing to price products at maybe, leaving a loss as just the way of getting the business and maybe cross selling other products, but what do you think has driven it up to doubling what it used to be?
Ron O'Hanley
Gerard, I think it's what we said earlier, the amount I heard these clients are on is quite high. So typical asset manager, whether you're large, medium or small. So there's just inordinate pressure coming from the client base with the number one. Number two, this assumption, particularly when you're pricing an asset management client, that there'll be both market and fees that will over time actually make what looks like an entry level price, that takes an entry level price and may look like it's too thin, kind of make it fall over time as flows and market help out. 
When that assumption goes away, it just lays bare that the price that you had as an initial price on a sustained basis in fact isn't sustainable. So at least for us, can't speak for the obviously rest of the industry, it has caused us to be much more careful about how we think about this. That in addition to getting more term, so that pricing can change overnight, looking at what other products and as Eric talked about earlier, the product stack as you move up from custody becomes -- it tends to be less, it's not price insensitive, but less and less price sensitive or less and less commodity like, if you will. And looking hard at deposits and then as importantly, making sure that we try and get another part of the wallet or some consolidation out of it and in most cases, we're getting some or all of those kinds of things.

The next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Steven Chubak
So I wanted to ask a follow-up question on capital return. Last year, in CCAR, you were about 50 basis points short of that stress tier 1 leverage target. Your capital ratios are flat year on year. Eric, you gave a lot of really helpful color, talking about the actions you've taken to improve your CCAR standing. What I'm wondering is if the Fed stress test assumptions are similar to last year, what gives you that confidence that you can achieve an 80% payout target. Is that – should we view that more as a medium term target or do you think you can get there in the upcoming tests?
Eric Aboaf
It's Eric. We're optimistic about this upcoming task where there's no certainty on it. So, but we're optimistic. I think we're optimistic for two reasons that we have under control and then there's one that we don't, right. The two that we do have are under our control are number one, the shape of the investment portfolio and if you remember, we made adjustments in the first quarter of last year, where we saw the results and how those played through in to CCAR, so we had a good understanding of the kind of the change this and then results in that and then we made some more adjustments to the fourth quarter of this year based on some of those learnings and the other six data points we've had over the last year.

The second one is because of the way we've now better understood the counterparty stress test that the Fed runs, right, we've actively intervened in terms of how we actually structure and limit our counterparty exposures across our businesses, whether that's in FX, whether that’s in securities lending and so we've made very conscious choices, some of which have impacted revenue and you've seen that in particular in sec lending to actually adjust our exposure levels. Now, we're trying to transact with our best clients as much as we used to before, but in some cases, we've had to be more calibrated. So we have literally, if we -- if you go down to the trading floor and the risk management team, they’ve literally had new parameters that they've installed that we've been operating at since late summer and early fall. 
So both of those give us some confidence that we can -- that we should be able to do better this year. The obvious unknown is the test itself, right, there's the macroeconomic shock, what's in that. There is global market trading bookshop, which has the counterparty piece to it. And then it's everything else in the test, including assumptions for balance sheet growth and so forth. And on those areas, we don't have any new information obviously won't until we see some of that in late this month or early next month and then we see the test come through in June.
Steven Chubak
Got it. And just one more follow up for me on capital optimization efforts, you continue to have a significant amount of preferred in your capital stack, certainly well in excess of many of your peers. I was hoping you could speak to your capacity or appetite to maybe redeem some of those preferreds and how we could possibly think about the timing of redemptions and the associated savings?
Eric Aboaf
Yeah. I think the way I would describe the capital stack is the capital stack is proportioned relative to how the current rules are written and implemented through CCAR, where the leverage ratios matter and so there's obviously an importance of having press in the stack. If that were to change, we'd obviously reconsider and so that would give us an opportunity to call or to adjust the alternative tier 1 component, which is the press. I do think though as we go into CCAR, our first priority is to return capital to our common equity holders, right. We're quite conscious of the -- of some of our dealer activity in our issuances this past year and we feel like the first priority is to get capital back to our common equity holders, as we go through the CCAR process this year.
Steven Chubak
And just one quick follow up relating to that common equity remark, just given the Fed’s willingness to greenlight payouts, north of 100%, the fact that they've clearly indicated that they're to have this binary pass fail outcome, given the context that you're having all the changes that you've made to reposition yourself ahead of CCAR, would you actually look in the near term and maybe exceed that 80% in order to more aggressively mitigate the dilution impact from CRD?
Eric Aboaf
We have said that we'd like to and we're optimistic that we can do better than 80%, so that's exactly the intention and intention and hope that we have and I'll just be clear that there is some of both that's necessary for that, but that is what we'd like to be able to deliver this year and we believe we've made some of the adjustments necessary at our end of the -- that are under our own control to effectuate that. So we're -- we'd like to be able to deliver on that, that would be our intention, given what we've -- how we're proceeding.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous.
Geoffrey Elliott
On the fee income guide, just to be clear first of all, the 3% to 4% down points to about 2.2 billion and then annualizing that, we kind of get to an annual run rate of about 8.8, if that was sustained, is that right?

Eric Aboaf
Yes, it's Eric. That's right. I mean, that's where we're trying to start with where we are today and we're trying to adjust for the markets, the flows, the limited amount of client transaction activity and then you have the lumpiness from trading, from 4Q to 1Q, right. So, we always want to be careful and appropriately conservative there. And then there's just the 606 effects of Charles River. So we’ve tried to factor all that in to our estimates.
And then we've said that, that's a good run rate for several quarters, we'd like that to be just a quarter or two, not very long, but we're trying to be careful here and to be honest, we're trying to be careful about revenues, because we think if we're doing that, then we're going to be even more effective and adroit in interventions on expenses and we think that's what we should demand of ourselves and what you would all expect of us.
I think the scenarios on revenue though are very wide to be honest, because there is a range of different market assumptions, flow assumptions and underlying transaction activity. We just have some -- we just have a little more visibility into the first quarter, including the usual adjustments on market flows, macroeconomics and a little bit of pricing, which tends to be a little deeper in the first quarter than the out quarters, just the way the calendar works and so we're just trying to factor that in, but off of that base, I think there's a range of scenarios and we'd obviously like to see more positive ones and if we see those, we've got to set a conference schedule set up in February and March and in May, we'll certainly update for changes.
Geoffrey Elliott
It sounds like in the sort of market assumptions that you're showing on slide 16, that could be a run rate that sticks around for a couple of quarters. Is that fair? I just want to make sure that we're understanding it right.
Eric Aboaf
Yeah. That could be the case and that's what we're calibrating our expense we’re up to.
Operator
Next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley, I’m sorry, JP Morgan.
Vivek Juneja
Hi. This is Vivek. Thanks. A couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, Eric, on CRD, the operating margin obviously in Q4, because of FAS 606 is a little bit inflated, what, on a full year basis, what would you guide us to as a sort of a more normalized operating margin, before you put in any cost savings or anything else?
Eric Aboaf
Vivek, I think we disclosed back in July an operating margin for that business at around 50% on the old ASC basis. I think the way the current year adjusts a bit, you might get for going from 605 to 606, just given the pattern of how -- what they've, how they've done the accounting historically versus now, you get a small uptick in margin from there. I think then the modeling becomes -- has probably two facets going in. One is the investments that we're making in the business and then the revenue ramp up, relative to those investments and that will tend to trend the margin rate down a bit, as we, in the early year, to building the business.
Vivek Juneja
Okay. All right, because while you cautioned us on not annualizing the revenues, I’m presuming the costs we can analyze, if we have modeling out CRD separately, right? Yeah. Okay. Different question. You called out in your NIM, one-time benefits from hedging activities, can you quantify that and is how much of that in the fourth quarter?
Eric Aboaf
Yeah. In the fourth quarter, it was about $6 million roughly and a little bit comes from some of the dislocation being swap markets, we've taken our swap positions down over the year as you know, but there's always some dislocations towards the, obviously over the holiday season in particular towards the end of the quarter. So we saw a little bit of that. And it was a positive dislocation, because of how the currencies between euro and some of the -- and yen actually played through, so that was a positive.

And then on long term debt, you get a little bit of this mark to market adjustment in the underlying accounting as you got rates and credit spreads move a little bit, so about 6 bucks and it will just, which won't reappear in the first quarter.
Vivek Juneja
Can I sneak in another one, which as you combined an accounting with FX and brokerage, I know a lot of -- part of brokerage used to have electronic FX trading, the rest of it, things like transition management, have they just diminished to a smaller base or has something else changed?
Eric Aboaf
No. I think what we're trying to do is literally simplify the disclosure and if we did something that took helpful materials away, we can certainly revisit, but we had a line that was historically called total trading services, which is both our direct foreign exchange trading plus our, what I'll call, electronic foreign exchange venues. Those were in what was called brokerage and then some of the other kind of fun connect, like our money market, electronic venue, a little bit of transition management and a few other smaller items like portfolio solutions. So we've just, I think, relabeled that total FX trading services, just to give it the kind of the description that's appropriate. I think within that, I'm just scanning through, about 80% percent of those revenues are foreign exchange related, the rest tend to be a little bit of the money market or portfolio solutions type activity.
Operator
And there are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
