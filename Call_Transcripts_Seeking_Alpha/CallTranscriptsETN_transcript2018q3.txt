Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric third-quarter 2018 earnings conference call. At this time all participants in a listen-only mode. My name is Brandon and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over your host for today's conference Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Communications please go ahead
Todd Ernst - General Electric Co.
Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to GE's third quarter earnings webcast. I'm joined this morning by our Chairman and CEO Larry Culp, and CFO Jamie Miller. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release, presentation, supplemental and 10-Q have been available since earlier today on our Investor website at www.ge.com. Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward-looking statements and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filing and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Larry. Larry.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Todd, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot to share with you, so let's get to it. During the third quarter, we saw positive results in most segments with outstanding performance in our Aviation (01:36-02:19)
Now, I know there's been renewed speculation on our future strategic direction. The strategy we announced on June 26 to create a more focused portfolio that sets up our businesses to win and strengthening our balance sheet is today the right plan going forward.
Consistent with this strategy, we are announcing two actions this morning. First, GE plans to reduce its quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.01 per share beginning with the board's next dividend declaration, which is expected to occur in December 2018. This change will allow GE to retain about $3.9 billion of cash per year compared to the prior payout level. Going forward, we will target a dividend payout ratio in line with peers over time.
Second, we will take a materially different approach to running our Power business. The past 30 days, I've spent a lot of time with Russell Stokes and his team. It has become clear to us that we need to simplify the business structure. Therefore, today, we are announcing our intent to reorganize Power into two units, both of which will report directly to me. The first is a unified Gas lifecycle business combining our product and services group gas power systems and power services with the second constituting the portfolio of Steam, Grid, Nuclear, and Power Conversion.
Additionally, we intend to consolidate the Power headquarters, Gas Power systems and Power Services teams into the new Gas lifecycle business, effectively eliminating the Power headquarters structure. We have much more to do to improve our performance in Power and we intend to move quickly to enhance our execution agility and improve our cost structure.

These actions are a start in bolstering GE for the road ahead. In the last month, I have visited many of our primary business locations. Getting to know this company better from the inside has only strengthened my conviction that GE has considerable strengths. The talent here is real. The technology is special. And the global reach of the GE brand and our relationships are truly impressive.
But GE needs to change. Our team knows this. In my old job, we acquired dozens of good but often underperforming businesses. And we always came prepared to convince the acquired teams that they and we needed to drive change. That is not the case here. Our GE team needs no convincing.
They really want direction to know how to change. And while I don't have all the answers after one month, I do have a few early impressions. We could use a lot more out and a good bit less up around here, meaning we need to focus more on customers and competition and, frankly, less on corporate.
We're going to strike a better balance between managing and reporting so that we ensure we're properly focused on the daily operating rhythms, which drive our actual financial results well ahead of our reporting cycles. Strong daily management makes reporting a lot easier. First things first
And we need to accelerate our progress on cash generation. Changes to our compensation system and internal reporting this year were a good start, but we need to operationalize real improvements on cash through business processes in every business, every day.
And with that, let me turn it to Jamie for a more detailed discussion of the quarter.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Thanks, Larry. I'll start with our consolidated quarterly performance. Orders were strong at $31.4 billion, up 7% reported and 13% organically. This was driven by equipment orders, which were up 22% organically and services up 5%. Revenues were down 4%, with Industrial revenues down 5%. Organically, Industrial revenues increased 1% driven by Renewables, Aviation, Healthcare, and Oil & Gas.
Industrial profit, which includes Corporate, was down 23% reported and 17% organically, driven by declines in Power and Renewables, partially offset by solid growth in Oil & Gas, Aviation and Transportation. Industrial profit margins were 8.1% in the quarter, down 180 basis points year-over-year on a reported and organic basis, driven by declines in Power and Renewables. Year-to-date, margins were down 50 basis points organically.
Net earnings per share was negative $2.62 which includes income from discontinued operations related to GE Capital. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.14 and I'll walk the GAAP continuing EPS to adjusted EPS on the right-hand side of the page. Starting from GAAP continuing EPS of negative $2.63, we had $0.01 of gains, principally from the sale of Value-Based Care, partially offset by held-for-sale marks in Lighting, Aviation and Power.
We also booked multiple impairments this quarter related to Power. The first was goodwill. As disclosed previously, we had a thin margin between fair value and carrying value for both Power Generation and Grid. And in the third quarter, both businesses failed their goodwill impairment test, which required us to fair value the assets of the businesses with any remaining value being allocated to goodwill.
The size of the charge results from the significant value associated with the unrecognized legacy assets, principally our profitable services backlog, long-standing customer relationships and our gas turbine technology. And the value of these assets essentially squeezed out any remaining room for goodwill.
Based on our best estimate, we booked a charge of $22 billion, $19 billion related to our Power Gen reporting unit and $3 billion related to Grid. Most of the $22 billion charge is related to the Alstom acquisition, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. We will true this up in the fourth quarter as it gets finalized.

Also, the SEC expanded the scope of its ongoing investigation to include the goodwill charge. The Department of Justice is also investigating this charge. And the other areas that we have previously reported are part of the SEC's investigation. We are cooperating with the SEC and DOJ as they continue their work on these matters.
On restructuring and other items, we had $0.05 of charges related to intangibles and long-lived assets in Power Conversion where we continue to restructure the business in the face of market challenges. We also incurred $0.06 of restructuring, principally in Corporate and Power, $0.02 of charges related to BD transactions and $0.01for our share of Baker Hughes GE's restructuring. Lastly, the remaining $0.01 related to an unrealized mark associated with our equity investment in Pivotal. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS was $0.14 in the quarter.
Moving to cash, adjusted Industrial free cash flow was $1.1 billion for the quarter and negative $300 million year to date. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $1 billion after adjusting for the $22 billion non-cash goodwill impairment. Working capital was negative $100 million for the quarter as we had a small build in inventory ahead of fourth quarter shipments offset by increased payables volume. Contract assets were a use of cash of $100 million, and we spent $900 million in gross CapEx or $600 million ex Baker Hughes GE.
On the right-hand side of the page, you can see the walk of the GE cash balance. We ended third quarter with $9.1 billion of cash in bank excluding Baker Hughes GE. And a few highlights: we generated cash proceeds of $3.2 billion related to businesses' positions, principally Industrial Solutions and Value Based Care. We assumed $6 billion of debt from GE Capital to fund the principal plan. And $2.4 billion of other cash includes investing activity in our Aviation business from the first half of the year, derivative settlements and FX on our cash, and a few other items.
While our businesses are generating cash flow along with expectations, it's clear that with respect to Power the issues will persist longer and with deeper impact than we had initially expected which will cause us to significantly miss our full year cash flow and earnings targets.
Next I'll discuss financial policy which reflects our strategic commitment to strength and delever the balance sheet. A solid rating is important to us, and we will target a sustainable credit rating in the single A range. S&P downgraded GE and GE Capital's credit rating from single A to BBB+ with a stable outlook on October 2, and Moody's and Fitch have our ratings on review.
The impact of the downgrade is manageable, and we were prepared for this. The most pronounced impact is on our commercial paper program. As you know, we have $40 billion of committed credit lines in place. We have tapped a portion of these revolvers and are currently transitioning our commercial paper program to a smaller size, and this is in line with our long term objective of reducing our reliance on commercial paper. We have sufficient liquidity to execute this transition smoothly.
We continue to target a leverage ratio of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA and expect to make substantial progress toward this goal in the next few years. As described in June, we have significant sources available to delever and de-risk the company. The action we announced today on the dividend is an example of strengthening our position.
We also continue to complete the remaining actions and transactions that are part of the $20 billion disposition program with an expected close of Distributed Power in the fourth quarter and Transportation by early 2019.
Now, I will turn to take you through the third quarter operating results by segment. Starting with Power, which has faced significant external and internal challenges, the market size continues to be in line with our previous expectations. But as we move into the second half it's clear that our previous forecasts were overly optimistic on the timing and level of deal closures on heavy-duty gas turbines and particularly on aeros. And while we are seeing some progress, we're not seeing the pace of operational improvement we expected. And we continue to see issues driven by our own execution and some on project execution with customers and partners.

Additionally, as Larry mentioned earlier, we're announcing our intent to reorganize the Power business into two units and are effectively eliminating the Power headquarters structure with an intent to enhance Power's execution agility, improve their cost structure and drive better outcomes.
Now with respect to the third quarter results for Power, orders were down 18% reported and down 3% organically. While Gas Power Systems orders were down 45% year to date, they were up 55% in the quarter based on easy comparison. We booked orders for 21 heavy-duty gas turbines, including five HAs. Aero orders for two units were down seven versus last year. Power Services orders were down 16% driven by tough comparison and a more disciplined deal selection process on the transactional fleet which is resulting in higher margins. CSA orders were flat.
Revenue was down 33% reported and down 20% organically. GPS revenue was down 55% on lower volume. Power Services revenue was down 4% with CSA's up 2% and transactional services down 12%.
While we're making progress commercially on the transactional fleet, the conversion time between orders and revenue has been longer than expected and CSA utilization was in line with expectations.
In the quarter, the business incurred an operating loss of $631 million, profitability was negatively impacted by charges in GPS related to challenges in project execution and liquidated damages. We also recorded $240 million of warranty and maintenance reserves related to the HA 9FB stage 1 blade issue.
We have a replacement blade in production and we're working proactively with our customers to schedule outages to replace the parts over time, but we also expect to incur a similar incremental amount of cost over time related to the blades as we perform planned outages in our services contracts.
Next on Aviation, which had another great quarter, orders were up 35%, equipment orders grew by 82% driven by continued strong momentum of the LEAP engine program, services orders grew 12%, revenues in the quarter grew 12%, equipment revenues were up 17% on commercial engines partially offset by lower military volume.
Specifically, we shipped 303 LEAP engines this quarter, up 192 units compared to last year. Services revenues grew 9% on higher shop visits and a spares rate of 28 million per day, up 20%. We continue to experience favorability and services with strength in air traffic driving high fleet utilization and spare parts consumption.
Segment profit was up 25% on higher volume, improved price and operating productivity. This was partially offset by negative mix from higher LEAP shipments. Operating profit margins expanded 240 basis points in the quarter. Year to date, we've shipped 739 engines and we're roughly four weeks behind on production as a result of the delays in material, but we remain committed to delivering 1,100 to 1,200 units. Aviation performance remains on track to deliver 15-plus percent op profit growth for the year.
Next on Healthcare, Healthcare orders were flat versus last year and up 3% organically. On a product-line basis, Life Sciences orders were up 6% organically with BioProcess up 9%, Healthcare Systems orders were up 2% organically. Geographically, organic orders were up 4% in Europe, driven by successful new product launches across Healthcare System. The U.S. was down 3% due to the non-repeat of a large Healthcare Systems government order. Emerging market organic orders were up 9% with China up 13%. And in China, we saw good performance in BioProcess, imaging and ultrasound.
Healthcare revenues of $4.7 billion grew 3% on an organic basis with Healthcare Systems up 3% and Life Sciences up 5%. Segment profit was up 2% on a reported basis and 10% organically, driven by volume and cost productivity partially offset by lower price. Margins expanded by 120 basis points organically. Consistent with our strategy to focus and win, the Healthcare team continues to prepare for separation.

On Renewables, orders were down 3% versus last year, driven by lower hydro orders. Onshore wind orders totaled $2.7 billion with U.S. equipment volume up 2.7 times and U.S. repower volume up 72%. International volume was down 66% on tough comps versus last year. Backlog at the end of the quarter totaled $16 billion and was up 17% from strength in onshore wind. Revenues were up 15% reported and 19% organically, mainly driven by onshore wind equipment, which was up 37%. This was partially offset by onshore wind repower volume, which was down 55%, primarily driven by timing, including delays for inclement weather and customer site readiness, as well as a number of new unit delivery delays driven by supply chain issues. The repower market remains robust and we're seeing continued strong demand through 2019 and beyond.
Segment profit was down 72% and margins were down 660 basis points, driven by significant pricing pressure and lower repower volume. We expect sequential improvement in our segment profit driven by higher wind turbine and repowering volume and continued product cost improvement. We will continue to monitor the supply chain and logistical issues as we ramp in fourth quarter for the higher volume.
Moving to Oil & Gas, Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning at 6:45, and Lorenzo and Brian will hold their earnings call with investors today at 9:00 AM.
Next, we provide the summary financial results for Transportation and Lighting, shown here, and additional information is available in the 10-Q.
Finally, on GE Capital, continuing operations generated net income of $19 million in the quarter, down $5 million from the prior year. Total year earnings will be affected by the timing of asset sales and related gains and losses. Additionally, the business may be impacted by updates to U.S. tax reform legislation and our assessment of the insurance reserves in the runoff insurance business which we perform annually in the fourth quarter.
GE Capital ended the quarter with $129 billion of assets, down $11 billion year to date, ex liquidity, and we remain focused on shrinking and deleveraging GE Capital, including improving its leverage profile. We expect to reduce GE Capital's commercial paper balance to zero in the fourth quarter of 2018 as we transition the overall company to a smaller CP program. And as it relates to capital contributions, we're monitoring tax reform, WMC and the fourth-quarter insurance reserves evaluation and we continue to evaluate derisking options for the portfolio.
At this point, we're planning at least $3 billion of capital contributions in 2019 and we'll continuously assess the capital adequacy and risk profile of GE Capital. GE Capital's resources are more limited as it shrinks and GE may need to support GE Capital further, if necessary, either to achieve desired capital levels or to execute strategic options around its portfolio.
There was a new insurance accounting standard issued in August of 2018. We're evaluating the effect of the standard and anticipate its adoption will materially affect our financial statements when it takes effect in 2021.
Now, I'll turn it back to Larry.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Jamie, thanks. Right now, I'm spending most of my time with the Power business with real help from Jamie and our Vice Chair, David Joyce. We need to establish a realistic outlook there, particularly for the Gas business, and drive improvements from there. The moves we've announced today, in addition to the daily, weekly and monthly operating disciplines we are instilling, will drive transparency and accountability on the path to improved operating performance. When we have our arms around this, we will provide you with our outlook in 2019.

As I mentioned earlier, we also intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy and are committed to strengthening and delevering the balance sheet over the next few years. In summary, GE has and will continue to have a strong commitment to all its stakeholders. We are making GE a stronger company operationally and financially. I'm truly excited to lead this storied company into its next chapter. I've spent my career improving strong franchise businesses and taking them from good to great. We know what to do. Now is the time to execute.
Before we go to Q&A, I want to acknowledge the pent-up demand for information that you have on a range of topics, but I've been in this job for all of 30 days. I will share with you what I know and can today, but please know that I'll be back to you with more definitive plans and views in the months ahead.
In closing, I also want to thank John Flannery for his 30 years of exceptional service to this company. John also made a number of important contributions as CEO. I have the utmost respect for John and wish him nothing but the best going forward.
With that, Todd, back to you.
Todd Ernst - General Electric Co.
Thanks, Larry. Brandon, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And from Vertical Research we have Jeffrey Sprague. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Hey, Jeff. Good morning.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Good morning. Larry, best of luck. Hey, my first question, and I think it's everyone's question really, is the balance sheet here. And just wondering as you're sitting there with your fiduciary hat on looking at an unstable, perhaps, global economic environment, certainly relative to what the market's telling us, do you see the need to move more quickly on the balance sheet?
Is there something with these lawsuits or something that tie your hands on moving with the balance sheet? Could you just give us a little bit more color on how you might move to more quickly lift the cloud and stabilize things here?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Jeff, let me take that, and then Jamie probably has some perspectives as well. I think we're mindful of the morphing environment, but perhaps more mindful of our leverage situation today. So, coming in as a Director earlier in the year, that was clear. All the more true today as Chairman and CEO. I think what we've tried to do throughout the course of the year is move as briskly but smartly as we possibly can. The dividend move today, to me, fundamentally straightforward, given our desire to preserve that cash to help delever the business. We have a lot of options. We laid these out, I think, in some detail back in June. Certainly, the strategy that we talked about relative to derisking and focusing the portfolio is very much intact today. How we move through those various options, the timing, the pace, the sequencing, something very much on the table to make sure that we tend to the balance sheet as quickly as we can. We don't want to be rushed. We don't want to be rash, but we need to get after this straightaway and I hope today's move on the dividend is evidence of that intent in action.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yeah, and the only other thing I would add, Jeff, you mentioned lawsuits. There really is no consideration around that in terms of something that would be a constraint to that plan.
Operator
And from JPMorgan, we have Steve Tusa, please go ahead.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Hey, Steve. Good morning.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Hey. Good morning, Larry. So, I guess as a fresh voice in the room there, you guys kind of addressed the insurance thing, that seems like it's going to be a little bit bigger than expected but there's been a lot of information coming out from these disclosures from the shareholder lawsuits that talks about the accounting for LTSAs and contract assets. Several whistleblowers out there talking about the behavior in the past. I'm wondering, in your seat, if you've really delved into that and you're comfortable enough there to unequivocally rule out the need for more capital and specifically the potential for an equity raise?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Steve, there are a number of questions there. Let me try to take them in order. Let me state in a straightforward fashion, we have no plans for an equity raise. I think with respect to the service business within Power, this is a good opportunity for us to frankly manage this franchise better than we have. I've been encouraged by what I've seen at the operational level. Clearly there are a lot of issues from the past that the team is dealing with but the opportunity here to work closely with our customers around this installed base and do so in a way that's a win-win for them and for us I think it's clear. I'm excited about this. Now it's not a business in the state that it should be in, or could be in, will be in, but I think a good bit of the time we've spent with Russell and Scott and the team has been very much geared toward putting those improvements in motion. I think as we exit this year, go into next year, at the operational level look for continued progress there.
Operator
And from Melius Research, we have Scott Davis. Please go ahead.
Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Hey, Scott. Good morning.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Hi, Scott.
Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC
Welcome, Larry, and good luck to you. It's not going to be an easy job, got a lot to fix. I wish you the best of luck.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Well, I appreciate that Scott.
Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC
Better you than me.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Any time you want to join us, let me know but I'm excited to be here. This is an outstanding company right. The people here I think are strong. The technology again is impressive and in 30 days I've begun to appreciate all the more the reach and the impact this company has around the world. We can do better than where we are today, but this is an important company and I'm pleased to be on the team.
Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC
We're glad to have you. But anyway so, my question really is on the business model at GE, it's so different than Danaher. The two biggest businesses, Power and aircraft engines, the company is willing to sell the unit at a big loss in hopes of capturing the spare parts and that seems to be working in aerospace but doesn't seem to be working in Power. Can you fix Power without fixing how you go to market traditionally? Does something drastically need to change there?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Well, Scott, it's hard to say that we don't need dramatic or drastic change in a business that is performing the way that Power is, right? I mean, in some respects, it's that simple. So, in my mind, beyond compliance and quality, everything is on the table at Power and I think Russell and the team would echo that if they were the call. There's no question that in my prior life I was really on the periphery of both the Power space and aerospace as well.
Certainly, in the heart of Healthcare, but I'm of the view that there's a lot that I've done previously that's relevant as I join this team. I've driven a lot of change. Every time we brought a new company in, we were driving a lot of change. That was effectively the value proposition for our investors and I think over time we were able to do that. That change really comes as a function of revisiting assumptions, clarifying strategy, putting the right team together, driving operations day in, day out and clearly deploying capital in and around that business as appropriate.

But in a more fundamental level, Scott, it's really about expectations, right? It's about making sure that problems are surfaced and solved and managing in a substantive not superficial way. I think all that's relevant. But to be clear, this isn't about me. This is about the 300,000 people on the payroll, myself included, that want and are committed to having GE in a better place and performing better, both for our customers and for shareholders.

From Citi, we have Andrew Kaplowitz. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Good morning, guys
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Andrew, good morning.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Hey, Andrew.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Larry or Jamie, obviously, you didn't give us EPS or cash guidance for the year, but industrial free cash flow in Q3 was arguably not as bad as feared. You did say that you would significantly miss your previous cash flow and earnings target for the year. How should we think about GE's ability to generate earnings and especially cash in what seasonally is usually a strong Q4. And then, really more importantly, when we think about next year, are there any guide posts you would give us at this point as you review the businesses, Larry? Should the Power business in particular be less of a drag on cash in 2019?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yeah. So, let me take the first discussion on that one. So, as you noted, we're not offering updated guidance right now. But as we look at the businesses, we see real strength in Healthcare and in Aviation. And in Power, we just are seeing continued impacts from the lower market penetration I talked about. Deal closure delays and uncertainties and just other operational and project execution issues, and we do see those continuing into 2019.
But as we pull back, fourth quarter, as you referenced, has always been a significant volume quarter for GE and we expect this fourth quarter to be the same. Again, with strong volume in units at Aviation, Healthcare, Renewables and at Power, and Power is also back-end loaded historically, which is another reason that as we really look at Power and the visibility we have there, both with respect to the market and the operations, we're positioning our views on that right now the way we are
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Andrew, Larry here. I hope that you and others will appreciate that when we talk about numbers on a forward-looking basis, we want to do so with conviction and confidence. I don't want to fool you, let alone myself, in thinking 30 days in that I can give you that today. So, with respect to the quarter and certainly the outlook for next year, there'll be a time and place for that. But make no mistake, we know that the Power business has to perform better and that is what we're going to spend a ton of time on once we get past earnings today.
Operator
Thank you. From Deutsche Bank, we have Nicole DeBlase. Please go ahead
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Larry.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Good morning, Nicole
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, I guess maybe we could talk a little bit about Power. So, just based on the actions that you're announcing today, is there any sense of the level of savings that those like the headquarter consolidation could actually drive, just to give us a sense of what the baseline of savings could be as we move into 2019?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Nicole, I think what we've done today is really share both internally and publicly the organizational architecture, if you will, that we have in mind. There are a number of details that Russell, the team and I will be working through in the days and weeks to come. And as those details become more clear, we'll share those first internally, and then we will share them with you and others publicly.

So give us a little bit of time to work through that. I think in the interim we want to leave that open. But I would just underscore that while there is an opportunity to improve our cost structure, dare I say it, imperative given our current performance, a good bit of what we are talking about here is also geared toward running the businesses better. I think by consolidating the headquarters and really putting that support around the Gas business, we'll all have a better line of sight on the action day-to-day in that business and be able to make decisions I think more crisply with more transparency and more accountability.
Having the rest of that Power portfolio coming in directly as well through a different path will give us an opportunity to see those P&Ls clearly without any noise and work business by business to drive improvements there. And I think that's a better way for us to operate. We can come together and do things together that make sense, but we're going to make sure that we're maximizing and optimizing those individual businesses first.
Operator
From Barclays, we have Julian Mitchell. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Good morning.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Good morning, Julian
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Good morning, Julian.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good morning. Maybe my question would be around GE Capital. Jamie, you had talked about more work to be done looking at the liabilities relating to tax, WMC, insurance and so on. Obviously that will set alarm bells ringing given the scale of miscalculations at things like insurance and so forth. So maybe just give us an update on how sizable you think some of these liabilities might be? Is there a risk that they do end up similar to the scale of the insurance adjustment earlier in the year?
And also related to that, maybe I missed it, but I didn't see any reiteration of the $25 billion capital asset sale plan by the end of 2019, so I just wondered if you have an update on the pace of those asset exits at Capital?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Sure. So with respect to the first piece, at this point we see at least $3 billion of capital contributions into GE Capital, as I mentioned. We continue to shrink GE Capital, and we still are on our plan for $25 billion of asset reductions. To date we've seen asset reductions via sale of about $7 billion. You saw $11 billion down on the balance sheet. A lot of that is just seasonal timing and some other shifting. And we do expect to see another big tranche be sold in the fourth quarter, so well on track there.
And then with respect to the other elements we're monitoring, it's a little bit of a moving target. We monitor tax reform. We've got some interpretations we expect to either be cleared up or sent out in the fourth quarter. That could cause some tax adjustments in the fourth quarter for GE Capital. WMC is something we continue to monitor, and then our annual fourth quarter insurance evaluation as well. With respect to that, we just reset that last year, as you mentioned. And interest rates are up more than planned, which is helpful, but it's a process we go through. And it's something we're monitoring.
And I'd say when I look out in 2019, 2020 and beyond, GE Capital's resources are just more limited as it shrinks, so GE may need to support GE Capital further if necessary. And when we think about either achieving desired capital levels, derisking debt maturities, those are the kinds of things we're thinking about. But right now as we look at 2019, we see the three things I mentioned as the monitoring point.

Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, Larry. So you mentioned obviously the portfolio plan laid out in June remains the base case, and that profile plan's key levers in delevering and derisking balance sheet. Can you just give us an update on the timing on the moving pieces for Baker Hughes and GE Healthcare? That's the first part of my question. And the second part would be, you've obviously spent most of your time so far with Power. Obviously, Power results this quarter were less than – obviously, well below what we expected. Can you maybe just quantify what those onetime items were hitting the P&L this quarter? And how you see the path of cost reduction in Power progressing? Thank you.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Sure. Sure. Nigel, I would say with respect to the strategy, again, what we're reinforcing today is the strategic framework that we highlighted in June with respect to derisking and delevering the balance sheet and really setting the businesses up to win and, in some cases, businesses in an independent form. You mentioned Healthcare. We talked about that back in the summertime. Today, I don't think we really have much to say relative to Baker Hughes. They've got their earnings call here shortly.
I think what we can say is that our intent, as expressed in June, holds and that you should expect us, in an orderly fashion over several years, to implement that objective. I think with respect to Healthcare, we're still of the view that Healthcare operating in an independent form is probably what is best for that business and that team. Might the timing and sequencing there change relative to some other things that we're working on, too early to tell, but it's certainly something that Kieran [Murphy] and I have been talking about.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yeah, and I'll jump in here on Power, you asked about the negative Op profit in the quarter and some of the different charges. So I talked through earlier the goodwill and the Power Conversion intangibles. Focusing on Power operations, in the quarter, we had $240 million of charges on the blade issue with respect to warranty and maintenance reserves. We saw about $400 million of project reserves and other execution issues and about $150 million of just some other execution issues. We saw lower volume in the quarter and if you really put that back together, Power probably came in about as expected operationally, with the exception of these charges that are incrementally flowing through.

Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Covered a lot of territory so far and maybe some broad brush questions for you, Larry. First would be, what do you think are the – 30 days in, the biggest misperceptions that people on the outside have right now about GE? And then related is, you're coming in from the outside and you're basically on unfamiliar ground. You're surrounded by senior managers who didn't grow up with DBS, don't know the playbook. How are you set with building out your team, basically your inner circle of advisers?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Sure. Well, let me take those in order. The biggest misperceptions, Deane, there are a lot of people around GE that know the company far better than I do, right. In this role for 30 days, on the board for less than a year, I won't claim any special expertise but, again, I think as you get into the business, I have been truly impressed with the talented people I've met really around the world. This team's been through a lot the last several years. The company perhaps doesn't enjoy the reputation in certain quarters that it once did. But people here are committed to embracing that reality and changing it. And I take a lot of comfort and strength from that.

Frankly, I'm not sure when my board colleagues came to me, that I would've stepped into this role hadn't I been out on the road over the course of the summer. Visiting our business and our team in China, getting the opportunity to walk a couple of plants in Power, getting out with David Joyce and the Aviation team and really seeing the strengths of GE that go a bit perhaps underappreciated today.
And I don't want that to sound like I'm sugar-coating our reality. This is not a quarter that we're particularly proud of, but, that said, Aviation knocked the cover off the ball and Healthcare wasn't too far behind, Transportation in a good place. We really like what we're going to do strategically there with the merger.
So there are good things going on here. That doesn't necessarily take away from today's headlines, but there are things we can do to build on, this team, these assets, these strengths and that's what we're going to do.
With respect to the team, Deane, you and I both know, we share a passion for the local ballclub here. Alex Cora just won a World Series, as best I can tell, largely with the team that was on the field a year ago that didn't do so well. So I am listening to a lot of people here in these first weeks. That will continue, listening, learning. But again, I feel good about the group that we have here and we're committed to building a stronger General Electric.

From Bank of America Merrill Lynch we have Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Good morning. We've been getting a lot of question on GE Capital, particularly the aircraft leasing business. Can you just walk us through what you guys are seeing in terms of book value of the assets? And just a broader question, as you look at GE Capital and as you sort of make a statement about no capital raise, does that mean that you feel that GE Capital – you are comfortable with where GE Capital values are or are you saying that, look, I'm only in for 30 days and it's going to take us a while to get through those? So just two-part question. Thank you.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yes. Andrew, on GECAS, I would say with respect to asset values there, we're not seeing anything unusual come through. We can work with you through more offline to give you more specifics if there are specific questions on that. And then with respect to the discussion about an equity raise, I'm not sure I have anything more to add to what Larry said before.

Larry, if I think back to when Dave Cote took over Honeywell and Ed Breen took over Tyco in similarly difficult times and you've got Capital, the thing that's striking the most to me is at least these expanded investigations that came out today and the ongoing question about faith in the numbers that you've got to base your decisions on. So just trying to get a sense for what is giving – where are you in kind of your continuum of getting confidence into the underlying numbers that are at the core of basing the rest of the decisions on?
And just before I go, if you can also just address Healthcare. You're saying it's very strong. Just seemed a little flat in terms of the growth up 3%. The rest of the segment peers seem to be doing a little bit better, a little confidence there, too, would be helpful. Thanks.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Yes. Steve, I would say with respect to my discovery work here and beginning to kick things into gear, it's early, but where I'm focused primarily is what we can change going forward in terms of the trajectory and the underlying performance. I think part of what we need to do at Power is wring out a little bit of the undue optimism that I think we referenced in our prepared remarks so that we can establish a baseline that we can build on, a baseline, frankly, for our own internal processes, let alone when we're talking about the business on the outside.

In that regard, again, it's early, but I have conviction that there are things to build upon, there are improvements that are well within our reach and we just need to do that. And that's – again, it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take some time, but I'm hopeful that we can build that credibility, deliver that performance over time.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Hey, Steve. And just a quick comment on Healthcare, as you asked about. Healthcare revenues were up 3% on an organic basis. We saw segment profit up 10%, a consistent basis. And when you really peel back the layers, we're seeing very consistent growth across the different regions, as well as in the product line.
U.S. was down a bit this quarter. We expected to have tough comps again in the fourth quarter, but largely driven to big orders we had last year from the VA in the U.S. China strength continues. And what the business is really doing well is getting a really nice mix of growth in the market coupled with strong cost control and a real steady focus on how they're investing in R&D, so nice profile
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
And Steve, just to be clear, I think we're well aware that Aviation really was the standout force in the third quarter of this year. My comments about the strength of the Healthcare business were not rooted into the last 90 days but really looking at that business on a prospective basis. I think it's an outstanding business there, well positioned in a number of attractive submarkets, and we intend to grow that going forward.

John Walsh - Credit Suisse
Hi. So I wanted to actually talk about Aviation because that was clearly a source of strength in the quarter, and you reiterated your view of 15% plus on the OP line there. So that does imply sequentially that the margins are lighter. Obviously there is the LEAP ramp, or there's higher LEAP in Q4. But as we think about that longer term because it will be a big driver of the future GE, do you still believe the construct of holding the margins while you ramp LEAP is the right way to think about that business? Or has anything changed there?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yeah. I'll give a little bit of context on the quarter, the year and just a macro level. In the quarter, we just continue to see real underlying strength in the business. Global passenger travel up 6.8% year-to-date, passenger load factors at all-time high, which just means our engines are just flying more, which means we bill more hours under services contracts, we consume more parts as they go in for maintenance.
We are seeing negative mix as the LEAP volume ramps. This has been partially offset by nice improvement in LEAP product cost and at services, like I mentioned, just a very strong spares rate and just strong spare part consumption on our T&M contracts.
Peeling back and looking forward, we do see CFM coming down, but it's more than offset by military being stronger, the LEAP cost curve really coming down over the next few years and the services strength continuing. We expect to see continued healthy growth there, particularly as CFM continues to work its way through the services cycle. So backlog, strong revenue growth, air miles, strong services growth, and LEAP coming down the cost curve is probably the way to think about it.

From Goldman Sachs, we have Joe Ritchie. Please go ahead.

H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.

Good morning, Joe.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Hi, Joe.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So just a couple quick clarifications. Jamie, on the net leverage target, I didn't see you guys explicitly call out 2020, but you did mention in the next few years. Has that 2.5 times changed at all from a timing perspective? And then the second question, in just thinking about the comments around GE needing to support Capital beyond the $3 billion in capital infusion in 2019, is the new insurance policy going to make you revisit the $15 billion capital outlay over the next few years?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
So with respect to the first question on the net debt to EBITDA, we intend to reach net debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times. We plan to achieve that over time with substantial progress through 2020. That's really how we're thinking about that right now.
With respect to the – and I assume you're talking about the insurance accounting standard – that is something that, as I said, we expect will have a material impact on the financial statements. Not effective until 2021. It requires more granularity around loss testing. It changes the discount rate assumptions. And we'll evaluate that over the next couple of years, but it does not impact the statutory reserve accounting. And that is really what drives the capital funding requirements for insurance.

Hey, John.
John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Hi, guys. Jamie, what was the Capital stranded debt at the end of the third quarter? And as a follow-up, what would you say is the actual free cash of the businesses that we've committed to selling to try to discern what could be some sort of a normalized cash rate, say once working capital and restructuring balance? So I guess there's rail, ambulance, Distributed Power, Industrial Solutions. Is there any way to put that into a context?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yes. We've said before that the free cash flow of the businesses that we're selling is a little over $1 billion, about $1.2 billion in free cash flow. So that's some sizing there. And with respect to excess debt, pay-downs in 2018 will be $7 billion; 2019, we expect that to be about $9 billion and then we've got long-term debt maturities in 2020 in GE Capital of $16 billion and it's really a question there of issuances that might offset that. So that might give you a little bit of sizing there.

Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Yes. Just wondering as you look at GE Capital overall and the GECAS asset, curious if you see net positive value of the GE Capital balance sheet and earnings power here and if we should think of potentially selling GECAS as a silver bullet to shore up what might come with the accounting standard change in insurance and if you will not wait until 2021 to answer that rather than leave it as an overhang?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
GECAS is a really strong business. Over the years, it's, I think, demonstrated its strength in terms of its risk and its underwriting and how it performs with low loss ratios over time. We think it's really advantaged because of its knowledge of the underlying assets.

And due to that, we receive inbounds on this business all the time. We think it's a valuable franchise. We have not made any decisions or have plans right now to do anything with GECAS, but certainly that's something, as we think about the timing and pace of execution on our overall plan, that is something we could think about.

Are there other plans on the asset sale side within Industrial? There have been some sort of news reports about potential asset sales beyond the ones already announced.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
We've got our $20 billion disposition plan in motion. We've executed a number of those already this year. Distributed Power, as I mentioned, is on track to be sold in the fourth quarter. Transportation's on track for the first quarter. We do have a few Aviation businesses and Current and Lighting that we're still well underway in those processes. So those will likely come through as well.
Beyond that, I think it really gets back to Larry's comments on Baker Hughes and Healthcare and a planned, orderly separation over time with Baker Hughes and over time, a separation of Healthcare as well.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Eaton Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the call now to, Mr. Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for today for Eaton's third quarter 2018 earnings call. As all of you that are on the call have noticed, today our call is occurring at 11 AM versus our traditional 10 start. We moved our call today to allow those of you who follow Cummins to participate in their call, which occurred at 10 AM this morning. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.
Our agenda today as typical includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the performance in the third quarter along with our outlook for 2018 and a preliminary look at 2019. As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.
The press release from the earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of this call is going to be available on our website and will be available for replay after the earnings is complete.
Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to forward-looking future results of the company and are therefore by definition forward-looking statements. The actual results can differ from those forecasted projections due to a range of items covered in the uncertainties covered in our press release, presentation and on the 8-K.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Okay. Thanks, Don. Hey, let me begin with a quick summary of our Q3 results. And overall it was a solid quarter where our balance across multiple end markets really allowed the company to deliver strong results and so we're really pleased with our Q3 results.
Earnings per share of $0.95 on a GAAP basis or $1.43 excluding the impact of the arbitration decision we previously announced in August. This is towards the upper end of our guidance range of $1.35 to $1.45 and up 14% above prior year, excluding naturally the gain from the JV that we formed last year in Q3. Our sales were $5.4 billion, up 4%, and this was comprised of 6% organic growth offset by 1% each from both currency and some small divestitures we had during the course of last year.
We're very pleased with our strong margin performance, which included an all-time record margins of 17.6%. Our teams really executed well, which led to all-time record margins in three of our segments including; Electrical Products, Electrical Systems & Services, and Aerospace. And finally, we produced solid operating cash flows of $1 billion in the quarter.

On page 4, we compare our performance of the quarter versus prior year and I'll just highlight a couple of items here. Notice that sales were up 4% and strong execution, segment operating margins were up 120 basis points over prior year and we posted 11% increase in segment operating profits.
We did have two unusual items impacting the year-over-year comparisons, the gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in Q3 2017 and the expenses from the arbitration decision in Q3 2018. Excluding these items, net income was also up 11%.
On page 5, we summarize the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenues were flat with organic growth of 1%, offset by 1% currency. And I'll just note here that revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by the Lighting business. As we discussed in prior calls, in the Lighting business organic revenues declined slightly in the quarter, in line with declines that we've seen in Q2 and excluding Lighting, Electrical Products had 3% organic growth. In the quarter, we saw revenue strength in North America with particular strength and solid growth in the industrial end markets.
We had expected our Lighting sales to turn positive in the quarter and we do believe this will happen next quarter. This assumption is also supported by the growth that we saw in our orders during the course of Q3. Overall orders increased 3% for the segment with solid growth in industrial and residential markets in North America. And our backlog is up some 16% over last year. So we're pleased to see the really strong strength and building backlogs during the course of the quarter. Segment operating profits increased 4%, with operating margins up 70 basis points to once again an all-time record of 19.2%.
On page 6, we outline the results of our Electrical Systems & Services segment. Organic growth was 9% in the quarter, an acceleration from Q2, which was up 7% and Q1 which was up 2%. Foreign exchange and the divestiture of a small joint venture each reduced revenues by 1% in the quarter. We saw strength in industrial markets and data centers and geographically we saw strength in North America and also in the Asia-Pacific region. Bookings were up 4% with strong growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and with data center orders up double-digit globally.
We did see a degree of caution in late September in U.S., especially in large project orders. We've seen this kind of caution in the past on periods of economic uncertainty and so we do think that impacted our orders a bit in the quarter and at the end of the month of September. Notably, our backlog was up 12% versus last year. Operating margins of 15.4% were up 160 basis points and were an all-time record for the segment.
On page 7, we cover our Hydraulics segment. Here revenues were up 6%, 7% organic growth offset by 1% from currency. We had strength with multiple OEMs in both construction and ag markets and also in the distribution channel. Orders increased 4% with geographic strength in Asia and in the Americas, and this is on top of very strong comps from Q3 of 2017 which were up some 22% last year. So we saw end market strength in both construction and also in agriculture – with agriculture OEMs.
Geographically, orders were up 12% in the Americas, up 9% in Asia and down 16% in EMEA. Similar to last quarter, orders in EMEA were down due to largely reduced lead times. Our shorter lead times and better delivery performance continues to reduce the need for customers to place long-dated orders in the Europe market. Our Europe orders for deliveries in the three month period, so those shorter lead-time orders, were actually up again this quarter. We continue to have a strong backlog, which was up 24% from last year, operating profits increased 18% and our margins were 14% and 140 basis point improvement over last year.

Next on page 8, we summarize Aerospace's performance in the quarter. The Aerospace segment accelerated nicely from 6% organic growth in Q2 to 9% growth in Q3. In the quarter we saw strength across many platforms including military fighters, rotorcraft, regional jet, biz jets, and in both military and commercial aftermarket, so really broad-based strength in our Aerospace business. Orders remained strong in the quarter, up 12%, with particular strength in commercial transport, commercial aftermarket, as well as in military rotorcraft.
Our backlog is also up strongly, up some 15% in the quarter. And operating leverage here was really outstanding with profits increasing 25% to an all-time record. Margins of 22% and up some 280 basis points over prior year. In addition to solid execution, I will acknowledge as well that we had favorable mix in the quarter, which positively impacted margins, largely as a result of strength in the commercial aftermarket business which grew faster than the overall segment.
Moving to page 9 in the Vehicle segment, in Q3, our organic growth was 7%, and this organic growth was offset by 3% from FX and 2% from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture last year. The NAFTA Class 8 market continues to perform well. We've increased our production forecast for 2018 from 295,000 units to 320,000 units and this is being offset somewhat by weakness in light vehicle markets in China and a bit in Europe as well. Operating profits increased 11% while operating margin stepped up 140 basis points to 18.9%. Overall, another very strong quarter in our Vehicle business.
And wrapping up our segment summaries, we move to the eMobility segment on page 10. Organic growth was 7%. As anticipated we're ramping up our R&D investment in this business and therefore segment margins stepped down to 12.5%, which is really in line with our full year margin guidance for the segment. In Q3 we secured an additional contract win for a new eMobility program, which reinforces our optimism for this fast-growing market. And we're also currently in discussions with a large number of additional customers and so our long-term growth outlook for this segment remains quite optimistic.
Now moving to page 11. With three quarters behind us and heading into the final quarter of the year, we're fine-tuning our segment expectation for 2018 for both organic revenue growth and for operating margin. Our end markets continue to experience solid growth; we're reaffirming both our full-year organic growth target of 6% and our operating margins of between 16.4% and 17%.
While the overall organic growth expectation remains unchanged, we are adjusting our growth estimates for four of the segments. In Electrical Products, we're adjusting it down by a half a basis point (sic) [half a point] (11:01) from 3% to 2.5%, and this is mostly due to softness in Lighting, which we say – think has extended one quarter longer than what we originally anticipated. But with orders turning positive in Q3, we're really confident that this headwind for the segment has now abated and we expect to see better growth going forward.
We're also reducing Hydraulics down 1% from 13% to 12%. We had previously raised our outlook in Q1 from 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength in orders over the last 18 months, so this change from 12% to 13% we think reflects just some fine-tuning with three quarters behind us now.
We're also raising our revenue outlook in two segments. We're taking Aerospace up 2%, from 6% to 8% for the year, really on broad-based strength in a number of our end markets, and for Vehicle, we're raising our organic growth forecast by 1%, reflecting the increased production levels in NAFTA Class 8 market in 2018, moving it from 295,000 to 320,000 units.

For segment operating margins, we're fine-tuning some of the targets in a number of the segments, but overall, segment margins for Eaton overall remain unchanged. So we think a strong year of conversion.
And just turning to page 12, we've taken an opportunity here to summarize our thoughts around our raw material cost and tariffs. As we outlined in Q2, we expect the tariff impact for 2018 to be modest, and as background, it's important to note that we do manufacture in zone of currency, and as a result, we don't have large material flows that would disproportionally be affected by tariffs. Where we are affected we've been focused on taking both price increases and operational actions to ensure that we stay ahead of this issue and our performance today certainly reflects this in the margin strength that we're delivering in our businesses.
As we look to 2019, we remain confident in our ability to mitigate the latest round of tariff impacts with both pricing actions and other supply chain changes. As we take a look at the latest round of 301 tariffs that have been now finalized, we expect about $110 million of additional tariff cost in 2019 and we are in the midst of taking actions now that will ensure that the tariff related cost increases are once again fully offset by pricing and other additional supply chain changes. And so we're confident as we look forward just as we look backward that we have plans in place to fully mitigate any tariff related cost increases.
And next on the next page, we provide our Q4 guidance, and an updated guidance on the full year. For Q4, we expect EPS of $1.38 to $1.48 and this assumes 6% organic growth, it assumes margins of between 17% and 17.4% and a tax rate of between 12.5% and 13.5%. And as we take a look at the full year for 2018, for the third time this year, we're increasing the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance to a range of $5.30 to $5.40. This naturally excludes the arbitration decision impact. The midpoint of our EPS guidance is increasing 1% from $5.30 to $5.35. We now expect corporate expenses to be $20 million above 2017 levels compared to $10 million that we previously noted and this is largely the result of slightly higher interest expenses.
The tax rate for 2018 is now expected to be between 11% and 12%, reflecting really the impact of the arbitration decisions in Q3 that we noted earlier. And consistent with prior guidance, we're expecting operating cash flows of between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion. This does exclude the $300 million impact from the arbitration decision in Q3, and also unchanged, our free cash flow is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, once again, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision.
Our assumptions for CapEx and restructuring costs are unchanged from prior guidance. However, certainly given the recent pullback in the stock market, we would expect our share repurchases to range from $800 million to $1 billion for the full year and year-to-date our share repurchases have been roughly $600 million. So we'll certainly view this is a buying opportunity given the pullback that we've seen recently.
Lastly, at the midpoint of our EPS guidance, we would expect to generate 2018 EPS growth of roughly 15% excluding the impact of the arbitration decision and the 2017 gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins JV and the income arising from the 2017 tax bill.
Hey, just turning to page 14, and I know this is one of the big questions that's on everybody's mind, during last quarter's earnings call we provided a view of our key end markets and really split by three categories, parts of our businesses that we were basically in the early to mid-part of the growth stage, those that were in the middle part of the growth stage and the late stage of growth. And our conclusion then is still our conclusion today, the majority of our businesses are in the early to mid-part of the economic growth cycle. While we do expect the rate of growth to slow somewhat, given the strong 2018 results. We also anticipate that we'll see solid growth in 2019. This view of our end markets is consistent with our initial outlook for 2019 and our assumption that our end markets will grow between 3% and 4% next year.

And just turning the page 15, while we provide specific guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January – we will provide specific guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January, we thought it would be helpful also to share some high-level assumptions around 2019. As I noted, we think our end markets will grow 3% to 4%. At this point in the cycle we'd expect incremental margins on core growth to be between 25% and 30% and this does include any impact associated with tariffs. And our preliminary estimate on corporate costs, including pension, interest and other corporate, suggests that they'll be flat with 2018. We expect our tax rate to be between 14% and 15%, consistent with our expected long-term tax rate, and lastly we continue to see opportunities for attractive returns and restructuring opportunities and we anticipate restructuring spending for 2019 will be generally in line with 2018.
So with that, I'll turn the meeting back over to Don Bullock and we're happy to answer any questions that you may have.

Before I have the operator provide you with instructions for the Q&A, I did want to note that we do have a number of individuals in the queue for questions today. Given our time constraints of an hour and our desire to get as many of these questions as possible addressed, please limit your questions to a question and a follow-up. Thanks in advance. With that, I'll turn over to the operator to provide you with instructions for the Q&A.

Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our first question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Craig, I was wondering if you could actually address capital deployment a little bit more directly, and what you're thinking. The spirit I'm asking the question is what seems some plausible speculation you guys were poking around at Esterline. I don't expect you to address that specifically, but maybe you could give us some thoughts on what your appetite is for bigger deals and how you might kind of play that card as we look into 2019?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. Thanks, Jeff, certainly appreciate the question, and as you noted, we don't comment on any potential acquisitions. I would say that our capital deployment strategy is largely unchanged with where we've been. We've said that our first priority in our call on cash is going to be invest in our businesses and to invest in organic growth, and we continue to see really lots of tremendous opportunities to do that.
We'll continue to pay a very healthy dividend and buy back shares, and in this environment, as I noted, we'll certainly be much more aggressive in buying back our shares where we think this is a tremendous buying opportunity, and we'll generate a lot of cash over the next several years, and we have the opportunity to deploy that cash in certainly value-creating acquisitions, and there we've said our priorities continue to be in our Electrical business, in our Aerospace business, and also in our new eMobility segment.
But having said that, what we've said all along as well, we are not going to lose our pricing discipline, that we have a very structured approach to the way we take a look at deals and those opportunities, and we think our cost of capital is 8% to 9%, and we talk about delivering a minimum of 300 basis points over the cost of capital. And so we intend to remain very disciplined as we take a look at opportunities and how we price them, recognizing that we always have an opportunity to go out and buy our stock back and essentially create tremendous shareholder value. So, we will continue to be disciplined as we have been in the past around the way we think about capital deployment.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Right. And by the same token, any other thoughts about just the portfolio overall? I think that probably is something you are always discussing internally, or thinking about internally. Do you think the structure, combined structure still makes sense for Eaton here?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I think in simple terms the answer is yes, we like the structure of the company today, we like the makeup of the company today, but having said that, as we've shared with this group in the past, we are always evaluating and assessing. We have laid out a very specific criteria for what's required to be a part of Eaton and the type of characteristics that businesses need to have and the type of results that they need to deliver, and to the extent that we have businesses that are not measuring up to those requirements, there are specific actions in place to improve.
And obviously they are on the clock, and they have to improve within a certain period of time. And if they don't improve, we'll do what we've done in the past, and we've always been willing to divest parts of the portfolio that don't live up to the company's expectation. And I can assure you that we have a very thorough process with our board where we review all of our businesses, including nonperforming businesses on a regular basis, and so I would tell you that we will continue to be smart and diligent in assuring that the things that are part of the company pass the criteria or have a path to it, or we'll take other action.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Right. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning, Nigel.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah, no one told me about the 10 o'clock, I actually dialed in quite early. So just want to dig in a little deeper on the projects pause, I think you called out, specifically within ESS, and I'm just wondering what are you hearing from customers here? Is this more inflation and having to back to the drawing board to reassess project returns? Is it just uncertainty around the macro? Any color there would be helpful. And any end market color in terms of where the project delays are coming from?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, what I see, Nigel, we did see it, as I mentioned, largely in large projects in the month of September, in the Americas primarily, and it was – certainly caught us by a little bit – by surprise as well, but I do think it's just simply the environment that we're in right now which is filled with lots of uncertainty, whether it's geopolitical issues, or it's the elections or it's tariffs, quite surprisingly, we were clocking along just fine and were surprised in the month of September, but we do think that it's a temporary pause, and if you take a look at the macro data, whether it's the C30 data or you take a look at some of the key end markets that we serve, there's nothing that would suggest that the fundamentals are not still very much intact. And so we'll have to see what Q4 brings, but at this point, there's nothing that would suggest that the underlying strength that we anticipated to see in our Electrical Systems & Services business would abate at this point.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then just on China, obviously there's a lot of push and pull going on in China with – obviously, we're seeing a slowdown in the data, the stimulus measures coming through. Feels like the construction markets are pretty healthy over there. Obviously you play quite strongly into the construction markets, but any comment in terms of what you're seeing in China would be helpful.

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I think, without a doubt we definitely saw a slowdown in China during the course of Q3. Principally, we saw that slowdown in vehicle markets which I think have been largely widely reported and we saw that slowdown as well, although we did deliver solid growth ourself in China in Q3 based upon a number of new wins.
And so I do think that as we think about the project business or commercial construction in China, at this point, we think that market continues to be fine. There's nothing that we're seeing in the overall economy that would suggest a significant pullback, although, clearly, there's some uncertainty in the China market as well.
I think the tariff impact and the uncertainty that that's creating, I just – I spent about a week in China myself a couple weeks ago, had an opportunity to meet with a lot of our customers and CEOs of local Chinese companies, and they, too, are feeling this period of uncertainty and I do think there's a little bit of a pause taking place in that market, as well, pending our elections and the ultimate resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Thanks, Rick.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So maybe just following up on that question on just the large project pause in North America, I guess I'm just trying to understand, did you guys have a sense that these projects were going to be awarded in September and then the customers decided to pause on the decision? Or was this more of like just a gap in the market from the strength that you'd been seeing in the most previous quarters?
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Joe, I'll take that one. It really was the former. We had expected contracts to be signed by the end of September and due to the uncertainties that Craig talked about, there are various customers that delayed committing to projects. We think it's temporary. These are projects that are quite far along, so it's not likely that they won't go forward, but it seemed to be that phenomenon, really, just in the last two weeks of September.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
And I'd say that that position is really buttressed a little bit by the fact that if you take a look at our backlog in both our Electrical Systems & Services business, as well as in our Electrical Products business, the both of them were up quite strongly in the quarter, up 12% in Electrical Systems & Services and up 16% in Electrical Products. And so I think that that thesis is really borne out by the increase in our backlog.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And perhaps my follow-on question, Craig, you mentioned earlier just initial thoughts into 2019 on the contribution margin of 25% to 30%, so that includes the tariff related impact. I'm just wondering, how much are you anticipating to get back of the $110 million in tariffs? And then, also, if you think about just like cadence from a pricing perspective, like how are you guys thinking about that as you progress through 2019?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I'd say that – once again, appreciate the question. The 25% to 30% does include the impact of tariffs and while we fully expect to recover all $110 million of the tariff related cost increases, what's obviously problematic is trying to get an incremental on top of a tariff.
And so the incrementals that we're talking about for 2019 are somewhat muted as a result of what we think will be an inability to get an incremental margin on a tariff related cost increase, but we certainly expect to fully recover those costs and we expect to be out in front of it and ensure that as we go through the quarter, that the tariff related cost increases are not a headwind to margins.

Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Understood. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey. So just a couple questions here, truck, big revision here. Is that being driven by the supply chain improving there, any kind of color?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I'd say, one, Jeff, absolutely. There were some supply chain constraints that we experienced early in the year and there was some concern that we and others had about the industry's ability to actually deliver against the underlying demand that was in the marketplace. And certainly, those constraints have been largely eliminated during the course of the year. And so that's certainly part of what drove us to revise our forecast up, as well as the market has just continued to be very robust. And I'd say the really good news even about some of the order intake that we continue to see in the North America Class 8 market, is that in all likelihood, all of these orders are not going to be delivered during the course of 2018 and they'll spill off into 2019. And so we think 2019 will be another growth year for North America Class 8 on top of a very strong year in 2018.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then data center, I think you cited as been strong, certainly it's been red hot in 2018. If you just look at backlog and quoting activity, what does that suggest for that data center market into 2019?
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, right now we enter, we will enter 2019 with a pretty decent backlog and certainly there are continued discussions for some large orders next year. So we would expect 2019 would be another robust year. Right now it's a little bit hard to say will it be as robust as 2018, 2018 after all did step up dramatically, but it should be another strong year.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning, Nicole.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. So just I don't want to harp too much on this ESS order issue but just had one more point to clarify. I guess when you think about the customer conversations that you're having and the fact that they're kind of pushing out signing contracts, is there any visibility at all on how long they're pushing out? Like is this oh, we'll delay until 4Q because we want to get this into our CapEx year? Or are these contracts more likely to be signed in 2019 once we get past this next stage of tariffs?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I think it's really difficult to say precisely, Nicole, how much of a delay we're talking about, but with these projects in general you can't delay them for that long, right? I mean, as they're tied to other underlying requirements for facilities and buildings. And so we don't anticipate that this is going to be a long delay and we would hope to see in the course of this year in the fourth quarter and certainly by time we get to Q1, that this thing rights itself.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Craig. And then second question just around Hydraulics margins, you guys had to take down guidance again. I guess what's going on there? Maybe a little bit more color and is this just a structurally less profitable business than you thought? Or is this just really attributed to price cost and other issues that are more transitory? And I guess, does Hydraulics have a place in Eaton's portfolio given what we've seen with the margin performance year-to-date?

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Sure. First of all, I'd say we too are disappointed in the fact that we've got to take margins down again in Hydraulics, but I'd say the underlying margin issue in Hydraulics is largely a function of supply chain and operational inefficiencies that we're experiencing throughout the system. They're not structural, they're absolutely fixable but we have continued to struggle with the ability to work through supply chain, we're spending a lot more than we anticipated in premium freight and expedite and overtime as the industry has ramped up and our ability, and quite frankly our suppliers' ability to deal with this ramp in orders and sales.
And so I'd say structurally speaking, nothing has changed, but having said that, as I've said with all of our businesses, Hydraulics is on the clock. And there are certain things that we have to do to demonstrate that the Hydraulics business can be a consistent performer in the company in terms of underlying margins and underlying growth rate and reduced cyclicality. And so all of the criteria that we've laid out for every part of the company also applies to Hydraulics and they have some work to do to demonstrate that we can create the kind of business that we want to own long term inside of Eaton.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
But structurally speaking, no concerns. And they're operational issues that we have to work out with our supply base. But the business remains largely on target.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks, Craig.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with UBS.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Hey, thanks, and good morning.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Just on the 2019 overall market growth of 3% to 4% that you're calling out, are you still thinking about your own outgrowth of that generally and kind of the one and a half times or two times? Or how are you guys thinking about your own performance relative to that?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I think at this point, Steve, we're still in the midst of doing our own planning internally, but you have the thesis right. The 3% to 4% is market and we would anticipate our businesses growing in excess of market. And so as we get through our own internal profit planning for 2019 and we provide guidance in January, we'll give you a sense for what we think the overall growth rate of the company will be. But it will be something on top of market growth.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on your comments on that delay that you talked about so much on the call. The order delays around ESS, are those projects that are already in the backlog that you saw the risk or just new? And if they are already in the backlog, are you – can you think about sort of this is 12 to 18-month projects; I assume these are sort of shorter term ones?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
No, I would put – these are really largely in the category of negotiations that did not result in an order, so, therefore, are not in the backlog.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So, therefore, you're not seeing or calling out any incremental risk to what's already in the backlog?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Absolutely not.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
All right. Thanks, I'll pass it on.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Yes. Good morning. I just want to go back if we can, to your 2019 tariff comments. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on which segments might be impacted more than others? And I'm also wondering if Section 301 essentially gets taken all the way, what would be the incremental impact, if you know it, or you had a to calculate it versus what you've got in the pipe today?

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Sure. I'd say – first of all, I'd say that, to answer maybe to your last question first. Most of the stuff that we do in terms of trade between China and the U.S. has already been captured in the current proposed wave of tariffs. And so if they ended up tariffing 100% of what came out of China into the U.S. it would have an immaterial impact on our company. So most of it's been captured in what's already been announced. And in the context of what's already been announced by segment, I'd say most of it will largely be in our Electrical segments. We had some earlier – some of the earlier stuff caught our industrial businesses. And this last wave, most of that will be in the Electrical sector. But we will have some smattering of impacts across the other businesses as well.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
I see. That's helpful. And again, looking at 2019 incremental margin comments, 25% to 30%, based on what you just said about tariff impact, is there a way to maybe rank the various segments in terms of where you see opportunity for incremental margins? What's above-average? What would be below average? How do you think about it?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, we certainly appreciate the question, and I'd just say this once again, it's a little bit early for us to provide that level of detailed guidance, as we've not worked through our own internal profit plans. And so perhaps in January we can provide you a bit more insight. But for right now I think if you use 25% to 30% for the overall company, it should help you at least do some preliminary modeling.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
All right. Thanks.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning, Josh.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just to maybe dig on EP here, I know you guys have talked at length in the past about an implicit attachment rate between EP and ESS. Craig, you mentioned in some of your opening remarks that the industrial side of EP was doing a little bit better. So I would assume that attachment rate is still holding, but when I think about the deceleration in the quarter, Lighting was cited as a bit of an issue. And I would imagine in 2Q that was an issue as well. So I'm just trying to figure out what inside of EP feels different sequentially, understanding that maybe Lighting isn't moving around as much.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, let me take a stab at it. I would say the fundamentals of the business, let's take Lighting out, that's a separate set of issues. The fundamentals feel not very different than in Q2. The tone of the market, the momentum. What we did see, though, right towards the end of September, is we did see a similar slowing in some of our flow goods in various parts of the business and I would attribute it to the same kind of caution that we saw in ESS, in the orders in ESS. It's just that in a flow good type business, you tend to see it in sales because it just – it's an immediate impact as opposed to simply an order being placed.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then just to go back to the outgrowth question that was asked earlier on 2019, could you maybe frame up how you think about the 6% for 2018 and what that represents of outgrowth versus markets just so we can kind of level set how that has trended?
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
I can take a stab at it. I mean, it's really hard.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Don't stab too much, it's close to Halloween, Rick.

Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, yeah.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Right.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
The way I would think about it – first of all, the way I would think about the general growth in our revenues, 2018 was a year of growth in many of our markets. It was probably above trend and what you're seeing in 2019 is you're coming back towards a more trend-like rate of growth. And our outgrowth in 2018, it's hard to know your markets, particularly in this tumultuous time very exactly, but at 6% organic growth, we're probably a point or so, maybe a little more than a point, of outgrowth.
And so if you think about 2019, you could take the 3% to 4% and add something, a point to a point and a half, maybe, roughly, outgrowth and get some kind of rough estimate of what kind of organic revenue growth we're likely to have. It'll be a little less in 2019 than in 2018, but that's to be expected, you come back to a more trend like market growth.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I think you just answered the question, Rick, that I said I wasn't going to answer.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Sorry about that.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Appreciate the color.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question is from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. I was hoping to pile on just a little bit on your thinking around 2019 and when you see overall market growth of 3% to 4%, it feels like half to three-quarters of that's probably available in terms of pricing, which would imply a fairly low growth rate on sort of a unit level. And I'm curious sort of how you think about that.
And then the follow-on would be on incremental margin. I guess I would have assumed that 25% to 30% is a good base level, but you would have had some sort of restructuring benefit on top of that. And so, recognizing you probably don't want to put numbers around that, just sort of how do we think about that qualitatively?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Inventories in the market.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yes. There is a holding number for price in our 2019 market outlook, but it's really preliminary and I wouldn't read too much into that. Does the 3% to 4% need ultimately, to be adjusted for price? Maybe, but it's just too early to have a good feel for that.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
And the incremental margin?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I'd say the way I would think about the incremental margins is that – keep in mind that a lot of the restructuring stuff that we've done, really, we got a lot of those benefits in 2018 and we'll be spending more – a similar level of restructuring expenses in 2019.
And so I think you saw the pop in incremental margins in 2018, but as you think about just the timing of programs and expense versus benefits, as you take on more and more programs, the profile of cost versus benefit changes. And so I'd say that the 25% to 30% is a good number to use right now and the restructuring programs will have good paybacks, but the – as you look at every incremental program, the length and the payback pushes out a little bit.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
I think it's fair to say we have not yet gone through the detailed restructuring initiatives for next year. So until we do that, we can't be really precise about the benefits next year from those programs.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
Fair enough. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Good morning.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Just a question on taxes. Given where taxes ended up for this year, why do we think the tax rate will go up next year, particularly as you're working to reduce it longer-term?

Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Well, there – 2018 is still a transitional year with some changes in the regulations associated with the tax bill. And so we, as we look at those changes including a step-up in the rate of the BEAT tax next year, we believe that the tax rate will naturally move a bit higher.
Now 11% to 12% we say is the overall rate, but mind you, that rate's a little lower than it would be because of the Pepsi arbitration. That was a U.S. expense, and of course a U.S. expense pulls with it the U.S. relatively higher tax rate than the rest of the world, and so that pulls the overall rate down. If you look at the rate without that Pepsi expense, the rate is going to be higher by something on the order of a point to a point and a half. And so the difference isn't as great as it seems.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got you. And then another question. How should we think – you guys sort of broke out eMobility. And how volatile should we expect this segment to be, both in terms of profitability and top line?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I'd say that we can expect a fair amount of volatility in this business. Largely, if you think about the top line, is programs and program wins will naturally be lumpy, and they come in very large chunks when you win a program. So I think from a standpoint of the revenue growth – and once again, the revenue growth we're still saying is going to be out a couple years or so. But it will naturally be lumpy, just by virtue of the type of business and the growth phase that we're in, in this particular industry. And we will continue to invest heavily in R&D. I mean, we talked about the underlying profitability being, order of magnitude 12% as we continue to invest heavily in R&D. As we win programs, each of those will require a level of R&D investment, and so I think you can expect a fair amount of lumpiness in the segment as we move forward.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Morning, Deane.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Craig, was hoping you could expand on your comments regarding that you thought most of your businesses were still in the early to mid-stage of the cycle. So what are you basing that on? Are there some bellwether verticals that give you good indications of that as to the size of projects? But some color there for starters, would be helpful.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I mean, and once again, everybody has their own kind of sense of forecasting, but one of the things we certainly look at in our largest segment, we look at the census data and we looked at consensus forecasts. And when you take a look at consensus forecasts, whether it's Dodge or IHS or Moody's or Associated Builders and Contractors, and we have an economic forecast. And there's also a number of economic forecasters and prognosticators who basically have a view of what 2019 is going to look like. And I'd say, their consensus numbers would suggest that 2019 will look not terribly different from 2018. A little bit of moderation in growth on average or looking at the median, but you're still talking about growth in the 3% to 4% range when you look at this consensus body of forecasters.
And when you – if you talk to customers, you look at negotiations, you take a look at where we are in the economic cycle versus our historical cycles. You put all these factors together. We take a look at an aerospace business that continue to do extremely well on commercial with a big backlog. You look at increased defense spending. You look at the type of orders that we're experiencing today in our North America Class 8 truck business and the type of – kind of backlog that they'll carry into 2019. So we think it's really only the vehicle markets around the world that have shown clear evidence of sales retrenchment. And most of the other markets that we serve, whether we're looking at the current view or the outlook for our markets would suggest that we continue to see growth.

And even for us, if you think about some of the headwinds that we've experienced this year in the context of even Lighting, we don't expect those headwinds to necessarily be there next year. And so once again, we think it's the forecast that we laid out, that our markets will grow 3% to 4% next year, is supported by all the economic data that we take a look at and supported by what we're hearing and seeing from customers as well.

I appreciate all that color. And then just follow-up on the free cash flow question, was there any sort of prebuying done? We talked about this last quarter, but pre-buying ahead of the tariffs, and maybe also for what you all may have done in terms of inventory building. But anything unique or an impact on the quarter that we would see?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I would say for sure we did, as I think we talked about a little bit last quarter, we did some pre-buying in terms of inventory to get out in front of the tariffs and protect our customers, and so we did build a little bit of inventory during the course of Q3 that we'd expect to unwind in Q4, and as we go forward. But nothing that I would say is material. Our cash flow numbers in the quarter, $1 billion dollars of free cash flow, and we are maintaining our guidance for the year, and so everything that we've done, we expect to largely unwind it during the course of the year.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yes, one way to think about it, Deane, is that if you look at simple way of thinking about amounts of working capital. So receivables inventory less payables divided by annualized sales were at about 21.5%, and most of the time we've operated more like 19%. So there is an opportunity to bring that down, it's largely in the inventory area because of some of the need to take positions to deal with the tariff issues. We have not yet done that, but certainly we have plans to take down this inventory back to more normal levels. We hope to make some of that progress in Q4 and some will probably extend into the first quarter of next year.

That's real helpful. Thank you.

The next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning, everybody.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Wanted to dig into the pause you discussed in some the Electrical markets and look into another vertical, Hydraulics. Did you see any similar pause in that business, specifically in energy and mining?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I'd say in Hydraulics, no, we really did not see any particular pause in energy and mining and one of the great proxies for what's going on for example in mining, you see the Cat data that's out there, which was, once again, very strong in Q3, and so material prices, the commodity prices are up, that's generally a very good thing for mining overall, very good for the equipment manufacturers. So no, we really did not see any pause in that market at all. China is a big piece of construction equipment and in China in Q3 we continue to see very strong numbers in excavator sales and wheel loaders, and so no, we have not seen a pause in those markets.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you, Craig. And then separately, Eaton's historically had a really good feel for the NAFTA Class 8 truck market. And we're seeing customers having to wait a real long time for truck deliveries. Are you guys seeing any sign of double ordering within that backlog?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
No, I think at this point we'd say no, we've seen no evidence of that. The market is good right now and obviously rates are up, capacity is up, and we are actually in a replacement cycle based upon trucks that were basically sold, and it peaks eight, nine years ago. And so right now, I'd tell you it all feels good, Andy, and that market as you know, it's subject to be volatile, but everything that we're hearing today from customers and seeing in the market would suggest that no double ordering, and 2019 will be another growth year on top of an extraordinary year in 2018.

Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you very much.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
The next question comes from and Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered by now. But maybe you could expand on the project win you talked about in eMobility, where is it, what is it, what's the timeline, just some color on that would be great?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, it was largely, I'd say, Ann, if it was a win in the commercial vehicle segment, and it was a relatively modest win in that particular business. And so I'd say today, not one that's big enough for us to make a lot of noise over at this point, we are still bidding on a number of very interesting opportunities in eMobility, but I'd say that one was largely in commercial vehicles with some of our existing customers, and really not one that I'd say that's worthy of a lot of discussion at this point.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then as a follow up, I think when I was with you earlier in the quarter and European construction was showing some signs of weakness, and yet on page 14 it's listed as mid-growth stage. I would think that that's one end market that may be at the later growth stage just given how long that market has expanded. Could you just discuss that a little bit?
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
We actually, a quarter or two ago would have said it was not yet into even mid, it was sort of late early stage and we think it's moved into the mid stage. But barring political issues in Europe, we think you'll have another year or two of reasonable growth in European construction, Ann. So that's our thinking as to why it's in the mid stage.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And any regional color, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Germany versus other regions? I'm just trying to get a sense of where you're seeing the growth. Thank you.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
I have to say, Ann, that I can't give you that off the top of my head but certainly Don can follow up with you on that.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, okay. No problem. And then the only other segment that I think I would disagree with is ag equipment, but we can talk about that offline also given the Chinese tariffs. I'll leave it there for now. Thank you.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Okay. Thanks, Ann.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
We're probably going to have time for one last question as we want to wrap up on the hour. So we've got John Walsh with Credit Suisse.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse
Hi, thank you for fitting me in here.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Great.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse
So just going back to the initial thoughts on 2019 and as we think about pension and where rates are and I think there's a little bit of a refi benefit potentially in 2019, is there something in corporate to call out? Or is it just it's early days and flat's just the appropriate way to think about it today?
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
I'd say first of all, it is early, and we think it will broadly be flat. But secondly, you do have short interest rates rising and we, like other most large corporates have roughly half of our debt swapped into floating. And so as the short rates rise, our interest costs go up. And so it's really those two factors. As a general matter, it'll be pretty flat, but secondarily, we do know at least of one factor that's likely to increase expenses slightly.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse
Okay. And then I guess thinking about data center and what the growth looks like from here is there any discernible mix benefit or headwind to call out as we kind of see the shift to colo and edge over hyper and what that impact is to Eaton?

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I'd say not. I'd say that we have a very strong position as a company in hyperscale, and that is the fast-growing segment of the market. And so I think if anything, the advantage goes to Eaton as you look at these larger, more complex hyperscale data centers.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse
Okay. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
With that, we'll wrap up the call for the day. I do want to remember that we will be available for follow up for the remainder of the day and in the days and weeks following this. Thank you all for joining us on the call today.
