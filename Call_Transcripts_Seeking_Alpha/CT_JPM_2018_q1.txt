Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Inc. First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ellen West
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. 
As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Ellen. We delivered ongoing strong revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. The sustained outstanding performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way. Robust growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Ongoing substantial growth in other revenues, namely cloud, hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of our non-ads opportunities. 
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. As we highlighted in our earnings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I review the quarter. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. 
Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $31.1 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after the impact of our hedging program. 
Turning to Alphabet's revenue by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 21%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.8 billion, up 33% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Other America revenues were $1.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year and up 35% in constant currency. 

On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.2 billion, up 39% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were, first, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A; second, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and finally, hardware related costs. 
Operating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with the biggest increase in R&D expenses reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects advertising investments in cloud and hardware as well as the Assistant. 
G&A expense trends were affected this quarter by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues and the benefit of the Uber litigation settlement. 
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.5 billion. The quarter-on-quarter step-up reflects the full year equity refresh grant to employees at the beginning of the quarter and the biannual grant to SVPs. 
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 85,050, up 4,940 people from last quarter, including just over 2,000 people who joined at the end of January when we closed our previously announced deal with HTC. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were the additions from HTC followed by hiring and cloud for both technical and sales roles. 
Operating income was $7 billion, up 7% versus last year, and the operating margin was 22%. Other income and expense was $3.5 billion, which includes $3 billion of primarily unrealized gains in equity security investments recognized under the new accounting standard. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 11% for the first quarter. As outlined in our earnings press release, this includes a 5 percentage point reduction from the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which offset the income tax expense on the equity security gains. 
Net income was $9.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $13.33. As indicated in the table in our earnings press release, these results reflect an increase in net income of $2.4 billion and $3.40 in earnings per diluted share due to the impact from the gains in equity security investments we've already discussed. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $11.6 billion with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $103 billion. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $31 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, led again by mobile search complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. 
Network revenues were $4.6 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 36% year-over-year fueled by cloud, hardware and Play. As a reminder, the hardware revenues in this line now include our Nest business, and prior periods were restated. 

We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. As we previously announced, we made a change this quarter to impression-based monetization metrics for our network business given the ongoing growth of programmatic. 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenues and up 36% year-over-year. This year-on-year increase in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic, which carries higher TAC. 
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.4 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.7 billion, reflecting investments in facilities, production equipment and data center construction. Facilities was the largest component of CapEx of this quarter due primarily to the $2.4 billion purchase of Chelsea Market that we announced in March. 
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $150 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. As a reminder, Nest results are now reported as part of the Google segment, with revenues reflected in the Google other revenues line. Operating loss was $571 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $55 million. 
We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. At Waymo, we have achieved 5 million miles of driving on city streets, adding the latest million in just 3 months. We also announced a long-term partnership with Jaguar Land Rover for their fully electric I-PACE vehicles. Verily is seeing good progress with Onduo, its joint venture with Sanofi. The companies made its diabetes management platform commercially available in 3 states with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas and South Carolina and Anthem's health plan in Georgia. 
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. The opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth. We have both the business confidence to invest appropriately in the next phase of innovation as well as clarity about some very compelling opportunities that, in our judgment, will enable us to create shareholder value. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our revenue growth again this quarter, reflecting strong underlying trends across our business, which are amplified by our relentless focus on innovation, not only in our newer businesses, like cloud and hardware, but in our sites business. Specifically, we're excited by the still sizable opportunity in search advertising led by mobile. At 26% year-on-year revenue growth in our sites business, we continue to benefit from our investments to enhance the user and advertiser experience. 
Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenues, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we continue to anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues, will slow beginning in this second quarter. 

Within OpEx, as I said last quarter, we are continuing to support our priority investment areas. Within R&D, this is reflected in increased headcount, particularly for technical roles. Sales and marketing is similarly elevated to support these areas, both in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect expenses to remain more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season. 
As you've seen in prior quarters, G&A can be a more difficult line to forecast. In particular, this quarter, we had the impact of the accrual for performance fees related to the equity gains previously discussed, partially offset by the reallocation of some expenses to other cost of revenues and the Uber legal settlement. We appreciate the importance of prioritization and are keenly focused on the steps we can take to make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. 
For our Other Bets, we remain focused on moving toward commercial applications in a number of areas with a continued focus on calibrating investment to metrics for success. 
Third, with respect to CapEx. Our commitment to growth is evident in the trend in CapEx investment, almost equally split this quarter between compute capacity and facilities. Our facilities spent in Google dominated by the Chelsea Market acquisition reflects that we favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities. With respect to compute capacity, the largest component of CapEx is for machines that incorporate the latest technologies. We are also investing in data center growth and increased network capacity through undersea cables. These combined investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook across Google, including machine learning, the Assistant and cloud. 
In many respects, these investments underscore my opening comment about both our confidence and clarity about future opportunities with our focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, high-performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers. 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Ruth. The end of Q1 is always an exciting time as we prepare for our annual developer conference, Google I/O. Computing is evolving at a rapid rate, and we can't wait to share what's next and how we are tackling important issues. I want to call out an important highlight from Q1, the Google news initiative that we unveiled in March. Over the years, we have worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges through projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages. We are building on that partnership with the $300 million investment to elevate and strengthen quality journalism. As part of this effort, we announced more than a dozen new products, including Subscribe with Google developed in close collaboration with publishers, which lets you use your Google account to buy a subscription on participating news sites. We've had overwhelming interest. 
Since the launch, we have heard from more than 300 news publishers who are interested in Subscribe with Google. We also introduced new tools for journalists and improvements to our platforms to ensure that we are surfacing accurate quality content where it matters most. 
Today, I'll quickly talk about how machine learning is helping us advance that mission, then I'll highlight progress in our 3 big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware, and share updates on our computing and advertising platforms. 
First, machine learning and making information accessible to everyone. Our own ML-powered products like Google Photos and Google Lens gets better every day. The Google Assistant is a great example of this. In the home, we have added over 200 new device partners that work with Assistant just on the last 4 months alone. We now partner with all major manufacturers of connected devices for the home in the U.S. 

All told, the Google Assistant can now help you with over 1 million actions, including new things like reminding you to buy bread when you get to the store or sending money to friends or if you want to get a ride share home. For a concept we unveiled at I/O less than 2 years ago, this is great progress. 
AI is also unlocking new opportunities for everyone. Just in the last few months, we have seen some amazing applications from dairy farmers in Georgia using TensorFlow to improve the health their herds to our own Google researchers who figured out how to use ML techniques to assess a person's risk of a heart attack. The possibilities of AI in health care are truly exciting. 
At our recent TensorFlow summit, we introduced TensorFlow hub, making it easier for developers to share and reuse models so that we can work together to tackle even more problems and get to better ideas faster. Our investments in this area are helped because of our specialized Tensor Processing Units, which are specifically designed to be highly efficient for machine learning applications. 
Of course, we continue to advance Google's core mission in other ways, too. We recently launched our Google Go app in 26 African countries. This app reduces the amount of data needed to display search results by 40%, and we continue to invest in ways to give people granular and easy controls over their information across all our products. Every single day, nearly 20 million people visit My Account, which gives them options to review their Google security, privacy and ad settings. Additionally, tools like security checkup and privacy checkup prompt people to keep their account secure and control their data settings. 
Now turning to our three big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware. Last quarter, we shared some exciting metrics about the progress of Google Cloud, including that we passed $1 billion per quarter in 2017. In Q1, we saw increasing momentum. We are growing across the board and are also signing significantly larger, more strategic deals for cloud. Our security capabilities, the easy-to-use advanced data analytics and machine learning solutions and the secure and industry-leading collaboration platform, G Suite, are winning customers over. Google Cloud is growing well. Some examples of new technologies announced in the quarter include Cloud AutoML, which makes it easier for companies without machine learning expertise to build complex neural nets and more than 20 new security products. 
Our global infrastructure continues to expand to support demand. We commissioned 3 new subsea cables and announced new regions in Canada, Japan, Netherlands and Saudi Arabia, bringing our total of recently launched and upcoming regions to 20. 
G Suite has reached a point where it can serve all the needs of a large enterprise, and as a result, grow at a certain inflection point. The Suite is growing from strength to strength. We believe our secure environment is an important factor in driving enterprise customer wins. G Suite customers like Colgate-Palmolive Company tell us that no one offers a better combination of hardware, network and data security. In Q1, we also signed agreements with customers like Airbus and Thailand's Krung Thai Bank. As a result, G Suite revenue growth accelerated in Q1. 
Next, YouTube. The platform continues to grow as millions of creators build communities and find opportunity on YouTube. Over the last year, channels earnings 6 figures annually grew more than 40%. This quarter, Dua Lipa's video for New Rules became the 100th video on YouTube to reach 1 billion views. We are also investing in new experiences like life content, where we see tremendous momentum. One recent example was our exclusive Coachella live stream, which had more than 41 million live views from all over the world. 

Coachella was YouTube's most viewed live music festival ever. And no surprise, Beyoncé was the most viewed Coachella performance ever on YouTube. Even as we invest in new experiences, we stay very focused on making sure that YouTube remains a safe platform with great content. We are aggressively combating content that violates our strict policies through a combination of user and machine flags. Over 6 million videos removed in Q4 were first flagged by our machine systems, and over 75% of those videos were removed before receiving a single view. We also changed our monetization requirements to better identify creators who contribute positively to the community and drive more ad revenue to them. 
Moving to hardware. This quarter, we welcome Nest of the Google hardware team to supercharge our efforts. Nest is building industry-leading products for the home, including new additions like the Nest Hello doorbell and Nest temperature sensor. In 2017, they sold more devices than the previous 2 years combined. They are an incredibly talented team with fantastic momentum. 
Google Home continues to be super popular, and we are making it available in many more countries. Just recently, we launched Google Home in many -- in India and Singapore, and the response has been terrific. 
Our early 2018 Net Promoter Scores rank among the highest in the industry across all product categories. This shows how much love people have for Made by Google consumer hardware devices and makes us even more excited for what's ahead. 
There's great momentum across our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome. At Mobile World Congress, a new generation of Android partner devices was introduced, including Android One phones like the Nokia 7 plus. Android One pairs high-quality hardware with a secured and streamlined software and experience from Google. This quarter, we launched the Acer Chromebook Tab 10, the first Chrome OS tablet designed specifically for education. It is a secure and easily shareable tablet equipped with all the Chromebook features that educators and students love. 
And finally, our advertising platforms. We continue to make Google Search and Shopping the best places for people to find and buy products from a range of merchants. We recently announced shopping actions, allowing customers to easily buy from their choice of participating retailers on the Google Assistant and Search with the universal card across mobile, desktop and even Google Home. The results are really helping retailers. Early testing showed that participating retailers see an average increase in basket size of about 30%. 
YouTube is delivering great results for our advertisers. To help brands reach broad audiences on YouTube with even more flexibility, we introduced TrueView for Reach, which optimizes in stream ads to reach a wide audience. In beta testing, 9 out of 10 campaigns drove a significant lift in ad recall, with an average lift of nearly 20%. 
We are also helping small businesses take advantage of video with the expansion of YouTube Director onsite to over 170 U.S. cities. This gives SMBs access to a professional filmmaker to create and edit their video ads. 
Finally, we remain focused on investing in our publisher partners. Last year, we paid $12.6 billion to publishing partners in our ad network. We recently announced AdSense Auto ads. This uses machine learning to analyze ad placements on a publisher's page and show ads when they are likely to perform well while providing a good user experience. 
Google's success depends not just on the success of our partners but also on the community's very work. We recently announced the Rolling Study Halls program for rural areas across 12 states. It equips school buses with Wi-Fi devices and onboard educators so that students with long commutes can get their homework done during the trip. 

We are also making long-term investments in our offices and data centers around the country. Last month, we announced the purchase of Manhattan's Chelsea Market building. And in Tennessee and Alabama, we broke ground on 2 new data centers, which will have a big economic impact on the local economies. These investments are made hand-in-hand with our commitment to sustainability. 
In 2017, we officially met our goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all electricity consumed by our operations around the world. 
I want to close by saying thank you to our employees. It's been a particularly tough few weeks for the Google family, especially at YouTube. I'm so proud of the resilience that our employees have shown, and I'm so grateful for the support we have gotten across the industry and from the community. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth
Ruth, just first on the accounting change, I was just hoping you could clarify. If we're trying to normalize that, is it right that we would be adding back about $632 million to operating income and then reducing EPS by $3.40, and then just on the EPS side, perhaps adjusting for the tax rate? And then just in terms of the business, I just wanted to ask about Waymo. If you could talk a little bit about just the latest timing for the commercial launch in Phoenix and how quickly you'd look to expand to other markets, and then just how you're thinking about the technology and whether you'll license it to others going forward or keep it more proprietary for Waymo services?
Ruth Porat
Sure. So on the accounting standard, we try to lay out all the component parts clearly on the cover of the earnings release so that you would have it all in one place. I think you summarized it right, but I'll just direct everybody to the earnings release. The net of which was the gain from the equity investments was $2.4 billion to net income. That is net of performance fees as well as the release of a deferred tax asset that we have, so it does reflect $3 billion in gains. And I think you know this, but this quarter, the accounting standard requires marks for everything where there is an observable raise.
So these are unrealized -- the majority of them are unrealized, not actually monetized by Alphabet, and then the performance fees are calculated based on investment returns. They're accrued but not paid until an exit event occurs, and they do appear in OpEx. And as you noted, there is also, therefore, the benefit that flows through on the tax line, and that is 5 percentage points of benefit offset to the effective tax rate for the quarter. As it relates to your Waymo question, there was a lot in there. We do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts. It is still very early. In terms of our progress, this year is about offering a service that is safe, that works, that delight users in the Phoenix area. The rider program in Phoenix is open to members of the public, and riders will use a Waymo app to hail one of our fully self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel, and will pay for the service. We've also had progress on the vehicle partnerships, as I mentioned in my opening comments. Last month, Waymo announced it signed a long-term strategic partnership with Jaguar beginning with a collaboration to design and manufacture self-driving I-PACE vehicles for Waymo's transportation service. These are all electric cars.
This new partnership in the vehicles adds to our strong position with FCA, and the production of the cars begins in 2020. And then we are expanding our testing to more states. We're also working on additional areas like applying the technology to logistics and deliveries and working with cities to help strengthen public transportation and for personal use vehicles. And as we've talked about on a bunch of calls, the opportunity is here for us because we started with safety, and we remain a leader in safety, and we do believe that's the foundation for success, and it builds on the -- all the testing miles that we've done. So we keep coming back to when you create vehicles that drive themselves faithfully, we think there's a lot of potential uses and business opportunities, and that's what we're focused on.

Operator
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini
I wanted to ask two quick questions. One, just one on GDPR then one on cloud. On GDPR, just wondering if you could share with us kind of any impact you're thinking about as the implementation occurs later in May, and so any thoughts you could share there would be great. And then on cloud, Sundar, you had mentioned you're seeing a lot of momentum. You said G Suite, I believe, accelerated in Q1. I was wondering if there was any color on the GCP side that you could share from a growth perspective if that business accelerated or not and kind of how were the deal sites trending for that business in particular.
Sundar Pichai
Great. Maybe I'll do the GDPR first. GDPR, I realize, is a fairly new public OPEC. But for us, it's not new. We started working on GDPR compliance over 18 months ago and have been very, very engaged on it. It's really important, and we care about getting it right. And overall, we have long had a very robust and strong privacy program at Google, too. So we are committed to meeting requirements on May 25 and also long term. We are working very closely with advertisers, publishers and our partners. And we will also update all the privacy policies and controls we provide to users worldwide. So it's a big effort. We are very committed to it. We are very focused on getting it right by our users and partners, and that's where our focus is now. On -- Heather, on cloud, I guess your question was about overall growth, and we are continuing -- the momentum has been very strong on cloud as well. We haven't talked about G Suite much, and so we highlighted it the moment I'm there, but cloud is continuing its great growth. We are seeing it across the board. Things worth I would call out is we are seeing larger deals as well. We are seeing good synergies between G Suite and cloud. Areas where we have done acquisitions like Apigee, they are beginning to work in terms of driving synergies to cloud. And the efforts we are beginning to put particular with our partners, that is beginning to bear fruit as well. So we have go-to-market programs now with SAP, Cisco and Salesforce. And I think we are beginning to see early results from that, and hopefully, that translates into more momentum going forward.
Operator
And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
Eric Sheridan
Maybe two for Sundar, if I can. One, on mobile search, continue to call that out as a point of strength in the results. What are you most excited about in terms of either the product innovation or the ability to get consumers to adopt mobile search more broadly on devices globally, which could lead to more ad budgets moving it to mobile search? And then on hardware, you've now been through 2 years of sort of Pixel devices. You've made the aqui-hire of ETC engineers. Can you give us a sense of what you've learned so far from your hardware efforts and how that might evolve product innovation or go-to-market strategies long term?
Sundar Pichai
On mobile search, for me, mobile obviously raises the bar. And if you look at the evolution of Search, we gave from -- we evolved to stay ahead of user expectations, and we evolved from just providing links to answers. I just feel at a high level the next big evolution we are doing as part of mobile search and assistant is to actually help users complete actions, to help get things done. And it's really hard to do at scale, and that's the work we are doing. And as we do that, it'll impact just -- not just the Assistant but mobile search more broadly. And obviously, that has a commercial impact as well. So we continue to be very excited about the opportunities there. On hardware, the exciting part for us is now, I think we have all the end-to-end capabilities of a world-class hardware organization, along with the quality of the software organizations we have always had. And in this area, it truly takes long-term planning. And so for example, if you think about silicon, et cetera, the longer you can do it, the more advantages you have. And so I definitely feel we are taking the steps towards being able to do this well for the long term. Part of that obviously involves scaling of our go-to-market strategies both in the U.S. and internationally so that we can drive adoption. I said earlier, our Net Promoter Scores show that we are right up there with the best-in-class devices and across all the products we have, not just our Pixel, across our Nest family and everything we do. So the opportunity is clearly there. We're going to lean into it, and it takes two to three years to really get to the scale where we want to see it and -- but we are committed to getting there.

Operator
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney
I want to follow up on Heather's question on GDPR, and the question I want to ask is, I understand that you're -- been working for a long time to make sure that you're compliant. But do you think that GDPR or other regulation that you see on the horizon is likely to impact materially the targeting capabilities about that advertisers have on Google? Is there something in the regulation that's going to make Google and its properties less attractive to advertisers? That's the action question I want to ask.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Mark. Above everything else, as we are working through GDPR, we are making sure we are focused on getting the user experience right for our users and our partners. But to clarify your question further, first of all, it's important to understand that most of our ad business is Search, where we rely on very limited information, essentially what is in the keywords to show a relevant ad or product. And so we've been preparing this for 18 months, and I think we are focused on getting the compliance right. It'll be a year's long effort, and we are helping not just us but our publishers and partners. But overall, we think we'll be able to do all that with the positive impact for users and publishers and the advertisers and so our business.
Operator
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak
I have two. The first one on desktop search. So it's nice to hear that your oldest business is still growing. Just curious, could you give 1 or 2 tangible examples or products that are still driving the desktop search growth? And Sundar, I understand you're always focused on user experience. At a high level, what do you see is the biggest areas potential further improvement in desktop search? And let me ask you the same question about YouTube. What are sort of the biggest areas of tension that you're focused on improving from a user perspective on YouTube right now?
Sundar Pichai
So on desktop search -- sorry, is your question on the user experience on desktop search, how do we see improvements? Look, I mean, the same. First of all, users are having cross-device experiences, cross-screen experiences, right? So I think your desktop search experience, mobile search, everything goes hand-in-hand. And every -- all the work we are doing to make mobile search better translates to desktop search as well. Areas where desktop search historically has been a bit behind is in terms of things like identity and payments and having all that work well to enhance the user experience. And with Chrome now, we are investing a lot in those areas as well, and I think that will contribute overall to improvements there. On YouTube, there are many, many areas we are focused on YouTube. They're always very focused on making sure they are supporting emerging formats, be it mobile live streaming or emerging formats like VR, and so that's an area of focus for us. We are also really looking at what are all-new monetization options for creators beyond advertising. So be it subscriptions, features like super chat, which we have launched, are very popular. We have beta testing sponsorships, merchandise, merchandising and concept, ticketing and et cetera, right? So these are all areas by which we are improving. And obviously, there are additional areas like Music and YouTube TV, which are seeing great momentum as well.
Operator
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.
Ross Sandler
Just two questions, please. Americas revenue accelerated nicely on a currency neutral basis. It's a geography that rarely comes up on your calls. So any color about what's driving that acceleration and the sustainability of what's going on in the Americas region? And then, Ruth, a question on sites TAC. So I know you said the pace of deleverage is going to start to improve next quarter. Is this something that we should expect to happen for a year and then kind of normalize back to pretty steady pace of deleverage? Or is this -- are we over some critical threshold, and we should see this trend of moderating deleverage continue for several years into the future?

Ruth Porat
So on your first question, other Americas. I would say, like the other regions, really pleased with the strength we have. Across the regions, it is obviously one of the smaller ones, so growing at a slightly faster clip and really pleased with the broad strength there. It starts with the sites revenue strength. But on top of that, they benefited from hardware devices launching in some additional markets over the past year. And then in terms of TAC, I would say there's not much to add to what we've already said after some -- a kind of sustained period of stronger increases. We were pleased last quarter to be able to signal that this quarter that pace of change is slowing, and just leave it at that for now.

And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore.
Anthony DiClemente
I have two, one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, on CapEx, even if we exclude the Chelsea Market one-timer, the gross in CapEx, is it really substantial even on a kind of recurring basis. Should we expect that sort of dramatic growth or step-up in the growth of rate in ongoing CapEx to continue throughout the year? Or other than the Chelsea Market one-timer, were there any -- do we have any reason to think that it was timing in terms of the timing, front-end weighted, it's the first quarter for CapEx? And then secondly on -- Sundar, just a question on YouTube and your media strategy at a higher level. In view of the success of other competitive subscription TV products out there, Internet video products, can you just talk about YouTube Red and any thoughts on ways you can accelerate growth for your YouTube subscription video products, whether that may be organic investment and content original production or even via acquisition?
Ruth Porat
So in terms of CapEx, it's about equally split between facilities and our technical infrastructure. And as you know that we have the $2.4 billion purchase in New York as well as discontinued ground-up development projects. Facilities does tend to be lumpier over time. We are continuing with the ground-up development projects. And as a reminder, we do favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities, and that has served us well over the years. But I think more to your question with respect to technical infrastructure, that reflects investments in compute power to support growth that we see across Google, and the largest component is on machines. It's also on data centers and undersea cables. And on machines, the biggest contributor is the demand that we're seeing. So in particular, it's the expanding application of the machine learning efforts across Alphabet, plus the requirements for cloud and Search and YouTube, and then secondarily, the increased cost of newer technologies, CPUs, memory, network. So I think, really, to answer your question most directly, it reflects the demand that we're seeing, so I wouldn't want to suggest a one-off in terms of the investments we're making in technical infrastructure. And then in terms of the data centers, we are investing globally. We currently have over 20 sites on 4 continents, and that's under different stages of construction, as Sundar noted. And it's across the U.S. Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Iowa. So we're really building out to support the growth that we're seeing.
Sundar Pichai
Sorry, on the second question on YouTube, for sure, the adoption and feedback across both YouTube Red and YouTube Music has been great to see. We are doing a lot more work there. You will see us continue to invest further and develop those offerings better, and as part of that, further drive adoption. So for example, YouTube Originals end up playing a big part in YouTube Red subscriptions. And so far, we have launched in a handful of markets, and we'll continue to roll it out to more markets there. And on YouTube Music, we are working on enhancing the product, and I think this definitely create opportunities there as well.

Operator
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
Daniel Salmon
Sundar, I had two for you. First, during the quarter, where there were some reports of changes in leadership that your Search and AI divisions functionally sounds like separating leadership over those 2 very large, important businesses for the company. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how that may impact broader strategy for the company? And then second, a little bit more technical one on your advertising business you launched, shopping actions during the quarter with a pay-per-sale model, pricing model. And I was just curious to hear what type of feedback you were getting from advertisers that led to a product with that pricing model in particular, any other features of shopping actions that you think are important to highlight.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Dan. Search has been leading the company in terms of how they have been adopting machine learning and AI, and it's really working well through Search and Assistant. We sense that, obviously, as an AI-first company, AI cuts across everything we do in Google. And so as an organization, it's a horizontal organization, which needs to serve all our areas and in some ways, the change reflects that. And we have very capable leaders. Jeff, who runs -- was the Founder of Google Brain and really well positioned to lead our AI efforts. And Ben has been at Google since the early days of Search, started in Google in 2000 and has been driving Search for over 18 years. And so we are very excited, and we think the changes will serve the company well. On your second thing, the question was on shopping actions?
Daniel Salmon
And in particular, the price per sale pricing model.
Sundar Pichai
So I think we announced the -- this new service in March, and the feedback has been very positive. I mentioned earlier, which is for retailers, when they are testing this, they see it drives an increase in basket size. So that means users are interacting with the product well, and that's all I have to share for now. It's still early days.
Operator
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.
Colin Sebastian
A couple for me, please. First, on the cloud business. I was wondering if you could provide any color, at least in the relative momentum you're seeing in that segment from infrastructure services compared to platform or software services. And then related to the adoption of AMP. I guess, a key question we get asked is whether that ultimately changes usage, and maybe you have some perspective on this from Android. But in the ecosystem between mobile web pages and app usage, if you're seeing any shift among users between those formats.
Sundar Pichai
On the first question of cloud, look, I mean, I think the main thing I would say is the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud based on what we hear back from customers is our advantage in data analytics and machine learning. The fact that we really support open, agile development environment. Kubernetes has literally become the standard for workloads and the fact that we are open in terms of how we approach this space. Security is becoming a big differentiator for us and something we've been leading for a while, and I think that's driving it. G Suite, as I called out earlier, is a good synergistic driver. G Suite is doing well, and clearly, a very unique offering, and it's gotten very comprehensive. And so I think overall, it comes together well. On your second question around AMP, AMP has been definitely very successful. It's really made publisher content much more friendly for users in terms of latency and the user experience, and hence, that option has been great. For sure, AMP has definitely helped the mobile web, and that's part of the big reasons we did it. Mobile web is still a big part of how users consume content, especially around news, and so us investing there clearly makes a difference. I guess, for example, when we look at, I don't know, J.Crew adopted AMP, their mobile page loading times are now over 90% faster. And now they are integrating the Google payment request API. That reduces checkout times from 2 minutes to 30 seconds or so. So things like that. We are going to constantly stay on improving the mobile web, and that plays a big part in how our ecosystem works.

Operator
And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.
Michael Nathanson
I have two, one for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, Sundar, can you give us any sense of how Google Home consumers are using Search in these devices differently than maybe the traditional ways of Search? And you're finding in those homes, is it additive to overall search activity? And then for Ruth, if you look at the last page of press release, where you've shown the new monetization metrics, you see a real increase in the cost per impression on network sites. So can you talk about maybe what's happening there? Is there a mix shift types of publishers, types of products? Or is that just market inflation?
Sundar Pichai
Look, for sure, Google Home gives rise to a lot of new and unique use cases, actions that are a big part of it. Call mom is a good example of something you say to Google Home a lot. I can -- which is different than what you would say to Search. We see this as a good complementary thing. You will see Search embrace some of the capabilities you find in Google Assistant and Google Home and vice versa. And so overall, I view this as additive in the long term, and we are definitely just getting started there.
Ruth Porat
And then on the network monetization trends. First, just to give people a bit more color. When we launched the AdSense businesses, our network revenues were largely click-based. And over time, there's been a meaningful mix change in our business given the strong growth in programmatic, which is impression-based. So as a result, the shift now covers more of the business. And then in terms of the question on impression growth versus CPM growth, as we've discussed on prior calls, the network business is actually a number of different businesses. And then within that, we have flat year-on-year growth in the number of impressions that was driven by efforts to improve user experience through a reduction of less relevant ads and AFC. And so these changes had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs. And then the trend and impressions in CPMs can clearly be volatile from quarter-to-quarter as we're optimizing for the user publisher and advertiser, but it really goes to the efforts that we make.
Operator
And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.
Brent Thill
Just as a question regarding any changes on your framework for growth versus operating margins. The last few quarters, you've seen steady top line acceleration, yet the margins were down. Can you just talk about how you think about it at a high level for this year? Any changes from the past?
Ruth Porat
Yes, it's an important question. As we've talked about on many, many calls, we have been and remain focused on supporting long-term revenue and profit growth, and we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary. And as I said in opening comments, just given our confidence and as we're looking forward, we want to make sure we're investing appropriately in the next phase of innovation, and we have clarity about some very compelling opportunities. And then our judgment, that enables us to maximize shareholder value. So we're taking the steps really to put in place the support for long-term -- longer-term growth. Part of what I'm saying, you can see in our sites revenue growth, try to make that clear in opening comments, we see this consistent, strong momentum globally, and we're really excited about the still sizable opportunity led by mobile search. And so we're continuing to invest to enhance the user and advertiser experience, and thereby, extend the growth in our ads business. You can see this also in the trend on the CapEx spend.
As I noted in our opening comments, the investments we're making there really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook, and that's supporting the opportunities that come out of machine learning and the Assistant. And then we also see extraordinary upside in the newer markets, as Sundar has talked about, most notably cloud computing and hardware. And so we're investing to support the long-term growth opportunity there. And then finally, when we look at the market opportunity in both self-driving cars and life sciences, our judgment is it makes sense to place the kinds of investments that we are. And with all of this, what also hasn't changed is we appreciate the importance of prioritization and picking our spots, and we're keenly focused on steps we can take to both make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. So at a high level, the approach hasn't changed. You're seeing the investments here.

Operator
And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Crédit Suisse.
Stephen Ju
So Sundar, I think one of the themes that you as a management team has talked about has been to, I guess, democratize advertising with AI to help SMBs who may have found advertising across Google's ad products to be perhaps overwhelming. So can you talk about the rate of uptake among the smaller advertisers and whether or not this is helping to catalyze growth in new budgets and where these guys might otherwise have not been able to advertise before? There's SMBs and then there's local also. So what will be the plan to get this technology into the hands of folks who will want to use them?
Sundar Pichai
Look, I mean, there's a big focus for us. And today, SMBs are -- play a big role in our ecosystem, and we are doing a lot of stuff to support them across the board, right, and from things like in our offerings to help SMBs get an online presence, create a website, be discovered in local, search and Google Maps. So we do a lot of detailed work to make sure SMBs are working well. We are also doing a lot of stuff on local as well, including efforts that are even around local services. So we have very specific initiatives. This is going to be -- I mean, it's actually -- to us, it's bread and butter of what we do here, and so there's a lot of effort underway, not to mention the fact that we provide G Suite for businesses as they scale up as well. So it's an end-to-end offering, and we'll -- you'll continue to see us invest more here.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Jason and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the program over to your host for todays conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.
Matt Cribbins
Good morning and welcome to todays webcast. Im joined by our Chairman and CEO, John Flannery; and our CFO, Jamie Miller. Before we start I would like to remind you that the press release, presentation and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our Investor website at www.ge.com/investor. Please note that some of the statements we are making are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
And now I will turn the call over to John Flannery.
John Flannery
Great, thanks, Matt. In my letter to shareholders I spoke of our path forward. We are taking what we learned in 2017, recommitting to the fundamentals, and dedicating 2018 to earning back your trust and delivering for you. Today is our first report card for 2018 and we see signs of progress. At a critical time Im extremely proud of the teams intense effort and execution focus during the first quarter.
Adjusted EPS up $0.16 was up 14%. Industrial had a strong quarter delivering $0.18, up 29%, with strong performances in Aviation, in Healthcare, in Renewables, in Transportation and higher cost out in Corporate. This is partly offset by lower Power, Oil & Gas and GE Capital earnings.
Free cash flow was about what we were expecting. It was a $1.7 billion use but, importantly, a $1.1 billion improvement over the first quarter of 2017. We continue to make progress on cash. The team is intensely focused and cash is front and center in every conversation. We see it in our results both in the fourth quarter of last year and in the first quarter. Power continues to be our biggest challenge. The team is making good progress on execution, but the market is challenging and, as weve said before, this will be a multiyear fix. We are confident we will exceed our 2018 goal of $2 billion plus of structural cost out. We delivered $800 million in the first quarter, which helped increase the industrial margin rate 60 basis points.
We have been working for several years to resolve our WMC-related exposures. As we publicly disclosed, in December 2015, the DOJ started a FIRREA investigation. In the first quarter, we booked a related reserve for $1.5 billion for WMC. Last November we announced our intention to divest $20 billion of assets over the next one to two years. We are making progress on these dispositions. Industrial Solutions will close in the second quarter and Value-Based Care in the early third quarter.
In addition, we are in active discussions on multiple smaller Aviation platforms, Current & Lighting, Distributed Power and Transportation. Weve got a lot to execute on but the first quarter was a good start to executing on our 2018 plan. There is no change to our framework of $1 to $1.07 earnings per share and $67 billion of free cash flow. We expect earnings pressure in Power will be offset by better Aviation and better Healthcare earnings and lower corporate costs. Renewables, Transportation and Oil & Gas should be about as expected.

And now next on orders. First quarter orders totaled $27 billion, up 10% reported but flat organically. Equipment orders were down 1% and service orders were up 1% organically. Jamie will give you orders details by business. The decline in equipment orders was driven by Power, which was down 40%. We saw strength across the rest of the portfolio, particularly in Renewables, Aviation and Transportation. Services orders were strong in Aviation, Healthcare and Transportation but were mostly offset by softness in Power and Renewables.
The majority of our markets are quite strong, our franchises are robust and we see a lot of opportunity for growth. Some market highlights are on the right. With respect to Power, we came into the year expecting the overall market for new gas orders in 2018 to be 30 to 34 gigawatts. Based on what we are seeing in the market, this is trending to less than 30 gigawatts. I will give you more details on Power in a couple of pages. We see broad strength in Aviation. Global revenue passenger kilometers grew 5.9% year-to-date with strong growth both domestically and internationally.
Air freight volumes grew 7.7%. Load factors posted record highs for February. In Healthcare we saw strength in emerging markets with HCS orders up 7%, Bioprocess orders were up 7% as well. The U.S. and Europe markets continue to see modest growth. In the first quarter we signed our first cell therapy FlexFactory order with Shanghai Cellular Biopharmaceutical Group. Although this is a small business for us today, cell therapy is an exciting area where we are investing for growth. Orders for cell therapy were up 78% in the first quarter. Our Renewables onshore business continues to see strong growth but there is price pressure across the industry.
Next I will go through revenue, margins and costs. Industrial segment revenues were $27.4 billion, up 9% reported and down 4% organic. The difference was driven mainly by the impact of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Aviation and Healthcare had a solid quarter, both up 6%. Power, Oil & Gas, Transportation and Renewables all had negative organic revenues and Jamie will take you through the businesses in more detail. Our Industrial margins were 10.2% in the quarter, up 60 basis points. Organically margins expanded 160 basis points. This is very solid performance given the lower revenues.
Aviation margins were 340 basis points up year-over-year on cost out and higher service revenue, offsetting the drag of 186 LEAP shipments in the quarter versus 77 last year. Transportation margins were up 520 basis points driven by lower costs and a higher mix of services. And reduction in our structural cost is a highlight. At the Industrial level cost out was $800 million. While comps will get tougher throughout the year, we expect to beat our $2 billion plus target for cost out. Power cost out was $350 million and we see upside to the $1 billion Power cost out target.
Now with respect to Power, I thought it would be helpful to give you some context on what we are seeing in the power market and the actions we are taking to drive execution. Our plan for the heavy-duty gas turbine market was built on 30 to 34 gigawatts of demand. We are seeing lower demand today driven by energy efficiency, renewables penetration and some delays in orders. Our equipment orders were down 24% in the fourth quarter and were down 40% in the first quarter.
Given what we are seeing, we believe the 2018 market is trending below 30 gigawatts and we think this is the type of market that we are going to be looking at in general for the next few years. So here is the plan that we are executing on. First, we continue to have leading technology, deep domain, digital solutions and broad and deep customer relationships. We continue to be viewed as a go to provider in our industry and we are fighting for every opportunity in the market.

On the cost side, in an industry that clearly has excess capacity, we are aggressively moving to right size our footprint and base cost. We took out $800 million of structural cost in 2017 and an additional $350 million in the first quarter. We are on track to exceed our $1 billion target for 2018 and headcount and sites are coming down. We are maximizing the economics of our installed base. Our installed base is a valuable asset. We have a third of the worlds power generation. We have increased our visibility to transactional outages by more than double since last October and thats up to 86%, which should allow us to capture more of this important market.
We are driving out cost and addressing the quality issues we had last year. The team has introduced a new sales force compensation program specifically aimed at driving transactional services and margins. We have a new leadership team in our supply chain and they are reinvigorating the use of lean and Six Sigma to drive better execution. The H cycle time is down 20%. Ultimately our goal is to cut this another 50% or more. The team has put in controls that are driving more disciplined production plans and better timing of cash in our long-term service contracts. These measures will lead to lower inventory and better cash flow over time. And we are also exiting non-core assets as we simplify the business.
Russell has built out the leadership team. In the fourth quarter we announced new leaders in Services and Supply Chain. In the first quarter, we added Chuck Nugent to run our Gas Power Systems business. He has deep operational background in Aviation and Healthcare. We have made a lot of progress putting the right team in place. So we are planning for the market to continue to be challenging, but we are taking the right steps to adjust to this market and drive execution.
In the final analysis, its important to step back and look at our total Power portfolio. We have the leading franchise in gas turbines, a strong position in wind, cutting-edge technology, digital expertise, grid and automation capability and a growing presence in storage with our GE Reservoir. There are short-term pressures but GE is on the field playing out the transformation in this industry.
And with that I will now turn it over to Jamie.
Jamie Miller
Thanks, John. Before I start with the consolidated results and, consistent with what we laid out in November, weve made adjustments to our reporting metrics starting this quarter. First, on EPS we now report an adjusted EPS number which has total continuing operations, excluding industrial gains, restructuring and other and non-operating pension and benefit costs. And on cash we have moved to reporting free cash flow as opposed to CFOA. Both of these changes reflect our continuing effort to simplify our financial reporting and bring our metrics more in line with industry peers.
Also as you know, last Friday we filed an 8-K with restated financials for 2016 and 2017 to reflect a number of new accounting standards, the most significant being the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606. I will go through more detail on the transition and financial impacts later in the discussion, but all financial metrics and prior period comparisons in this presentation are now on the new basis. And its important to note that this does not change anything related to our cash flows and has no impact on our 2018 earnings and free cash flow guidance.
On the consolidated results, first-quarter revenues were $28.7 billion, up 7% reported. Industrial revenues were $26.5 billion, up 9% reported with the Industrial segments also up 9% and organically down 4%. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.16, up from $0.14 in the first quarter of 2017 and I will walk you through the Industrial and Capital components of that. The Industrial businesses comprise $0.18 of EPS, up 29% versus last year, driven by strength in Aviation, Healthcare and lower Corporate costs. And GE Capital contributed negative $0.02 driven largely by interest on excess debt and costs relating to calling $2 billion of long-term debt during the quarter. The benefits from calling this long-term debt will be accretive within the year.

Next I will move to continuing EPS which was $0.04 for the quarter and includes $0.12 of costs related to restructuring and other, non-operating pension and benefit cost and US tax reform adjustments in GE Capital. Net EPS was negative, $0.14. As John mentioned, we recorded a $1.5 billion reserve charge to discontinued operations related to the WMC DOJ FIRREA investigation. As we have disclosed in our SEC filings and previously discussed, we have been under investigation since late 2015 by the Department of Justice related to activity in our mortgage subsidiary from 2006 and 2007.
In March we had settlement discussions following the DOJs assertion that WMC and GE Capital violated FIRREA. We recorded the reserve based on our discussions with the DOJ and a review of settlements by other banks. We do not expect this to change our view on GE Capital with regards to cash and liquidity. The discussions are ongoing and we will update you on this one as we know more. Free cash flow was negative $1.7 billion for the quarter, in line with our expectations and an improvement of $1.1 billion versus the prior year. And I will walk through more details on our cash performance in the next couple of pages.
Next on taxes, the reported GE tax rate was 15% and the adjusted tax rate was 25%. For the year we still expect an adjusted tax rate in the mid to high teens. On the right side are the segment results. Industrial segment op profit was up 7% reported and up 4% organically, driven by strong double-digit growth in Aviation, Healthcare and Transportation, partly offset by declines in Power and Oil & Gas. When combined with the lower corporate cost John mentioned earlier, the Industrial op profit is up 15% reported and up 12% organically. I will cover the individual segment dynamics separately.
Next I will cover cash. Our total Industrial free cash flow was negative $2 billion in the quarter. This represents total GE including 100% of Baker Hughes free cash flow. Adjusted for the $300 million of pension plan funding this quarter, our Industrial free cash flow was negative $1.7 billion, up $1.1 billion versus the prior year. On the right you can see the drivers of our cash flow. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $2 billion. Working capital usage was negative $1.4 billion for the quarter, driven by inventory buildup of $1.1 billion in Renewables and Aviation.
This was needed for equipment deliveries in the second half of the year. Contract assets were a cash usage of $400 million this quarter driven by cum catch adjustments on long-term service agreements of $200 million and revenue in excess of billings for another $200 million. And the other outflow of $900 million includes deferred taxes and timing items related to project cost disbursements. Finally, we spent $1 billion in CapEx to support our growth in business segments, primarily Aviation, Healthcare and Renewables, and that was slightly above what our run rate will be for the remainder of the year.
On the next page I will discuss the cash balance walk for the quarter focusing on the GE ex-Baker Hughes column. Cash on hand ended at $7.5 billion, down $4.3 billion versus year end. In addition to the free cash flow impact which I had already discussed, our quarterly dividend was an outflow of $1 billion.
Next we received $300 million of proceeds from the Baker Hughes GE share buyback and also reduced our debt by $100 million, which is net of $300 million of incremental debt to fund the pension plan. Additionally, during the quarter we had investing activity related to our Aviation business, including an incremental share in Arcam for $200 million. Finally the $900 million change in Other is comprised of the pension contribution and other timing items during the quarter. There is no change to our 2018 guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion of free cash flow. We expect to end the year with $15 billion in cash, which is driven by the next three quarters of free cash flow, and disposition proceeds while funding the pension and the dividend.

From a liquidity standpoint, in addition to the cash on hand, we have roughly $20 billion of operating lines and an additional $17 billion of backup credit lines. Finally, GE Capital ended the quarter with $22 billion of liquidity. Overall we are continuing to focus and make progress on our four key financial priorities, which are: strengthening our cash position and delevering; reducing our costs; driving a cash and returns focus; and finally, to simplify and drive more transparency. Before I cover the segments I will go through a walk of EPS on the items we have discussed with the quarter since we are using new metrics.
Starting with our net EPS of negative $0.14, there is a negative $0.18 of discontinued operations which is mostly made up of the WMC charge for $0.17. Now walking from the continuing operations of $0.04, first we had non-operating benefit cost of $0.06 in the quarter. Additionally, on Industrial restructuring and other items we incurred $0.05 of charges, $0.03 of that was related to GE excluding Oil & Gas and was primarily driven by the cost-reduction actions we are taking at Corporate, Power and Renewables. And we incurred an additional $0.02 related to our Oil & Gas segment which represents our portion of Baker Hughes GEs restructuring, most of which was synergy related. Finally, in GE Capital we incurred a $0.01 true-up adjustment related to the updates to the U.S. tax reform enactment impact on energy investments.
Next, as you know, we issued an 8-K last Friday regarding the adoption of several new accounting standards. I will walk you through two pages on that. The first page provides an overview of the standards and their application within our segment. The most significant change was driven by the new revenue accounting standard, which resulted in differences in the timing of revenue recognition versus previous accounting guidance. For GE the main drivers of the timing differences were long-term services agreements and Aviation engine accounting.
On LTSA, their long-term services agreements, changes were made related to the accounting for contract changes and changes in scope and term. For Aviation engines we previously recorded revenue using levelized margins for a contract. And under the new standard, engine accounting reflects the revenue and cost for each individual engine, the most significant effect of this change is on our new engine launches like LEAP. Lastly, one additional change from the new 606 standard is the required reporting of remaining performance obligations, or RPO, going forward. RPO represents backlog, excluding any contract or purchase order that can be terminated by a customer without substantial penalty regardless of the probability of cancellation. Our RPO as of the end of the first quarter was $253 billion compared to backlog of $372 billion.
We have included a reconciliation of RPO to backlog in the supplemental information provided today. There are a few differences between RPO and backlog for us mostly driven by our Aviation business. First, backlog includes engine contracts for which we have received purchase orders that are cancelable. We have included these in our backlog historically as our historical experience has shown no net cancellations as any canceled engines are typically moved by the airframer to other program customers. Second, our services backlog includes contracts that are cancelable without substantial penalty, primarily time and materials contracts.
And lastly, backlog includes engines contracted under long-term service agreements even if the engines have not yet been put into service. We believe that backlog provides important information to investors and have included the reconciliation I referenced earlier to RPO in the supplemental information.

On the next page you can see the financial impact associated with the accounting updates on the left side. I will cover just the impacts of the revenue change, but you can see the total impact in the far right column inclusive of the other accounting changes. In total, the other changes impacted EPS by $0.01. For the revenue change, we recorded a cumulative retained earnings adjustment of negative $8.1 billion, which includes the opening retained earnings impact of $4.2 billion plus earnings impacts in 2016 and 2017.
Additionally, we recorded a $1.1 billion charge to retained earnings for the resulting U.S. tax reform impact. The standard reduced 2017 revenue by $2.2 billion and Industrial segment profit by $2.5 billion. GAAP EPS was revised down $0.30 of which $0.17 related to the new standard and $0.13 related to the tax reform impact. Adjusted EPS post all of the accounting changes was $1 in 2017. As a reminder, our 2018 guidance incorporated the impact of the new revenue accounting standard.
On the right-hand side of the page you can see the 2017 impacts to the segment. I wont go through them individually, but you can see the impacts to both revenue and op profit by business with the most significant changes in Power, Renewables and Aviation. The adjustments to Power were driven by changes in scope, term and the treatment of contract changes for LTSAs. And in Aviation it was driven by both LTSAs and engine accounting and Renewables was also impacted by the timing of revenue recognition for International Onshore Wind. The new standard accelerated revenue so that it is recognized now on delivery versus before at installation and commissioning.
Now I will take you through the first quarter results by segment. As John discussed earlier, our current view of the market for Power, based on demand and expected contract closure timing, is trending below 30 gigawatts for 2018. And our first-quarter orders are consistent with that view. This quarter our Power orders were $5.6 billion, down 29% with equipment down 40% and services down 19%. In equipment, gas power systems orders were down 52%. Excluding Distributed Power reciprocating engines, GPS orders were down 71% on lower gas turbines, aero derivatives and steam units. We received no orders for H units, which was in line with our plan. Steam Power System orders were down 80% as a result of the non-repeat of two large orders in India last year.
Turning to services, our orders were down 19%, but down 12% ex-Water. Our contractual services orders were down 14% principally on lower AGPs and fewer replacement parts needed during outages as a result of the recent upgrade cycle. Utilization of the CSA fleet continues to perform as expected. Transactional orders were down 20% on lower AGPs and outages and in total we received four AGP orders versus 20 for last year.
Revenues in the quarter were $7.2 billion, down 9%. Equipment revenues were down 16% on lower gas turbines, heat recovery steam generators and aero derivative units. Service revenues of $3.7 billion were down 2% and up 8% ex-Water. Contractual Services revenue was down 18% on lower AGPs and a mix of content and outages this quarter. Transactional Services were up double-digits on higher outages and field service repairs and total AGPs in the quarter were 6 versus 21 last year.
Op profit of $273 million was down 38% principally on lower equipment volume, unfavorable price, lower AGPs and the absence of Water. This was partially offset by structural cost out of $354 million, down 17% and ahead of plan. As John discussed earlier, we are making progress on taking cost out, repositioning our services business and fixing execution issues. We are aggressively implementing additional actions; however, the pace of the market decline is greater than the near-term benefit of those actions. As a result, we expect business operating performance to be about flat to 2017, lower than we outlined at our November investor meeting.

Next on Aviation the market continues to be strong. Global revenue passenger kilometers grew by 5.9% through February year-to-date with solid growth in domestic and international markets and air freight volumes also had a strong start to 2018 growing at 7.7% through February. Industry load factors posted a record high in February at 80.4%. Orders in the quarter of $8.1 billion were up 13%. Equipment orders grew 18% on higher commercial engine orders, up 39%, driven by GEnx and LEAP.
Military engine orders were up 87% on large helicopter and F-110 contracts. Services orders grew 10% with commercial services up 5% on a higher spares rate of $25.2 million a day, up 16%. Military service orders grew 17%. Revenues in the quarter grew 7% to $7.1 billion. Equipment revenue was down 2% on fewer legacy engine shipments partially offset by higher LEAP shipments. We shipped 186 LEAP engines versus 77 a year ago. This is roughly 70 engines behind our original plan for the quarter. Military equipment revenues were up 22%. Services revenues grew 12%.
Operating profit of $1.6 billion was up 26% driven primarily by higher pricing on commercial engines and aftermarket material, as well as product cost productivity, which is partly offset by negative mix from higher LEAP shipments. Operating margins expanded 340 basis points in the quarter and 80 basis points of that was driven by the lower LEAP shipments. Aviation had a strong start to the year, outperforming in the quarter relative to expectations. This was driven principally by better spares performance, cost execution and favorable engine mix. We expect these trends to continue.
And on LEAP, as I mentioned, Aviation delivered 186 engines with improving cost position. LEAP product performance continues to be excellent. We are making good progress on our commitment to recover on LEAP deliveries by the end of third quarter and are on track to deliver 1,100 to 1,200 engines in 2018.
Moving to the top right on Renewable Energy, orders of $2.4 billion were up 15% over last year. Onshore Wind orders were $2.1 billion, up 16% on higher equipment, which was up 24%, partially offset by services down 21% on timing of U.S. repower orders. Wind turbine unit orders totaled 936 on higher U.S. volume while international orders declined 46%. Pricing on new units continues to be difficult and was down 13% in the quarter versus last year. Hydro orders of $199 million were down 26% mostly based on the timing of the orders profile.
Sales of $1.6 billion were down 7% on lower onshore unit shipments of 352 versus 539 last year. Higher services volume and hydro were up 25% and partially offset the lower shipments. Operating profit of $77 million was up 10% driven by the acquisition of LM. On an organic basis op profit was down 3% on unfavorable pricing and negative leverage on the lower onshore equipment volume. This was partially offset by better structural and product cost out. The onshore market continues to have pricing headwinds with wind turbines but we are making good progress on cost out. Product demand for Renewables remains strong with onshore megawatts and unit order growth expected to be up high single-digits to double-digits for the year and the business remains on track.
Now on to Healthcare. Orders of $4.7 billion were up 4% versus last year and up 1% organically. Geographically organic orders were down 1% in the U.S. and 2% in Europe. Emerging market organic orders were up 7%. On a product line basis Healthcare Systems orders were up 4% reported and were flat organically. Life Sciences orders grew 9% reported and 5% on an organic basis. Healthcare revenues of $4.7 billion grew 9% reported and 6% organically with Healthcare Systems up 6% and Life Sciences up 7%, both on an organic basis.

Operating profit of $735 million was up 11% driven by continued volume growth in productivity, partially offset by pricing and higher program investment. Margins expanded 70 basis points organically in the quarter. Also, as you saw, we announced the disposition of our Value-Based Care solutions division in Healthcare Digital to Veritas for over $1 billion of cash. This is part of the planned $20 billion of Industrial dispositions we discussed. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. We feel confident in the Healthcare markets going forward; relative softness in the U.S. market in the quarter was driven by timing and tough comparisons. We feel good about the ability of the Healthcare team to outperform for the year.
On the next page I will start with Oil & Gas. Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning at 6:45 and Lorenzo and his team will hold their earnings call with investors today at 9:30. Similar to prior quarters I will provide a comparison to the combined business based on financials as if the merger had taken place on 1/1 of 2016. For reference I will give you the total orders and revenue comparisons of our legacy Oil & Gas business. Orders were $5.2 billion, up 102% reported and up 2% excluding BHI. On a combined business basis orders were up 9%. This was driven by growth in all product segments with equipment up 9% and services up 8%. Market fundamentals are supportive of growth as crude oil prices have remained relatively range bound, providing stability for customers to more effectively evaluate projects.
The gas markets continue to grow and LNG demand is strong. Revenues were $5.4 billion, up 74% reported and down 8% excluding BHI. On a combined business basis revenues were up 1%. Short cycle oilfield services and digital solutions revenues were up 12% and 4% respectively while the longer cycle oilfield equipment and turbomachinery and process solutions were down 7% and 11% respectively. Operating profit was $181 million, down 30% reported and down about 77% in our legacy Oil & Gas business driven by declines in our longer cycle oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses partially offset by synergies.
During the quarter, cash distributions from Baker Hughes GE totaled $440 million including the share repurchases and the quarterly dividend of $127 million. Lorenzo and Brian will provide more details on their call today. The team is executing well with $144 million of integration synergies in the quarter, on track for $700 million for the year.
Next is Transportation. North American carload volume was up 2.4% in the quarter primarily driven by Intermodal carloads up 5.6% and commodity carloads down 0.7%. Parked locomotives showed signs of improvement but remain at historically high levels. Orders of $1.5 billion were up 46%. Equipment orders were up 34% and we received orders for 342 locomotives compared to 37 in first quarter of 2017.
Additionally, we continue to see strong growth in mining with wheel unit orders up 30%. Services orders were up 58% on strong locomotive parts and mods growth. Revenues of $872 million were down 11% with equipment revenues down 47% on lower locomotive volume. This was partially offset by higher mining revenue up 148%. Services revenues were up 26% driven by aftermarket parts growth and mod shipments. Op profit of $130 million was up 37% driven by services growth and mining wheel shipments more than offsetting the effects of locomotive volume decline.
Overall Transportation delivered a strong quarter. Although carload volumes have improved and weve seen a decrease in the number of parked locomotives, the market for new locomotives is still slow. The mining markets continue to recover with six consecutive quarters of orders growth. The Transportation team is done a great job of balancing operational execution while also making significant progress on positioning the business for disposition.

Moving over to Lighting, revenues for Current & Lighting were down 1% with Current down 7% and the legacy Lighting business up 5%. Operating profit was $1 million, down from $10 million last year. In the first quarter we announced an agreement to sell our Europe, Middle East, Africa and Turkey and global automotive lighting businesses. These businesses represented approximately $200 million of Current & Lightings annual revenue of $2 billion. We expect to close substantially all of this deal in the second quarter and to sell the remainder of Current & Lighting by the end of 2018.
Finally I will cover GE Capital. Continuing operations generated a loss of $215 million in the quarter, down $168 million from prior year. This decline includes a $45 million loss related to updates to the U.S. tax reform impact on energy investments and a $50 million charge associated with upfront costs from calling approximately $2 billion of excess debt.
This ALM action will be accretive within the year. In addition, the business recorded lower gains and tax benefits that were partially offset by lower corporate and restructuring costs. We expect to have higher income and gains in the second half of the year driven by lower excess debt costs, tax planning benefits and asset sale gains related to our strategic plan we announced last quarter. Discontinued operations generated a loss of $1.6 billion, primarily driven by the WMC DOJ FIRREA reserve, and $53 million of trailing costs related to the GE Capital exit plan.
GE Capital ended the quarter with $146 billion of assets including $22 billion of cash and short-term investments. We paid down $9 billion of debt during the quarter, which is in line with our overall capital allocation framework. As I mentioned earlier, GE Capital has sufficient liquidity to manage the WMC FIRREA settlement. We are continuing to execute on our plan to improve the capital position and remain committed to meeting target capital levels by the end of 2019. We continue to explore incremental asset sale opportunities within GE Capital and will monitor and evaluate levels of capital based on the timing of asset sales and the potential WMC settlement.
With that, I will turn it back over to John.
John Flannery
Okay, thanks, Jamie. There is no change to our 2018 outlook for Industrial EPS or free cash flow. Given pressure in Power we see EPS closer to the lower end of the range. As I said earlier, we expect earnings pressure in Power will be offset by better Aviation and Healthcare earnings and lower Corporate costs. Renewables, Transportation and Oil & Gas should be about as expected. Cost out was $800 million in the quarter, on track to be better than $2 billion. Cost out in Power in the quarter was $350 million. Corporate was down $176 million and we are executing on synergies in BHGE.
As Jamie mentioned, GE Capital earnings will be breakeven for the total year due to our portfolio actions and we expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half. We are targeting free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion. At $1 billion better than last years first quarter our first quarter is on track and no change to the outlook for the year.
I thought I would wrap with an update on the actions we are taking to run the Company better and an update on the portfolio. We are in the middle of our three-year strategic planning process and we have enhanced our approach this year. Much more detailed analysis on the markets, on our outlook, and a very detailed three-year financial plan for our businesses. We will be reporting out a summary of that to our Board in the second quarter.
We have our shareholder meeting next Wednesday and a Board meeting on Tuesday and we are very excited to have Tom Horton, Leslie Seidman and Larry Culp on board. They have been attending meetings since their announcement and are getting up to speed quickly and are fully engaged.

As I shared with you earlier, we are beginning to see some green shoots in Power on the execution front. Ive talked in the past also about our new compensation system which better aligns management with investors, less cash, more stock compensation and two metrics cash and EPS. We rolled out the new plan to the top 4,000 employees in the Company and your management team is aligned and everyone knows the definition of success.
Last year, given the urgency and severity of our challenges, we launched directly and with brute force into cost-cutting mode and improving our cash controls during the second half of the year. You can see the impact of this in the results of our past two quarters. I always had in my mind that there would be a second phase where it could be more deliberate about a new way to run the Company.
In that context I asked a group of our top leaders to spend a week at Crotonville working on developing a new GE operating system. They studied the worlds best business system models. We asked six outstanding external leaders in their industries to meet with the team to share their best practices. Im excited about the path we are on. We are taking a new approach on how we run the Company. Our business units will be the center of gravity. HQ will be substantially smaller and will focus only on strategy, governance, capital allocation and talent. We will continue to leverage our horizontal capability across the Company.
I will personally lead the development and implementation of a new GE operating system that will be based on lean, Six Sigma and agile. We will drive and measure continuous improvement, operating performance and customer experience. We are also reinstating rigorous talent management and development with a focus both on values and performance to ensure the strong differentiation and organization vitality.
We expect this GE operating system will be applied within the Tier 1 business levels as well. And we are confident this is going to yield incremental cost savings above our current forecasts while creating a simpler, leaner high-performance Company.
As I said in my opening with respect to the portfolio, we are making progress on the $20 billion of dispositions we are targeting for 2018 and 2019. Industrial Solutions is on track to close in the quarter. Cash proceeds will be $1.9 billion. We announced the sale of Value-Based Care last quarter and we expect it to close early third quarter. Cash proceeds there will be $1 billion.
The divestment process on Transportation is progressing and we expect to have more to report in the second quarter. Earlier this year we laid out a framework to shrink GE Capital assets by $15 billion over the next two years. Assets were down in the quarter by $2 billion including a small portfolio sale.
Finally, and importantly, as I shared with you in January, we continue to review and evolve our thought process regarding the best structure or structures for the Company. Our guiding principle is to ensure that our businesses have the right operating rigor, management alignment and the organic and inorganic flexibility to maximize their potential and their value for our customers, our employees and our investors.
The Board, including our three new directors, is heavily engaged in this process. We have done and are continuing to do a significant amount of work looking at the best way to achieve our objectives in pursuit of our guiding principles. Consistent with what we said earlier this year, we expect to have something more to share with you on that within the next couple of months.
And with that, Matt, I will turn it back over to you.
Matt Cribbins
Thanks, John. With that, operator, lets open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.
Julian Mitchell
Hi, good morning.
John Flannery
Good morning.
Julian Mitchell
Good morning. Maybe just a first question around the Power business. Some sense I guess as to how much below your prior plan you think this year will shake out on the profit side. And also I guess related to that, what you are thinking about the cash conversion ratio. And if I look at the numbers, obviously profits are down a lot in Q1, but at least it was a fairly normal decremental margin, unlike the second half. So does that tell us that a lot of those excess costs youd booked in the second half, you think you are through that process now with cleanup?
Jamie Miller
Good morning, Julian. This is Jamie. Hey, I will take that one and then maybe John can get some color, sort of the broader Power market and what we see operationally. So first with respect to what we see in 2018, and maybe Ill talk about this a little bit versus last year and a little bit versus the prior guide. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we see 2018 as probably flat to 2017 or flat to prior year. You see the market shifting that we see, so we saw 30 to 35 gigawatts really shifting to maybe less than 30 as we look at the year.
So honestly as you look at, whether it is versus prior guide or versus 2017, this is really mostly a market story. Our prior guide had 60 to 70 gas turbine units. Our new guide would be 50 to 55. And on the aero side we had 30 to 40 before and now 20 to 30. And really the impact is just supply chain overhead, as you dont have those units come through you just see more liquidation impact. The second piece on cash, Power cash I would tell you for the first quarter was below plan, but that is not unusual for us in that business.
First quarter is seasonally low  a strong second-half unit shipment and unit profile order  profile for things. And then from a market perspective, as we talk about the market what you really see there is progress burn not being replaced as quickly by progress coming in from new orders. So, Power for this year continues to look like a real second-half profile story both with respect to the gas power business but really also with respect to how we see the trending in services.
John Flannery
And Julian, I would just add just a few sort of macro thoughts about how we are looking at Power right now, and kind of sequentially go through the market, our market share, our cost structure, what we are doing in the service business. I think, as you have all seen, the market and our market share is lumpy by quarter. But I think we do see enough trends, looking at our pipeline over 12 to 18 months, that we think this is going to trend softer than the 30 to 34 by a bit.
And I think the factors are well known. Part of it is Renewables penetration. Part of it also is the pricing of renewables keeps moving and we see utility customers in a bit of a wait-and-see mode to see how that pricing evolves over the next year. And then with energy efficiency, on the consumer side of things we are seeing more people comfortable with maybe lower surplus reserves and being able to delay some of their CapEx decisions.
So our market share, again, moves around by quarter, but we had about a 50% share last year and that ranged all over the place, about a 40 point swing in various quarters around a mean of 50%. We expect to be in that 45%, 50% basis on a rolling four quarters going forward. Our commercial teams I would say  we continue to be very disciplined on our approach to the risk and return of what we are seeing in the market. And that really leads you to a lower revenue outlook and obviously lower cost plan.
So we have announced the 12,000 jobs out, $350 million cost out in the quarter. Well exceed the $1 billion target for 2018. And we are taking cost out at a much faster rate than the revenues are coming down but theres still an overall pressure there. And then on service, we see a lot off chance and opportunity here to improve the service business. So our contractual business is relatively stable and more stable. Where we have really been hurt in the last 12 months has been in our transactional business.

Thats about 40% of the business in services. And we have taken big leadership changes there and also put in some very specific plans around increasing our visibility and making sure we are close to customers, see outages. That is more than double right now. We have got very specific sales incentive plans around driving revenue in that space and margin in that space.
And then a lot of changes we can make on our cash conversion, to your point. So new supply chain leaders managing cycle time, managing our payment terms, billing accuracy, et cetera. So  collecting past dues, we collected about $500 million of past dues in the first two weeks of April.
So we think there is a lot of improvement we can make in the business, but its operating in a tough environment overall. And then the last thing I would say at a Company level is really looking at our energy portfolio in the aggregate. So obviously the gas turbine business has certain pressures based on whats going on in the industry. Those same factors pop up in a different way in our Renewable business, in our grid and grid software business, in the opportunity for storage. I think at a Company level we look at a holistic mix of what we have there.
Operator
Thank you. Next we have Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.
Steve Tusa
Hey guys, good morning.
John Flannery
Good morning.
Jamie Miller
Good morning.
Steve Tusa
When we think about the guidance, so you took down the Power guide, I think you said Healthcare maybe could outperform a little bit. You didnt talk about the Aviation guidance. And just the way I am looking at this is basically the LEAPs will obviously ramp very hard in the second half and the 56s probably start to come down a bit. So your standing guide is $6.2 billion I believe to $6.3 billion on segment profit there. Any update to that number?
Jamie Miller
Yes, so on Power, I talked about it being flat to 2017. When you think about the rest of 2018 for the other businesses, we see very solid outlook for Aviation and real strength there. Healthcare is also really looking very solid for 2018 and we see upside there as well. And then the other piece thats coming through in a really strong way is cost out. And you saw that in the corporate numbers, but we are really seeing that across the board across the businesses in terms of just better cost productivity. Drilling in on aviation just a little bit, I mean obviously the market feels really good. Demand outpacing capacity, and you see that both in commercial and in military.
On the operations side we had less LEAP than we expected, but I will tell you, our spares rate was very favorable in the business. And I think that mix story and the cost management story  we see that really continuing throughout the year. Just to touch on LEAP, because I am sure that will be a question at some point, we are about 70 units behind as we hit the end of the first quarter. But as we look to the year we have got a very deep line of sight.
The team is really, really focused on it into supply chain and exactly what we need to do, what our suppliers need to do to really move LEAP execution. And right now we are tracking to be back on track by the end of third quarter and be in line for that 1,100 to 1,200 unit shipment story. So really I think on the Aviation side it feels very solid.
John Flannery
Steve, I would just add on the cost side of things, Jamie gave you a good sense as to how strong the outlook is for the business segments in Aviation and Healthcare. But on the cost side of things we just continue to see a lot of opportunity there. So you are starting to see that in our numbers. Russell and the team working it very hard in the Power business; Lorenzo and the team getting the synergies that we need in BHGE. And we still see big opportunities in really the overhead structures of the Company overall. And as I mentioned in earlier remarks about the operating system and really a philosophical sort of shift to pushing the management structures into the businesses, we think there is still more opportunity on cost as we go forward here.

Operator
Next we have Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Sprague
Thank you, good morning, everyone.
Jamie Miller
Good morning.
Jeffrey Sprague
Good morning. I was wondering if I could ask a couple of questions on the balance sheet actually, just trying to sort a couple things out. The receivable from capital to the parent declined about $4 billion in the quarter. If you could give us any color on what was going on there. And also I see goodwill and intangibles went up in Industrial about $1.5 billion sequentially. Maybe coincidently, but that kind of seems to erase the $1.5 billion equity hit at capital on the reserve. Maybe just a little color on whats going on in those two pieces.
Jamie Miller
Yes, the goodwill piece of it was really FX. And so, there really werent any other changes. There were a few minor purchase price adjustments, but the goodwill shift was largely just the FX mark on the balance sheet. And in terms of the receivables from GE Capital, thats really just net maturities of debt.
Operator
Thank you. Next we have Steven Winoker from UBS.
Steven Winoker
Thanks and good morning, all. Just a couple of questions here. First, if I could, on the GE Capital kind of cash walk, cash availability given the $22 billion that you are starting with now. And maybe talk through how youre thinking about, Jamie, that in terms of asset sales offsetting debt maturities and insurance contributions, kind of what you have left.
And then secondly, John, I assume its no accident that you are talking about the GE operating system here and youve got Larry joining your Board soon. And theres a lot on that external best practice front to sort of think about in terms of opportunity. Have you sized that opportunity at all and paced it? And is that also what should give us confidence around hitting the EPS walk this year? And sorry about all the questions but I know I might get cut off after this. Thanks.
Jamie Miller
Hey, good morning. So I will take the GE Capital question here on just how we see liquidity and the asset sales there. So, GE Capital ended the quarter with $22 billion of cash and short-term investments. And we expect to maintain about $15 billion to $20 billion of liquidity through 2018 and 2019 in GE Capital. The asset sales that we talked about in January are well underway. We are seeing a really strong interest in the assets and we have got engagement with multiple parties right now.
In March we sold the first tranche of our tax equity portfolio and I think it was a really good template to use for future asset sales. But we see those coming in nicely throughout the balance of 2018 and our outlook right now is that our liquidity profile at Capital should nicely match kind of how we see the needs there in terms of debt maturities and the other flows. John, do you want to talk about the other?
John Flannery
Yes, let me pick up on that. And Steve, I would just say a few things for context. This idea in general is really something that Ive been experiencing and thinking about frankly for years. If you look back in the last three roles that I really had in the Company going back to  going to India in 2009. I had a sense in that role of frankly how difficult it could be to try to get things done far away from the center of the Company, if you will, and how much concentration there was of decision-making in the center of the Company.
Then went to the BD role and had a sense of how we are allocating capital around the Company and between the units. And then in the Healthcare business another perspective of running a business unit. So those three things really formed a thought in my mind that we needed to decentralize the basic management of the Company and push the responsibility out to the regions, out to the businesses. So I would say thats just sort of background on the evolution of the thinking, if you will.

And then the Crotonville exercise was quite interesting. We had half a dozen people come in, many of whom were ex-GE executives that had gone on to other companies. And we went through what are the things you kept, what made sense, what was helpful. So, that was added to the thinking that we already brought to the table and there clearly are companies that have done this well including Danaher.
So, I wouldnt size this number right now, but I would just say we think it could be meaningful on the cost front at the GE corporate level. We think it could be meaningful in the businesses as well. And then I think the main benefit of this overall over time though is better accountability and really pushing the onus of execution and that sense of ownership down into the business units.
Operator
Next we have Scott Davis from Melius Research.
Scott Davis
Hi, good morning, guys.
John Flannery
Good morning, Scott.
Jamie Miller
Good morning.
Scott Davis
Im trying to get a sense of just in the Power business explicitly, and really two small questions here. But one is what is the cost of quality going to  what did it hit you this quarter, what do you think it will hit you this year? And is the $2 billion still the right number? I mean, that $2 billion cost out was based on probably a higher market forecast, certainly a higher market forecast and maybe even a higher longer-term market forecast maybe as you guys have dug in a little bit deeper here. I will stop with that.
Jamie Miller
Yes, Scott, on the operational side, we are really making progress on that. We still have work to do there, but what I would tell you is that the numbers of issues we are seeing and the size of the issues we are seeing continues to go down. When you look at the real comparison to last year, or even the comparison to our previous guide, some of that is market like I talked about and some of that is a reduction in some of the operational issues we are seeing. But remember, we have got a really strong base cost out profile here.
And the actions John talked about are really being layered in beginning in the second half of last year and really throughout this year. And we see that is really pulling through and offsetting some of that incremental noise that we expect. The other piece  and I mentioned this earlier but I will just say it again  that I think is important to think about is that Scott Strazik came in to really run the Power Services business. There have been a number of actions Scott and the team have taken both around how they are organized, how they are running the business between the contractual piece and the transactional piece.
And then how they are putting in different changes around pricing, around sales incentive programs and other things that, honestly, that ramps as you go through the year too. And services and Power will tend to be I think a second half peak.

Scott, I would add one of the thing. Jamie hit the nail on the head on the costs; we just continue to work that item and Russell and the team are working that very hard. I would just underscore the team is battling extremely hard. I am watching this day in, day out. This is the top priority of our team here. And Id just say the Power team in a tough environment is digging in hard and really giving it every effort. We have made a lot of changes to the team, so not only in terms of the most senior leadership there but down a level  Jamie mentioned Scott.
We have a new services CFO, Chuck Nugent, who as I mentioned came over to the Gas Power Systems CEO. The commercial leader has changed, supply chain leader has changed. So in many ways watching this, it reminds me of the first year I had in Healthcare where just  you changed the team, the team coalesces around the focus on cost and improving the business. And it takes time, obviously it took us time to get into this dynamic and it will take us some time to work out it. But Id, again, applaud the teams efforts on this.

Next we have Andrew Obin from Bank of America.
Andrew Obin
Yes, good morning.
Jamie Miller
Good morning.
Andrew Obin
A couple of questions. So, transactional progression, because it seems profit wise thats a big swing for Power profitability. I guess you indicated it was up double-digits. Can you just sort of talk about what initiatives you are doing inside the transactional business in Power to drive this growth? And what can it be by year-end, how much visibility you have? And second just more geographic color inside
John Flannery
We dont give a very detailed focus of that business by numbers, but let me tell you a higher level. As we said, theres really two key factors here. One is visibility into outages in the non-contracted installed base. And then second obviously is the ability to penetrate, capture and get the right margins in that business.
We had an issue with visibility into the installed base. So when Scott got into that business last fall we were seeing that we had visibility around 40%. So we just were missing a significant amount of the opportunities there. And they have gone through an exhaustive method to catalog the installed base and make sure we have got good visibility there. That is trending up close to 90%.
So step one obviously is to know better what is going on in the market. And then the rest is shoe leather and sales coverage and making sure the teams have good value propositions, understand what to say in front of the customers, the right incentives. And we have, as I said earlier, specific sales incentives around this area of business and particularly the margin rate in this area of the business. So this is a blocking and tackling exercise on visibility and sales execution and we think it will yield results  good results.

Next we have Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.
Andrew Kaplowitz
Hey, good morning, guys.
John Flannery
Good morning.
Andrew Kaplowitz
John, can you talk about your line of sight into the $5 billion to $10 billion in Industrial asset sales that you mentioned, and whether you think you will get the valuations that you want on these deals? And then stepping back from there, obviously there has been quite a bit of talk about bigger changes at GE, whether its a bigger breakup or spins. Maybe can you give us any color as to what you are thinking at this point on the structure of the Company?
Jamie Miller
Yes, so Andy, maybe I will take the first piece of that and then throw it over to John for the portfolio piece. So on the dispositions  and John mentioned a number of these things early in the call, but Industrial Solutions, we see that closing in second quarter, $1.9 billion of cash. You probably saw the announcement a couple of weeks ago on Value-Based Care. Thats another $1 billion probably third-quarter close if not second quarter. And then as we really start to move down the list with Distributed Power, a couple of Aviation platforms and Transportation we are seeing strong interest across the board.
Multiples will vary by the deals just because the industries are in different cycles, but we see line of sight to these planes landing as we start to get into the second half. The other piece, and I know people have asked this before, so maybe I will just throw it out, is we look at free cash flow going into 2019. If you assume all these close at the end of 2018, these represent about $1.2 billion of free cash flow ex-Industrial Solutions. Thats another data point on that one.
John Flannery
And then, Andrew, just go back to maybe the principles that we went through before. So first and foremost, strong franchises concentrating, as we said, in Power, Aviation and Healthcare. Step one is to make sure we are running those businesses the best way we can and get the best results out of those businesses. I think we are seeing progress on that result, so that we step into any thinking about the portfolio really on our front foot with the businesses performing well, I think that is where we are. But ultimately we have to think through and I have to think through what is the environment and conditions that will help these businesses flourish not just in 2018 but five years ahead, 10 years ahead, 20 years ahead.

And in that regard basically we disclosed earlier and discussed earlier looking at all options. Ultimately its a question of whats the right structure for resources, for organic and inorganic strategic flexibility, for the right level of management execution, for the right level of cost structure and things in the Company overall that we reference. And getting the right outcome for customers, for the employees and for the investors. So, there is no sacred cows. We are reviewing a number of structures. We are working through this right now in great detail with the Board, including our new Board members, we are being deeply thoughtful about this, purposeful about this.
And we will give you an update in the next couple of months, as we said earlier. So, theres a lot of work and engagement. The last thing I would say just, importantly, there are factors to consider. We see them as solvable and manageable, but I want to reiterate we are making no changes to the 2018 capital allocation framework, no change to our financial policies. We will honor all the commitments we have with employees and retirees and bondholders as we consider any options that we would look at.

Our final question today comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel.
Robert McCarthy
Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me?
John Flannery
Yes.
Robert McCarthy
All right, I will keep it quick. In terms of the enumerated assets subject to divestiture, the $20 billion, can you give us an update of what you think the cash conversion, the Industrial free cash flow conversion on those businesses are? And the spirit of the question is what are we playing for here? Because you have got trendline CFOA of probably $11 billion to $13 billion. And from that standpoint with $3 billion of CapEx, what can we be playing for for Industrial free cash flow per share in a bull case in 2019?
Jamie Miller
So first, we dont give out 2019 guidance at this point. But I would say a couple of things. So, I mentioned before that these businesses that are in the disposition path represent about $1.2 billion of free cash flow for 2019, assuming they all sort of left at the end of the year and thats ex-Industrial Solutions. As you get into 2019 there is a couple of other things to remember, most importantly that weve got a very heavy load of restructuring cash out this year that really drops as we go into 2019. And so, that offsets a lot, if not more, of the free cash flow exits that we have going. And then as we get into 2019  as we get into later in the year we will lay out the earnings profile for the businesses. So hopefully that helps at least a little bit at the high-level.
John Flannery
One thing I would just add to that just to clarify, the $1.2 billion is the free cash flow of that grouping of assets. $5 billion to $10 billion is the cash  range of cash proceeds we see; the actual enterprise value and how those deals are structured would be quite higher than that. So you should not take one and divide by the other for multiple of them. Interest level on these assets is good and the multiples are attractive.
Matt Cribbins
All right, great. Wed like to thank everyone for joining today. Just as a reminder, the replay of todays call will be available this afternoon on our Investor website. Next Wednesday we will be holding our annual shareholders meeting in Imperial, Pennsylvania; and, John, you will be at EPG on Wednesday, May 23.
John Flannery
Thats right. Matt, Id just like to finish and just say, again, thanks to the GE team. It was a great performance in the quarter by the team, great effort, great focus. And one of the joys of my job is being able to watch you perform around the world. I had a chance to do that in the first quarter. But a reminder to the team and also to everyone else, its a step forward in the 2018 plan, but we need to continue to execute, keep the focus there. And the only thing that matters at the end of the day really is delivering the full-year results for 2018 and thats what we will be focused on. So thanks and we will see you at EPG. All right, thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Eaton First Quarter Earnings Call. For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
I'll turn the call now over to Mr. Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for today for Eaton's first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today as usual are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.
Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the company's performance in the first quarter along with our outlook for 2018. As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.
The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation are posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of the call will be accessible on our website and will be available for replay.
Before I get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today will include some statements on expected future results of the company and as therefore are forward looking statements. The actual results may differ from those from our forecasted protections to a whole wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in both the earnings release and the presentation and they're also outlined in our 8-K.
With that I'll turn it over to Craig to go through the presentation.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Okay. Thanks, Don. Appreciate it. Hey, before I dive into Q1 results this morning, I thought I'd take a moment to just reiterate three key elements of the strategy that we've been working on as a company and how we're focusing on growing the company, expanding margins and really effectively allocating capital.
First, our organic growth initiative really is focused on new technology, how we're leveraging our channel and service capabilities, creating products that play across the entire spectrum of our customers' requirements, what we call delivering superior value.
Next we intend to continue to expand our margins by restructuring to eliminate fixed costs, to drive operational improvements across our plants and functions, and we're being more selective in where we invest; what we call fixing the tail and growing the head.
Finally, we continue to be good stewards of capital, first by investing in our existing businesses, playing to win in every business that we're in, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and being disciplined in our approach to M&A.
By consistently doing these three things well, we believe we'll drive superior value for our shareholders both in the short term and over the long term. And we made solid progress in Q1. A few examples that we've noted on page four. We launched our new eMobility segment targeted at growth in electric vehicles. A $2 billion to $4 billion opportunity for Eaton and we're clearly working this opportunity with 30 plus pursuits that we're working on as we speak. And we'll certainly talk about this more later in the presentation.

We continue to make progress towards our goal of digitally enabling our product portfolio including addressing the necessary infrastructure needed to ensure industry approvals and needed security protocols. We launched a new Microgrid initiative in Africa, combining our expertise in Microgrid management with energy storage.
And we also had a very successful quarter growing our penetration in hyperscale data centers with over $60 million of new wins in the quarter. We launched a new Power Xpert circuit breaker product line for the harsh, hazardous and corrosive circuit protection market, a market that we believe is $500 million in size and a new opportunity for us to serve it. And lastly, we continue to execute on our ongoing restructuring actions and completed three site closures in the quarter. So while not an exhaustive list, we thought it would be helpful to provide a few notable examples of progress that we're making towards our strategy.
Now turning to our financial results for Q1 on page five, I'll just add a bit of color to what you've already seen in our reported results. Earnings per share were $1.10, up 15% over Q1 2017 and at the high end of our guidance range of $1 to $1.10.
Our results were primarily driven by strong revenues, up 8% over Q1. This is driven by 6% organic growth, the highest growth that we reported since Q4 of 2011. And foreign exchange added 3% or approximately $150 million to reported revenues. We had expected $150 million of forex for the entire year, so certainly a strong start there as well.
Booking strength continued in the quarter with notable growth in Hydraulics and another quarter of strength in Electrical Systems & Services. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was $339 million. And if you recall, Q1 is typically our weakest quarter of cash flow generation. In addition, we're adding working capital to support higher growth in the quarter and a stronger outlook for the year.
We repurchased $300 million of our shares in the quarter and are on track to repurchase $800 million in shares for the full year. And finally, we increased our dividend by 10%. This is consistent with our long term goal of growing our dividend in line with our long term earnings.
Turning to page six, we show a summary of the income statement for the quarter. Here I point out that our 8% growth was made up of 6% organic, 3% FX, offset by negative 1% due to the divestiture in Electrical Systems & Services and the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture last year.
Margins were 15.2%, 80 basis points above prior year and a Q1 record. We think a good indication that our restructuring plans are paying off. Consistent with our plans, our incremental margins on organic growth were approximately 30% in the quarter and we remain confident in our ability to achieve 40% incrementals for the full year. We did see good volume leverage in the quarter, generating 12% net income growth on 2% organic growth and we expect this relationship to improve as the year unfolds.
Moving into the segments, I will begin with Electrical Products. Our revenues were up 5% with 1% organic growth. Sales in this segment were impacted by our Lighting business which was down approximately 10% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Lighting, organic growth in the segment was 6%, so strong growth excluding Lighting.
Maybe just a word on Lighting weakness. The weakness was driven primarily by what you've seen, reported weak markets. There were also a number of large projects in last year's results and management's decision, quite frankly, not to chase some unattractive projects during the quarter. We do expect Lighting to have a relatively better next three quarters. And consistent with our prior guidance, we think the business will be down mid-single-digit for the year.

For the remainder of the business, we saw strength in a number of end markets with particular strength in products going into industrial applications. And geographically, we saw strength in Europe and in North America. Bookings were down 2% in the quarter, also driven by Lighting weakness. Excluding Lighting, bookings were up 2% with strength in Power Distribution Components and Industrial Controls.
Notably, our margins in the quarter were up 30 basis points over the first quarter, a first quarter record as well. The results for Electrical Systems & Services are on page eight. Revenues were up 4% in the quarter with organic up 2.3%. We rounded it to 2% on the chart. Foreign exchange was up 2.2%. We also rounded it to 2% on the chart. And the divestiture of our stake in a small joint venture reduced revenues by approximately 1%.
In the quarter, we saw market strength in services in harsh and hazardous and power distribution assemblies for industrial markets. And geographically, the U.S. markets saw the greatest strength.
Bookings in the quarter were up 8% on strength in industrial projects and in services. And as we noted in Q4, our backlog for industrial projects continued to expand and as a result, we would expect to see organic growth accelerate beginning in the second quarter. I'd also note that our operating margins improved by 50 basis points in this segment.
Next, taking a look at the Hydraulics business, sales were very strong, up 21% with organic revenues up 16% and foreign exchange adding 5%. In the quarter, all regions were up significantly with particular strength in construction equipment and through the distribution channel.
Bookings were up 14% in the quarter with strength coming primarily from OEM customers and really all end markets. And we also saw booking strength across all geographies. Given our very large backlog, we expect this market will remain strong throughout 2018.
Margins were 12.7% in the quarter, up 250 basis points over Q1 2017 and we continue to see the benefits of our restructuring efforts as well as the benefits of higher revenues. Now we continue to experience some challenges as we continue to ramp this business in the face of very strong demand levels, but we do expect to see improvements beginning in Q2. And we're certainly on track to deliver our full year margin guidance in this segment.
For Aerospace, we had another strong quarter. We saw 7% sales growth with 6% organic. Sales growth was driven primarily by strength in military which was up 13%. And the military strength extended across really all categories including the military aftermarket.
Always lumpy orders in the quarter were up 1% on aftermarket and strength in rotorcraft offset by weakness in both military and commercial transport. And margins were 19.4%, up 90 basis points over last year and once again, a Q1 record.
We also had a very strong quarter in the Vehicle business. Sales up 14%, of which organic revenues were up 13%. Foreign exchange added 3% and the divestiture impact from the joint venture formation with Cummins was a negative 2%.
NAFTA heavy duty truck production was up 45% in the quarter and also Brazil truck and bus was up nearly 6%. So lots of strength in our truck business around the world. In addition, order strength continued through the quarter. We now expect NAFTA heavy duty production will be 295,000 units in 2018, significantly higher than the outlook of 275,000 that we had at the start of the year.
U.S. and China light vehicle markets are expected to be flat for the year. Europe a bit better. And strong growth in the emerging markets, specifically in India and Brazil.
Margins were 14.8% in the quarter, up 110 basis points on better than expected revenue and benefits from prior restructuring efforts. Margins, while good, were held back somewhat by higher restructuring costs in this quarter and we certainly expect them to improve in the out quarters.

Page 12 is a first look at the financial results of our eMobility segment. You'll find 2016 results for eMobility, including the restatement of our Electrical Products and Vehicle segments in our 10-Q which will be out later today.
Sales in the quarter were $77 million, up 22% from prior year, 19% coming from organic growth. The organic growth in the quarter was driven by new European electric vehicle penetration and growth in electrical products going in traditional internal combustion engine applications in North America.
Margins in the quarter were 14.3%. This is down from prior year due to additional R&D investment and spending on specific customer programs. This is an exciting new segment for Eaton and we expect to see double-digit growth in this segment for some time to come.
So before we move into the remainder of the year, I do want to provide some additional background on our new eMobility segment for those who may not have had an opportunity to join us at our investment conference in New York.
eMobility is really a great example of how we're capturing synergies across the company, in this case, to pursue emerging market opportunities in electric vehicles. So what are we doing? In simple terms we're combining the unique industry knowledge, customer relationships and, I'd say, application knowledge from our Vehicle business with the proven technology that we've created in our Electrical business. All of the technologies and products that are needed to support electric vehicles were already selling in homes and factories and offices in our Electrical business.
More development and customer specific changes are certainly needed, but this is exactly what our Vehicle business does very well. And electrification is a good thing for Eaton. Our addressable content per vehicle is actually 8 to 10 times greater on an electric vehicle than it is on an internal combustion engine.
So just turning to page 14, electrification of vehicles will no doubt be a very large market and we've decided to really focus on those areas where we can create the right to win and have unique technology. On page 14, we show you the specifics of where we intend to focus and that's in power electronics and conversion and on power distribution and circuit protection.
You can see from the description that these technologies are critical to the safe and reliable operation of the vehicle. But what you really can't see is what we already do. And that's  we have a very large business in both of these technologies across our electrical markets.
We're a market leader in power conversion from our UPS business and in power distribution and circuit protection from both our Bussmann fuses as well as our legacy circuit breaker business. We're already selling many of the electrical products into both electric vehicles and into internal combustion engine markets, and look forward to exploring the opportunity to expanding this opportunity as the electric vehicle market continues to grow.
On page 15, we included an outlook for 2018. And here we expect revenues to be approximately $320 million, 12% organic growth. And we think the segment will deliver 12% and 13% full year margins. Our margins were down versus 2017 as a result of a significant step up in R&D spending and where we expect to spend approximately $30 million in this segment for the year.
More importantly, I'd say we expect a serve a market that will grow to over $33 billion over the next 10 years or so, and we think Eaton can capture $2 billion to $4 billion of additional revenue by that same timeframe. So we're working with a number of global OEMs as we speak and are certainly excited about the opportunity to make eMobility a meaningful part of the company.
At this point I'll turn to our outlook which is on page 15. Excuse me, page 16. We now expect organic revenues to grow 5% for the year up 1% from prior estimates driven by, as you can see here, an increase in both Hydraulics and Vehicle.

We expect Hydraulics to be up an additional 3% and now forecast a 13% increase for the year and Vehicle to be up an additional 3% and we now expect a 4% increase for the year. The other segments are unchanged from our prior guidance.
And for margins on page 17, we're increasing our segment margin guidance for Eaton from 16.4% to 17% or 16.7% at the midpoint, up from our prior guidance of 16.6% at the midpoint. We're also raising the margin expectations for our Vehicle segment to 16.5% to 17.1% for the year.
And as we noted last year, we'd only intend to change margin guidance for our segments when they're outside of the prior guidance or ranges provided, hence the increase in Vehicle. And our other segments remain unchanged as our expectations for the year continue to be within the prior ranges.
On page 18, we provide a summary of Q2 and our 2018 guidance. For Q2 we expect EPS of $1.25 to $1.35. This assumes 5% organic growth, margins of 16.2% to 16. 8%, and a tax rate of 11.5% and 12.5%. For the full year we now expect EPS of $5.10 to $5.30, up $0.10 at the midpoint from our prior guidance; organic revenues of 5%, up 1%. We think foreign exchange will be a positive $250 million now, $100 million above our prior guidance.
We think segment margins are now expected to be, as I noted, 16.4% to 17%. Corporate expenses will be slightly higher than what we originally forecasted, $10 million above 2017. The prior guidance was flat. And we expect our tax rate to be down modestly with a range of 12.5% to 14.5%, down from our prior guidance of 13% to 15%. Cash flow, CapEx, share repurchase and restructuring cost assumptions are really unchanged from the prior guidance.
And so just before I turn things back to Don for Q&A, I did want to once again take this opportunity to summarize why we think Eaton is a very attractive investment opportunity. The first I'd say, our markets have returned to growth and we think the next three years will be better than the last three.
In addition, we have a number of attractive organic growth initiatives that we think will allow us to grow faster than our end markets. Our restructuring is paying off. Our margins will be at an all time high in 2018, and we expect our margins to continue to improve.
Our balance sheet is in great shape. Net debt to capital is below 30%. Our pension plan is now funded at over 95%. Our cash flow continues to be strong and we expect to consistently deliver cash flow at or above 100% of net income, while generating $8 billion of free cash flow over the next three years.
And we're also returning cash to shareholders through a high dividend yield. Our dividend today is north of 3.5% and we're buying back shares, 1% to 2% on an ongoing basis. And lastly, we'll deliver 11% to 12% EPS growth over the next three years. So we think it's a fairly compelling story and, once again, a very good reason to take another look at how you view the stock.
So with those opening comments, I'll pause and turn it back to Don for Q&A
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Operator's going to provide you instructions for the Q&A. But before I do, I would like to remind you that we have a large number of questions on the call today, and I'd ask you that you  to try to keep it at an hour today, I'd ask you sort of keep your questions  limit your questions to a single question and a follow-up.
And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to give you instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our first question today comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, guys.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Morning.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Craig, can we maybe just start on Lighting for a second? It's been a bit of a drag on growth in orders for the last several quarters and I'm just curious, like, how are you guys thinking about this business internally just from a strategic perspective? And how important is it to the overall portfolio?

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. I appreciate the question. First of all, I'd say that the Lighting results in Q1 were certainly were below our expectations as a company, but very much in line with our outlook for the year. As we said back in New York, we thought this would be the one segment inside the company that would be under pressure during the course of the year. And so we still believe, down low single digit is very much in line with our thinking when we set our plan at the beginning of the year.
And to your point around strategically how we view Lighting, I'd say Lighting, very much like the rest of the company, has to live up to our company's expectations around the criteria that we set for what an attractive business looks like.
And we talked about it being  businesses have to be leaders in their markets. They have to grow in excess of GDP. They have to deliver attractive return on sale and attractive return on net asset. And where we're in cyclical businesses, they have to deliver a minimum level of profitability. And so I would say, the Lighting business inside of Eaton today is a business that has a lot of positive things and a lot positives going on, but it's also a business, I would say, today that still has something to prove.
And so with respect to Lighting, we have work to do to turn this into the type of business that meets all of Eaton's criteria for businesses that we want to be in. So we continue to invest, we continue to like many of the prospects, but we clearly have something to prove in this business.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
That's helpful color, Craig. And maybe for my second question, if I could just focus on ESS growth in orders. Clearly, the order momentum is there. It sounds like large project activity is picking up. No change to the organic growth guidance, but you're expecting an acceleration in 2Q.
So maybe just provide a little bit of commentary around your thoughts on growth for the remainder of the year, the acceleration that's expected. And whether this is one where potentially we could get outside the range, just given how strong the order momentum has been.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. I mean, at this point, I think, I would say, it's early in the year and, but perhaps too early to make a change to the guidance. But we are, in fact, seeing very strong growth in our Electrical Systems & Services business, driven as we said at the beginning of the year, by power distribution, large assemblies, harsh and hazardous markets, the Crouse-Hinds business, and certainly, today we're really seeing perhaps even more strength than we originally anticipated in our three-phase power quality business.
And so our negotiations are up solidly for Q1 as well. And so we certainly are hopeful that this business continues to grow at the rate that we expect and we'll have to take another look at it in Q2. But at this point, we think the guidance that we provided is prudent and we're optimistic that this business continues to grow not only in 2018, but we think the outlook for the next few years for our Electrical Systems & Services business is quite positive.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Good to hear. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with UBS.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Can you maybe just give a little more color on the incremental walk that you're talking about for the rest of the year? I know obviously restructuring and you got the benefits from that, maybe pricing actions versus material and wage inflation and productivity. Just little more color for how that's progressing given the 1Q performance.

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yes, and I'd say that if we think about our incremental performance in Q1, they were in fact largely in line with what our own expectations were as we've built our profit plan . And so we were quite pleased overall with how we did in Q1.
And as you think about why things will improve in subsequent quarters, I'd say there's really two pieces. You hit on one. It's restructuring, net spending versus benefits and those are certainly will increase in each of the subsequent quarters.
And the other thing I would say is that our net price versus commodity inflation performance will actually improve as well as the year unfolds. And so those are really the two, I'd say things that will give us ultimately a lift in our margins. And we had some volume growth in some of our businesses as well. But those are really the two big ones that will generate incremental margins and incremental return on sales as the year unfolds.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
I would think that volume leverage would be very significant too given this large step up you're looking at for the rest of the year.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, absolutely. We also see a benefit there.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
And just following up on your pricing point, so what  in terms of actions that you've taken versus those that are kind of being phased in through the rest of the year, would you say that you're about a quarter of the way through those pricing actions? Have you taken more of them? Just some perspective on that.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Sure. Yeah, maybe the first thing, just to go back to what we said in New York. We talked about what  we anticipated that Section 232 would have an impact of roughly $50 million. Well that impact has been significantly reduced with all of the exceptions that have been made in terms of countries that are no longer in scope or potentially no longer in scope, and we'll see how it finally unfolds. But that number went from 50 million down to about 10 million.
Secondly, I'd say that inside of our businesses, we have already either taken or announced price increases in each of our businesses that essentially offset or more than offset the commodity inflation that we anticipate and can see at this point.
As we take a look at commodities in general, they're certainly running at higher levels than we planned originally. But our teams have gotten out in front. We've already, as I mentioned, taken price increases or announced price increases. And we're fairly confident that we don't expect commodity price inflation to be a drag on margins at all for us this year.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
All right. Thanks, Craig. I'll hand it on.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Morning.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Most of the operational questions have been addressed so I'd like to focus maybe on your comments on eMobility. Craig, I think you said that the content opportunity for Eaton is 8 to 10 times versus an internal combustion engine. Was that reference just to gasoline engines or was that also diesel engines? Because if I recall, you probably have more content on a diesel engine than you do on a spark-ignition engine.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. First maybe just to clarify that point. And no, we don't have more content on diesel than we do a gasoline engine. We have content on both platforms and we're not necessarily biased to one or the other. And perhaps one of the pieces that you reference is the whole diesel issue in Europe and how that would impact the company. And for us, it won't have an impact at all. Those become gasoline engines, we're just as well positioned as if they would be a diesel engine.

Ann, but to your other point, yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you think about the content available to Eaton as the world moves to more electric vehicles and commercial vehicles and off-road equipment, our opportunity as a company, it really does increase by 8 to 10 times. And that's simply the electrical content on those vehicles versus the content today that we would sell in the form of valves and valve actuation and superchargers and other product that you would typically find on an internal combustion engine. So for us it's an exciting opportunity and we think a real growth opportunity and the reason why we launched this eMobility initiative and are putting so much resource behind it.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And this may be an unfair question for a conference call and quarter conference call, but are there any lessons learned from the penetration of LED lighting that can be used in eMobility? I mean I look at the world and I see companies like (29:44) have already also created an eMobility segment. Are there any lessons learned from conversion of industries where you can take the learnings from one division to another?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I think there absolutely is, Ann. And I think if there's one message and if you had our Lighting team on a call they would probably say play to win and make the early investments and bet on the technology winning. And that's exactly way we're approaching the eMobility opportunity. That's one of the reasons why the margins are down in 2018 in eMobility is because we were investing heavily in that segment. So we clearly intend to play to win and to play to win globally and our teams are excited by the opportunity.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. I'll leave it there and get back in line. I appreciate it.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Thanks
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.
Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Morning.
Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC
Hi. Just following up a little bit with Ann on eMobility. I mean, I don't know what scale looks like in eMobility. It's still early days, but do you feel like you have enough? I mean, I look at the product portfolio and you're really strong in circuit protection and power conversion but there's a lot of electricals on the car. I mean, does it change your M&A strategy or the things that you'd like to have or think about bolting on that you've sent your M&A guys out to explore?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. The first thing I'd say is as we think about kind of the places where we've decided to play around power conversion, power distribution, I'd say we're really leveraging the strength of what we do today. We have a very large Electrical business today where we provide exactly the same types of technology in buildings. And so I think one of the real advantages that Eaton has versus other companies who are approaching this opportunity, we have the ability to leverage existing technology and leverage the scale that we already get through participating in these technologies in our Electrical business.
Having said that, there is obviously customer specific modifications that will be required. And in many cases we'll have to make some additional investments and we're certainly view this as a segment that we'd be willing to look at M&A opportunities and partnerships in. But I think we're in a great starting position because we do have this very strong base of technology and knowhow and customer intimacy through our Vehicle business.
Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC
Makes sense. And just to again go back to  a couple folks have asked about Lighting and I'll ask about it too. I mean, when Eaton bought Cooper, I mean, most of us I think felt that Eaton might sell their Lighting business. It was something that was easy to parse off and it's an industry that's desperately in need of some level of consolidation it appears. But do you need to be in the lighting business? And at what point do you just say, we're fighting too many wars here? I mean, you're trying to build an eMobility business at the same time you're  gosh, you've got lots of SKUs here. And do you need to be in lighting? And how much time are you going to give it?

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, no, what I'd say is, first of all, I think we have an attractive Lighting business. We are arguably the second largest lighting LED supplier in the North America market and have really enviable positions with a full product range. And so I'd say today, if you think about as lighting businesses go, we have one of the most attractive lighting businesses we think in the world. And so it's an attractive business in the context of the markets in which we compete.
Yeah, and in some cases we are, in fact, leveraging some common distributors. But I'd say do we have to be in lighting? Does it have a negative impact on the balance of our Electrical businesses if we're not in it? I'd say no. But one of the things we've said in general as we think about the company, every one of the businesses that are part of Eaton has to stand on its own. It has to be a good business in its own right to earn the right to continue to be part of the company.
And so no different than the criteria that we've set for Hydraulics or Vehicle or any part of the company, we have to prove that this is a good business in its own right. And if there's other synergistic things that it brings to the table as a part of Electrical, that's fine, but the first thing we have to do is demonstrate that this is going to be a good business as a standalone business inside of the company. And so we think we're working on all the right things to make improvements. But as we said with any part of the company, if we get to the point where we don't believe it can live up to our expectations, we'll be prepared to make other decisions.
Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC
Good answer. Thanks guys, and good luck to you.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Thanks.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Hey, sorry to come back to Lighting again, but just a few other things to clarify if I could. I think, Craig, in your opening remarks you said you thought it would be down mid-single-digit for the year. But I think in response to a question you said low. So could you clarify that as point one?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. I mean I'd say that, kind of parsing numbers at this point, but I'd say low-single-digit is currently the viewpoint on the business in terms of where we think it'll end.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
And then I was actually more curious just actually on the size of Lighting. For it to be a 5-point impact on organic growth and down 10% implies the business is a fair amount bigger than I thought it was, like in the neighborhood of $3 billion plus or so. Is there some other adjustment you're making when you talk about how much it's down, maybe excluding the projects from last year? Or what other color could you give us on that?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. I'm not sure about kind of the way you did the math, but it's not even  not close to $3 billion in revenue. So, I mean, we can maybe offline, help you with your model, but it's...
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Jeff let me just add, it's in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Yeah. That's what I thought. Okay. Thank you very much.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Okay. Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe going back to eMobility. Craig, help us maybe better understand the opportunity here. You're investing a lot in R&D. In order for you to win in this market, are we talking about you displacing already existing players? How would that process work over time? And how should people think about incremental margins here as we're thinking about beyond 2018 for this segment?

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. Yeah, appreciate the question. And I'd say that for us what's most exciting about this opportunity is that, no, we don't have to displace existing companies in this space as electrification is largely a new market today without a number of established competitors. And so really it's a wide open space today and the ultimate kind of winners in this space are yet to be determined.
So we think, if you think about what Eaton brings to the table, we have as much of a right to win in this space as anyone, given what we do in our Electrical business. And so we do believe that it's going to be a great opportunity.
Yes, to your point, lots of companies are pursuing eMobility and electrification. I think the two areas in which we've chosen to focus are places where we are uniquely situated and have unique capabilities. And we think, if you think about the business long term, yes, some relatively large upfront investments. But we think, long term, we think the margins in this segment also become very much attractive and in line with the rest of the company.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then my follow-up, maybe kind of a small modeling clarification. Is there a way to quantify the price cost drag that you had in the first quarter? And I want to make sure that I'm clear on this. You're basically saying that you're going to be neutral in, going forward or in the back half of the year on that, right?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. And we're not going to  we won't specify specifically Q1, but I will say that as you think about the back  beginning in Q2 and the back half of the year, the price cost equation for us is better than it was in Q1. So despite the fact that we reported record margins in Q1, for Q1, we did have a little bit of drag and it gets better as the year unfolds.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
And you're going to be neutral by year end 2018? Are you going to catch up with that? Or...
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. We will basically be neutral. Commodity costs will not be an issue for us at all this year.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay. Appreciate it.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Maybe just trying to understand within Electrical Products, I think the margin guide for the year is for that to be up maybe close to 100 points or so at the mid-point. Q1 is starting out some way below that.
I understand maybe there's some volume leverage as Lighting comes back. But I guess in the past when Lighting revenues grew a lot, it was called out as a mix headwind to margins. So I guess I'm trying to understand what gets the EP margin momentum improving over the next three quarters? And whether Lighting sales recovering is a contributor or a headwind to that process.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I'd say the way to really think about it is there's a fair amount of cyclicality in this business in general. And so our Electrical businesses typically have higher volumes in the second half of the year. And so Q1 has always been historically a, relatively speaking, tough to call north of 17% margins low. But for that business, it's always been kind of the weakest quarter. So there's the seasonality as a function of volume that impacts Q1 and positively impacts the subsequent quarters.
And then as I mentioned as the price cost equation improves as the year unfolds and we start to see even greater restructuring benefits in our business as the year unfolds. Those would be the three elements that I'd say that would result in the better margins as the year unwinds in the Electrical Products segment.

Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.
So Lighting should be sort of a neutral impact on...
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. Lighting is  the changes in revenue are not going to have a material impact at all on the margins.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Very clear. Thank you. And then my follow-up would just be on capital deployment. You have the guidance of $800 million share buyback spending I think retained for this year as a whole. You spent $300 million in Q1. Should we think that if the share price stays around where it is, that $800 million guidance starts to look pretty conservative? Are you trying to be sort of deliberately opportunistic here on the amount spent on buybacks?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
You know, I think very much consistent with what we said is that we will generate a lot of cash this year and we don't intend to let cash build up on the balance sheet. Our first priority is clearly investing in our businesses which we're doing. We have committed to a very strong dividend and $800 million of share buyback. But in the event that our stock price kind of continues to languish at the levels that it's at right now, we find our stock to be very attractive as an opportunity to accelerate buybacks or to buy back more. So that continues to be an option that we're considering. And we're obviously considering that in the context of obviously other opportunities around M&A. But at the current pricing levels, we find our stock to be very attractive.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. I'm going to avoid the penalty for piling on, on another Lighting question. So I just wanted to get some clarity on one of the businesses that you highlighted at the beginning in terms of accomplishments in the first quarter, the increased penetration in hyperscale data center market which has  that whole market has changed so much in the past couple of years. That market's expectations and use of UPS is drastically different from what mainstream data centers use. So how is it that you've been able to address this market? Is in particularly is it new products? Is it service? And what's the opportunity from here?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, no, I think to your point, it's actually a very attractive market and if you think about today when  the data center markets today, most of what we sell into the data center markets actually is in our core electrical distribution business. And yes, we have a very big footprint as well in power quality, but it's a very positive story for our electrical distribution business as well. And I'd say so much of what's going on today, it's not so much new products as much as it is most of our major customers building out their infrastructure to try to keep up with this massive generation and consumption of data that we all tend to generate.
And so I would put it as more in terms of the market fundamentals, the secular trends that we all live with every day that's requiring that our customers build out more infrastructure.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And then just a follow-up question for Rick. Can you give any color regarding the tax rate being tweaked lower on the year? Is this any further clarification on tax reform or is it something very company specific?
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
It's really company-specific. We've now had a chance to digest all of the complexities of the tax bill. And we've made some adjustments to our own structure and plans that allowed us to pull the rate down a little bit.

Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Oppenheimer. I'm sorry, Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. I apologize.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
Good morning. I thought I hadn't changed.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Sorry, I didn't mean to preclude an announcement there. Sorry, Steve.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Who know, maybe you will be prescient. But anyway, I will risk the piling on penalty. Just one more quick one on Lighting. Craig, are there pieces of Lighting that are doing well? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you had to restructure the business just to control what you can control because the market is what it is, are there things you could do that would improve that business?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, and I'd say we're always working to restructure businesses to focus on  one of the things we talked about across the company is that in every business it's a normal distribution of  there's always things that are going very well or with attractive margins. There's always pieces of every business, even an attractive business, where there's opportunities to improve them. What we call grow the head, fix the tail.
And so that initiative really cuts across the company and Lighting is no different. And we're certainly looking at opportunities to just be more focused in our Lighting business on those places where we have a unique technology and the right to win and looking at the other marginal activities where they tend to be more commoditized. And so I'd say that is absolutely a piece of the formula in Lighting. It's really a piece of the formula in the way we run all of our businesses.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
Okay fair enough. And then maybe on ESS. Traditionally when that business starts to grow backlog, there's an opportunity to improve pricing and sort of the margin that's in the backlog. As you look into the backlog, is that happening? Should we be expecting better margin in the backlog?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, what I'd say without commenting specifically on margin in the backlog, I think your general thesis is correct. In this environment where our Electrical Systems & Services business is growing, we are in fact building backlog. Orders are growing. It makes the opportunity to get price that much easier.
And so I do think we are all fortuitous at this point in the cycle where we are in fact experiencing some commodity inflation. But at the same time, markets are very strong. And in many of our facilities, we are pushing lead times out because many of our factories are sold out. And so it's a very positive environment climate in general to get price.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you so much.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Chris Glynn, who actually is with Oppenheimer. Chris, by the way I'll be seeing my optometrist a little later in the day to get this problem fixed.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks. You can buy our in-house optom. So just on Hydraulics, I think about 24% reported incrementals depending on how FX plays here. Maybe low relative to the full year Eaton targets around 40%. I know you've been fighting some market ramp inefficiencies there, but wondering what you think Hydraulics incremental should be showing here in terms of internal views absent ramp inefficiencies.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
No, I think the number you quoted is a very good number. We think 40% incremental is the right incremental level to think about for our Hydraulics business. And to your point, we certainly have been experiencing some ramp inefficiencies as orders continue to run and outstrip our supply chain's ability to respond. And so we're expediting and running a lot more overtime and not as efficiently as we would ordinarily run as we try to catch this ramp in the cycle. But I think 40% is absolutely the right number. And as I mentioned, we think that business, once again as we look forward, we think it starts to deliver much more consistently with those kinds of expectations.

Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay great. And then I'll take a penalty for the team there and go back to Lighting. Just wondering on the volume declines what the relative impact roughly is between  you called out large project comps versus specifically how you serve the market being more selective there. The point being the latter might actually be stable or favorable to margins.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, and in terms of parsing the two, I'd say  I can't say that one was a more significant of an issue than the other. Both projects that did not repeat and being more selective around business that we take, both contributed to the decline in Q1. But I would say as we look forward and very much consistent with what we saw in the month of April, we think most of that's behind us at this point. And we're comfortable with our forecast for the year and our guidance for the year.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Great, thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Just on EPG I guess outside of Lighting. I guess the orders came in a little bit more sluggish. You cited industrial. Maybe just speak to the construction markets, res, non-res, any anomalies there and kind of how you think that the orders play out.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. I'd say that we really have not seen any dramatic changes from what we forecasted or anticipated in the Electrical Products businesses with the exception of perhaps a little bit of weakness we talked about in Lighting. Industrial markets continue to do fine. We think industrial markets are up 3% to 4%. Residential markets continue to be quite strong, so we think those markets continue to grow mid-single-digit. So we think by and large that our outlook for the year for our Electrical Products business and the key markets that they serve really have not changed much from our original guidance.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
And I might add, Jeff, it's early. We don't have a full accounting of orders for April but the orders for April appear to be pretty strong. So we're seeing a continuation of strong conditions in the product segment.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay great. And then just back on eMobility margins, is it right to think about for the foreseeable future we're in the low-double digits as you invest? Or do we start to move back up to a level we saw I guess in the last year period?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I would say that as we go through this kind of investment cycle which we think is really kind of a at least a couple-years kind of investment profile, we're going to be seeing margins at these levels. And you probably won't get back to the higher levels of margins until we get to a much higher level of revenue.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks guys.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Two questions. So following up on two of the topics. Number one on Lighting. From my math, it would seem to suggest that kind of core volume declines or  excuse me, core declines is close to 15% to 20% which is pretty significant.
Do you think there's going to have to be incremental restructuring or anything you're going to have to do internally that's going to be a lodestone to operating margin there? And could you comment qualitatively on any decremental leverage off that decline?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. I'm not sure how your math gets to those levels. Our Lighting revenues in Q1 were down 10%, and actually our profitability was essentially maintained. And so, we delivered margins that were very much in line with our expectations in Q1 on a 10% revenue decline.

And as we look forward, as I mentioned, we think Lighting obviously, on a go forward basis, we have much better quarters in front of us than we had in Q1. And we think the margins of this business continue to be very much in line with our expectations. And so we're not particularly concerned about a decremental margin issue in Lighting that's going to have any impact on our business at all.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
All right. I'll table those questions offline. I guess, then the next question is obviously a statement of drag. Going back to Julian's question about capital allocation, it would seem to me that obviously your preference is probably for M&A. But given this environment with where the stock is, there's a pretty significant market break here and kind of speed kills in terms of capital allocation and what you can do, particularly in the prevailing environment with cash repatriation, the strength of your balance sheet, the free cash flow generation. Don't you think there's going to be some upward bias to think about expanding this buyback pretty significantly? Because that seems to be the best use of your capital at this point in time.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. I just think at this point it's just too early to make a call on that, and because we promise, we will not allow cash to build up on the balance sheet. And to the extent that we don't have attractive M&A opportunities that deliver better returns, we'll certainly be very aggressive in buying back our stock.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thanks.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our last question for the day comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.
Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, guys. This is Chris Laserinko on for Andy. Just a couple follow ups and I wonder if I could zoom out a little bit for bigger picture. As we looked at the orders in the release, it seemed like there was a little bit of a slowing compared to the prior quarter's order growth rates. Is this mostly related to comparisons? Or are you seeing anything sequentially weaken as you work through the backlog?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. No, we're really not, and as Rick indicated, we're actually seeing some strength carried through in the month of April. And so, I'd say, there's always a little lumpiness in some of the businesses like Aerospace, so I wouldn't read anything into that. We came off of a very strong 2017 order input.
Hydraulics, a little less strong but our orders were up 22% in Q1 last year and we're up 14% on top of that. And many of this is simply a function of cyclicality or a function of what's in the denominator from last year. But no weakening at all. We're very confident that the order profile that we've seen so far this year is very much consistent with our guidance.
Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And I wonder if you could talk about company incrementals as a whole. Is the 40% target for the company as a whole still good? And I wonder if you could comment on what drove specifically the under leveraging in Q1. Also what you'd have to have in place to achieve it. Is that more volume related, price-cost related, combination of both, plus additional things that I might be missing?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, no. I think it's the things that you mentioned. It's volume leverage. It's price-costs where we're certainly much better balanced in the subsequent three quarters as I mentioned earlier. It's the net of restructuring spending and restructuring benefits. And so the incrementals that we delivered in Q1 were very much in line with our guidance for the year which ties out to a 40% incremental for the year. And we're very much committed to that number and that's very much consistent with what our expectations are for the year. We've seen nothing today in our businesses that will suggest that we will not deliver the 40% incremental.

Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And I wonder if I could sneak one in  since I'm the last one. In terms of the eMobility, could you comment on what the revenue ramp for the rest of the year looks like, and maybe about product introductions or leveraging the existing technology in the medium-term, in the next two years?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
There isn't going to be a gigantic ramp. You're going to see just a relatively modest ramp as you go through the quarters. And obviously we are working very hard on a whole variety of customer projects right now and that will impact a little bit the spending depending on whether we end up going forward on some of these projects. So those are the two dimensions.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
And I think largely it'll be tied to our customers and the rate at which they introduce new electric platforms. And so you'll clearly see a step function change in revenue in this business as the big global OEMs introduce new electric vehicle platforms. And so that's really the pacing item more than anything.
Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much for that. I appreciate the color.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
With that, it wraps up our call for today. As always Chip and I will be available for follow-up questions for the remainder of the day and into the rest of the week. Thank you for your time today.

Jamie Caulfield - PepsiCo, Inc.
Thank you, Operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our first quarter performance and full-year 2018 outlook and then we'll move on to Q&A.
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
When discussing our financial results on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items, such as the impact of foreign exchange translation, from our reported results. You should refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.
And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We will start off with an overview of the first quarter and a discussion of each of the operating sectors performance in a little more detail. And then Hugh will cover the full year outlook.
For the quarter, we delivered $12.6 billion of net revenue and core earnings of $0.96 per share. Within the P&L, gross margin was impacted by input cost inflation. Operating margin was further impacted by the front-line bonus we announced earlier this year. Foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of approximately 2 percentage points to both net revenue and reported EPS. And below the operating profit line, we benefited from a lower core effective tax rate.
The majority of our businesses performed very well in the quarter, excluding our North American Beverage division. In fact, excluding NAB, the company generated 4.6% organic revenue growth and 7% core operating profit growth, when excluding the one-time front-line bonus. However, our North American Beverages sector continues to work through some challenges.
So let's start with a discussion of NAB, separating long-term strategy from short-term executional issues. As you know, we've been transforming the business over many years, to build a product portfolio that meets consumers' desires through a repertoire of great-tasting beverages, especially beverages with fewer or zero calories, and in an assortment of packages that satisfies a broad range of occasions, from immediate personal refreshment, to family meal accompaniment, to social gatherings.

And our focused and sustained transformation initiatives at NAB have been very successful on multiple dimensions. We have shifted our product mix to faster-growing subcategories and provided more lower and zero sugar options, including recent innovations under the Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Propel, Lipton Tea House and Starbucks trademarks. Since 2010, we have increased our volume mix of non-carbonated beverages by 7 percentage points.
We have established and maintained strong leadership positions in many of the most attractive non-carbonated beverage categories, including ready-to-drink tea, ready-to-drink coffee and sports hydration and in the most recent quarter, grew value share in a number of the fastest growing categories, including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water.
We have increased our CSD package variety, so that our mix of non-traditional packages, that is, everything other than 2-liter and 20-ounce PET and 12-ounce cans, has increased from 14% in 2011 to 21% today.
We have reconfigured our supply chain to handle increased complexity and greater product assortment. For example, we have substantially increased flexible can line capacity. We expanded our co-pack (5:01) network to give us greater packaging flexibility in an asset-light model. And we're approaching having 60% of our route network converted to delivery via our GeoBox trailers, (5:11) and we have equipped many of our trucks with chillers to expand our chilled DSD network.
We have brought equipment innovation to market, providing product customization and convenience with our Spire fountain device and made nutritious options more broadly available with our Hello Goodness vending machines. And we have ramped up our R&D and innovation efforts to launch products that are on-trend with consumers.
For example, this February, we introduced bubly, a new flavored sparkling water with no artificial flavors, sweeteners or calories, and a brand and packaging that convey a playful and upbeat sense of humor.
And we recently launched Drinkfinity, now available online in the United States. This unique beverage system addresses growing consumer demand for customizable nutritious beverages in the most sustainable packaging.
We believe our strategy is sound and is positioning us well for the future; however, we are focused on the past three quarters, where our financial results have not lived up to our expectations for the North American Beverage business. So what is the issue? Simply put, while most parts of the business are performing well, recent losses in cola market share in North America have led to subpar top-line and bottom-line performance over the past three quarters. We have studied in detail the causes for the share loss across every dimension.
The overwhelming driver is that, despite moderately increasing our media on trademark Pepsi over the past three years, our share of voice has fallen dramatically relative to our key competitor, who has substantially stepped up their media spending on colas over the past two years.
To address this, we have allocated increased media to trademark Pepsi. And we have tightened and elevated our brand communication, beginning with the launch of our new Pepsi Generations campaign.
The campaign supports all the brands under the trademark Pepsi umbrella, and this will enable us to more effectively leverage the media investment across our full Pepsi portfolio.
Importantly, we plan to substantially and sustainably support the campaign throughout the year, while remaining disciplined on pricing. We are already seeing positive results from the campaign, with research telling us that the campaign is driving higher advertising recall, higher brand recall and higher brand regard with consumers. And our share performance has also begun to improve. These are important first steps. As we sustain the campaign, we anticipate it will translate to further improving sales and market share results.

Encouragingly, beyond trademark Pepsi, North America Beverages is performing reasonably well in the context of a highly competitive environment. Our tea portfolio under Lipton and Pure Leaf has over the past 17 quarters grown retail sales in the range of mid-single digits to as high as 21%.
Our enhanced water portfolio is performing well, with our premium LIFEWTR continuing to grow nicely as it enters the second year since its initial launch. And bubly's early results following its 2018 launch are exceeding our expectations. KeVita, our line of premium organic live probiotic beverages, grew retail sales 50% in Q1, following 66% growth for the full year 2017. And Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee grew retail sales 3% in the first quarter, following 4% growth in 2017, despite a number of new competitive entrants in the category.
Furthermore, we are pleased with both the improved trajectories and the outlook for both Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Both brands posted improved retail sales performance in the quarter versus the second half of last year. And our positive outlook for these trademarks are underpinned by robust 2018 innovation.
In January, we launched MTN DEW ICE, a clear lemon-lime flavored DEW made with a splash of real juice with just 100 calories per 12-ounce serving, and it is off to a strong start. Additionally, we expect our Summer 2018 limited-time offering of MTN DEW BAJA BLAST to perform well, especially relative to our DEW Summer 2017 LTO, which fell short of our expectations.
Also, this summer, we will launch Gatorade Zero. Gatorade Zero will address the large and growing demand by athletes for additional hydration options. We are introducing a Gatorade that provides all the hydration and electrolyte solutions of base Gatorade without the carbohydrates. Gatorade Zero will give our athletes more flexibility in combining hydration with other fuel sources to meet their overall sports hydration and nutritional needs. Taken together, we believe our plans will drive continued improved performance in the business.
Finally, beyond the strategic and execution actions I just mentioned, we continue to consider all available options to drive greater shareholder value from NAB.
Now moving on to Frito-Lay North America. We had solid performance, with balanced volume growth and net price utilization and continued strong market share results, driven by great marketplace execution, innovation and creative brand marketing. For example, building on the success of our 2017 launch of Lay's Poppables, an entirely new growth platform for Frito, we extended the Poppables product line-up with the introduction of new Lay's Poppables Honey Barbecue and a new 12-count multipack of Poppables Sea Salt.
We continue to drive net revenue growth through increased trial and household penetration, which, when combined with increased purchase frequency from the expanded product line-up and year long media support, should continue to scale up this promising new brand extension.
We have also extended success of our Simply sub-line by introducing new package varieties with the Simply variety pack and a three-flavor lineup of single-serve packages for Simply Lay's, Cheetos and Doritos offerings. The expanded package variety is enabling us to more fully capitalize on consumers' growing desire for organic non-GMO snacks with no artificial ingredients.
Demonstrating our focus on lifting and shifting successful ideas around the globe, we recently introduced Red Rock Deli to select markets in the U.S. Red Rock Deli has been a breakout success in Australia that addresses millennials' desire for high-quality food offerings, with credentials like Non-GMO Project Certification and no artificial flavors or colors.
Another example of lift and shift is our launch of the innovative Lay's Smile campaign, a concept that has its roots in a similar campaign we initially ran in China. This year, we are harnessing the power of sharing a smile and having a positive impact along the way.

With Lay's Smiles, we put more than 40 unique smiles on Lay's bags. And with each purchase of a Lay's Smile bag, donated a portion to Operation Smile. The photogenic and humorous elements of the campaign, combined with a compelling purpose-driven element, have driven terrific exposure for the brand through social media.
At Quaker Foods North America, our portfolio of Quaker branded products had mid-single-digit retail sales growth, boosted by the continued success of overnight oats and supported by a new ad campaign highlighting the functional benefits of oatmeal.
Let me now turn to our sectors outside of North America. We are pleased with the 8% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging markets as a group, which is an acceleration from the 6.5% growth we had in the fourth quarter of 2017. Stable to improving macro conditions, combined with strong market execution, have led to very strong growth across many of our key international markets. Within Latin America, organic revenue grew 10% in Mexico, high teens in Brazil and 20% in Argentina.
In AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, India, Egypt and Pakistan. The growth in the sector continues to be diluted somewhat by beverage tax-related declines in Saudi Arabia.
In our Europe Sub-Saharan Africa sector, Turkey and Poland organic revenue grew high teens, while Russia and South Africa grew mid-single digits. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw solid low single-digit growth in the UK and Spain, mid-single-digit growth in France and high single-digit growth in Germany.
Importantly, the strong top-line performance translated to impressive bottom-line results, with core constant currency operating profit up 9% in ESSA, 10% in AMENA and 17% in Latin America. The strong international results are, in part, a reflection of our initiatives to leverage our scale by increasingly coordinating commercial activities across markets and sectors. Example, with the increased global focus on zero-calorie beverages, we have continued to strengthen and scale our distinctive Pepsi Black under the MAX or Zero Sugar brands, depending on the market, which drove double-digit organic volume growth globally and the United States in 2017.
We have almost tripled our global footprint from 28 markets at the beginning of 2015 to 77 markets this year. We are leveraging our Pepsi Generations campaign internationally, airing our This is the Pepsi ad across 55 markets and the soccer-themed copy under the Generations campaign across more than 60 markets. And we have expanded Lay's Oven Baked to 14 markets, with plans to nearly triple that number in the next two years. And the Lay's Smiles campaign mentioned earlier has now been launched across markets in each of our sectors and grew retail sales mid-teens in the first quarter.
Net-net, we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing across many of our key international markets and solid financial performance by Frito-Lay North America. And although North American Beverages is in the process of a turnaround, we have plans in place that we expect will lead to improving performance.
With that, let me turn it over to Hugh.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'll just provide a quick update on the outlook, and then we'll move to your questions. From a macro perspective, we remain pretty positive. We see continued broad-based GDP growth, with developed markets stable and developing and emerging markets accelerating. And in most of our key markets, including the U.S., the picture is relatively positive, with strong employment, consumer spending and consumer sentiment data.
However, within this broadly positive picture, there remains a risk of geopolitical volatility in certain markets. From an industry standpoint, we continue to see pretty challenging conditions, including: dynamic retail and consumer landscapes; a very competitive environment; some currency volatility, most recently, in the Mexican peso, Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Brazilian real, and commodity inflation.

As Indra mentioned, within our businesses, the majority of our divisions are performing well, and we expect NAB's results to improve as the year progresses. So putting this all together, our guidance for 2018 remains unchanged. Specifically, we expect organic revenue growth at least in line with our 2017 growth rate, or 2.3%.
As we move through the year, our expectation is that we will continue to see some level of gross margin compression from inflationary input costs. Normally, you would see the gross margin contraction offset with SG&A productivity. But, as we shared with you in February, with the benefit of a lower effective tax rate in 2018, we are making investments to fortify the business, as well as fund the front-line bonus. And these investments will largely offset the productivity-driven margin improvement.
We expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s. And we expect core earnings per share of $5.70 or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23.
We continue to expect and we continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment in the business. For 2018, we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, and net capital spending of approximately $3.6 billion.
We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018, with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 15% increase in the annualized dividend per share starting with the June payment, and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion. And, as we mentioned on the last conference call, we still see the prospect for even higher cash returns as we begin to fully realize the benefits of greater global cash mobility beyond 2018.
Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following. We continue to expect our core constant currency EPS growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, as we will lap NAB's softer performance and natural disaster-related business disruptions in the second half. And we expect variability in the timing of productivity savings, investments, which includes the accrual of the front-line bonus, and net commodity inflation, to contribute to relatively better performance in the second half of 2018.
With that, we're ready to take the first question.

Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Dara.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. So, Indra, on the Beverage business, obviously a disappointing few quarters, I'd also argue if you go back longer-term, you could argue it's somewhat disappointing a performance, even including the solid results from back in 2015, 2016. And we continue to see this wide dichotomy between the snacks business performance and Beverages. You articulated that with the corporate ex Beverage numbers earlier.
So with all that as context, you mentioned all available options on the call earlier. And, as you think about that, is that more a sort of options and structure maybe that we've seen in the past, perhaps tweaked a bit for today's environment or is that seriously considering more radical changes? And I'm trying to get a sense for the level of sort of discontent within the organization around these Beverage results.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
So, Dara, that's a good question. So let me start off by saying, we are talking just about North American Beverages. As I look around the world, given some of the actions in many countries on beverage categories, selected beverage categories, we have actually performed quite well internationally in beverages, not just as PepsiCo, but the PepsiCo system, because our bottlers have their own beverage businesses, too. So if you look at the total, the beverage system of PepsiCo has actually performed extremely competitively.

The issue is in North America, and the issue is really the last three quarters. We look at the performance of the business constantly. If I look at it post the reinvestment we made in 2012, the business has actually performed quite well, very competitive, but performed quite well. And 2014 coming into 2015, 2016 and even the first half of 2017 was good. The last three quarters have been worrisome for us.
And let me talk a little bit about this, and I am reflecting back in the last 15 years of looking at North American Beverages, in particular. Whenever we have a competitive situation where somebody is going through a financial transaction with beverages, clearly, that creates room for reinvestment, which starts to perturb the competitive balance. And that's what we are seeing in the last three quarters, because of stepped up investment resulting from business model changes. The question is should we allow this to pass or should we step up and invest along with our competitor and that's a big question we asked ourself.
For three quarters, we said let it pass, because all of these have a timeframe. And once that temporary investment phase is over, the business comes back to a competitive equilibrium. But we don't want to be a net share donor, especially in CSDs, especially in colas. And so we'll go toe-to-toe and increase our spending in colas, in particular, but we're going to remain very responsible on pricing.
The key thing is this is a business that's highly competitive in North America. There's no question about it. It's a big business. It's a profitable business. Is it the same profile as salty snacks? No, but it generates a lot of U.S. cash, in the mid-teens profitability. I think that's a very, very attractive business in the staples space. And it gives you enormous clout with retailers because the velocity on this categories are phenomenal.
And I will tell you one thing. Anybody who is in the beverage business always wants to be in the salty snack business. And anybody who's in the salty snack business always wishes they had a beverage partner because you can't have a salty snack without a beverage.
So we have the combination together. We just have to keep making sure that our portfolio works. And that's what we are doing. We like (24:19) the fact that we have to go through these short-term issues with performance, but believe me, our team is maniacally focused on getting this business back to track in the second half of this year. And we will, sequentially improving every quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Lauren.
Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about productivity. The profitability outside the U.S. really accelerated, and productivity was highlighted kind of ranked first in the description of each businesses in the release. So could you talk a little bit about the balance of kind of productivity savings outside the U.S. versus within the U.S.? And as we go forward, should we expect more savings to come out of international and perhaps to start to see some margin build or are you still more prioritizing reinvesting, maybe pricing a bit below the rate of inflation to continue consolidating market share internationally? Thanks.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
You know, our goal is not to price below inflation. That's not our goal. What we're trying to do is build frequency and penetration. That's all we focus on in every market. And market-by-market is a function of what the nature of the competition is. Because in many of these markets, we have local competitors, too, and we have to think about our pricing architecture versus local competition.

So at every point in time, Lauren, we are looking across geographies to really figure out how best to grow the businesses. Is it frequency, is it penetration? Do we want to actually create a price umbrella for other local competitors to come in or do we want to remain with a price premium that's reasonable and allows us to build a business?
So while doing this, sometimes, we let productivity flow through. Other times, we reinvest it back in the business. So it's, again, literally a case-by-case basis. The net-net result of all of this is, as a company, overall, we are focused on productivity like you won't believe it.
We think all the digital technologies that are coming, all the new ways we can work to improve agility, improve flexibility, de-layer the company, there's so much we are looking at, is actually going to increase the productivity of our company. It's just that we have to make sure we have enough beta tests done with all the new technologies in the company, that when we roll it out across the company, they actually yield results, as opposed to flopping.
So we're in the process of doing all the beta tests now to make sure that they actually yield the kind of results that we're looking for. Rest assured, you might see short-term international productivity, but overall, we're looking at global productivity initiatives. Hugh, did you want to add anything?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.
No. I was just going to comment on that as well. The productivity balance won't change. It will be consistent across the globe.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Bryan.
Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, good morning, everyone. So I guess I want to follow-up on Dara's question, just about NAB. And I guess as you think about all the available options to drive greater shareholder value, would that actually include separating or selling NAB? Is the international business still important to have the scale benefits and you'd keep one and not the other or is that really not kind of what you're implying when you talk about all available options?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
That's not what we are talking about when we talk about all available options. The beverage business is still a global business. It's very linked, the North America business to the international business. And it's very linked to our snacks business. It provides very important scale in many important international markets and provides us a seat at the table with customers here in the U. S. So I think the beverage business is very important.
The real question we are asking ourselves is how best do we handle the operating aspects of bottling? We've gone back and forth between a separate company, part of PepsiCo. Is it best as a stand-alone public entity or is it best in the hands of multiple franchisees? The evidence is not clear. And we want to make sure we just don't engage in financial transactions for the sake of financial transactions, but whatever we do is really setting the company on a sustainable path.
So we're looking at what models exist out there. We're looking at what we did in the past. And we are trying to see how best to operate this very attractive, but very competitive beverage business that creates shareholder value and also does not detract from the overall performance of the rest of PepsiCo.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Good morning, Vivien.
Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC
So, Indra, I was hoping we could touch on Frito-Lay, please. Another solid print from the top line, but I was hoping you could touch on price realization. You did cycle quite a tough compare. But it does also look like in the scanner data, that there might be a slight softening in pricing, driven by competitive promotional activity. So if you just offer any color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.

Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
So Hugh?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.
Yeah, I'm happy to answer that. Good morning, Vivien. No, I would take the pricing as more temporary in nature. I think when we get to the end of 2018, you're going to see Frito-Lay pricing that's very much in line with what you've seen in the past. I wouldn't expect any dramatic dislocation in that regard. Quarter-to-quarter, price can wiggle a bit, but by the end of the year, you're going to see the same consistent Frito, both from a pricing perspective, as well as from a profit perspective, that you've seen in the past.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Caroline.
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Good morning. Thanks very much. Good morning, Indra. I'm wondering if I got this right, but it looks like your spending on A&M was down in the first quarter North American Beverages. If I did get that right, can you just help us, regardless, understand sort of the pacing of the spend behind this business? And which brands in particular, is it really very cola-focused? Are you going to be spending heavily on all your brands? And what the strategy is, just a little more to get us some confidence in a back half recovery.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Hugh, why don't you take it and then I'll follow up.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.
Yeah, happy to. Hey, Caroline. A couple things on that, number one, we kind of have to separate the accounting from the actual spending in the marketplace. From an accounting perspective, as, of course you know, A&M gets spread out on a curve. As the volume was a little bit softer in the first quarter relative to our expectations for the year, less of the spend would have been booked in the first quarter. And so you're seeing a timing difference in what appears in the books.
In terms of media spend in the marketplace, we were actually up strong double digits and strong double digits across the big brands. So I wouldn't over-focus on what the A&M showed up in the financial books. That's a product of GAAP convention. In terms of actual advertising in the marketplace behind the big brands, it was up significantly.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
And in terms of going forward, Caroline, which is the second part of your question, in most of the brands that we have, we're spending at very competitive levels, and they're all yielding the right results. The only place where we're outspent in the marketplace is in colas. And we were surprised by the extent to which media spending was taken up in colas by competition.
So we're going to step up our advertising behind trademark Pepsi, with a little bit of a focus on Zero Sugar and Diet Pepsi. And at the end of the day, we don't want to be a share donor. We want to be responsible in pricing. We want to be responsible in portfolio management, to go where the consumer is going. At the same time, being a share donor is not our cup of tea.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Ali.
Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. So I wanted to go back to pricing in North America Beverages for a moment. You may remember, we were quite vocal in pushing that price rationality is the best for shareholders in CSDs, at least. And, look, to your credit, you were early adopters of the sustainable price/mix that we've been seeing in CSDs in North America. But actually, now there's a little bit more controversy about it. I think I'd argued it's the biggest investment controversy we are hearing right now, certainly since Coca-Cola reported a couple days ago. And the controversy is whether price/mix will become more competitive or not.

Now to be clear, you reported pricing up in NAB. DPS reported pricing up in NAB, or their equivalent. KO had pricing down. I don't know if you listened to the call or not, but they excused it away with Easter compares and freight cost, oddly, and (33:26) price, et cetera. But investors are trying to figure out that controversy in particular. What will price/mix look like in North America Beverages for you, for your competitors, in the context of KO's, hopefully, confusion in terms of their pricing and your talk of reinvestment? I get that you're being clear in terms of being responsible on pricing; want to get a better sense of what that is, and how we should think about price/mix in North America Beverages going forward.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Again, mix is very important, because based on the mix, you'll see what the price realization is going to be. But, Ali, I'll tell you something. We've said this for several years now, and I'll repeat it. The message that all our NAB chaps (34:14) have is make sure that we never return to what happened in 2011, 2012 when there were $5 cubes. That's not going to happen. We want to make sure that, especially with inflation creeping into the business, we price to cover inflation. I think it's very important with the category growth of about 2%, that we play this market in a very responsible way, so that we don't further depress the category.
Now, here's a challenge. Single-serve clearly has better price realization. And as the mix of single-serve versus groceries shifts, clearly, you'll see some pricing perturbation. But from our perspective, we are watching grocery pricing very, very carefully. And we want to make sure we don't destroy the pricing architecture across the industry. And that's really the game we are playing. But we're not going to lose the game because of media spending, because at the end of the day, pricing discipline is one thing. But if it's a question of media spending to make sure that the consumer understands that Pepsi is still a strong, vibrant brand, we're going to spend on media.
And we are maniacally focused on making sure we use every opportunity with mini cans, with other packaging formats, to cover inflation to the extent we can, although that's difficult, but inch the pricing up. That's what we're focused on right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Indra, just a clarification for you and one for Hugh. When you talk about increasing spending on the colas in North America, are we talking about taking spending from other segments and putting it behind colas or are you thinking about just raising the overall bucket? And then for Hugh, Hugh, you talked about maybe potentially bringing more cash back. And when you talk about returning it to shareholders, are you thinking more of buyback or raising dividend maybe higher as well? Thanks.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
To your question, the first part, I mean, it's a little bit of both. Some of it will be reallocation, but some of it will be additional spending we'll put in. We are working through the details now, but the fact of the matter is, we are going to increase spending behind colas. Hugh, on the increased cash?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.
Yeah. So, Amit, we're still working through plans to bring cash back to the U.S. No change in 2018 guidance, either from a dividend or share repurchase perspective and as regards 2019, obviously, it's too early to talk about that. We'll talk about specifics of that as we get closer to next year.

Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.

Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Mark.
Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Good morning, Indra. Hi, Hugh. Also NAB; I know we're spending a lot of time on that, but it's important. Firstly, a clarification response to your response to Bryan's question, are you also saying refranchising is not on the table when you say you're not interested in hiving off beverage? And then also, Hugh, you mentioned strong double-digit increases on the big brands. Why do you think the volume didn't respond better to those increases?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
On refranchising or any other option, Mark, I didn't say no to anything. I didn't say yes to anything. All that I said was we're studying all of the options, because we have gone back and forth with the bottling business over the last decade or two.
And I don't believe just doing a financial transaction for the sake of short-term financial results is the optimal way to create shareholder value. What we are trying to see is, given the dynamics of this business going forward, given that the mix of products is likely to change, with more hot fill, more non-carbonated, more nutritious beverages coming on to the marketplace, how best do we manage the concentrate business versus the bottling business, so that we don't have to engage in a financial transaction every five or 10 years. That's what we are trying to do.
We are looking at structures that exists today to see whether they are operationally easy to execute or do they sound good in the short term, but they're very, very, complex and operationally a nightmare to operate. We're studying that. We're also looking at other structures, because I've always told you, the bottling business is a utility, low earnings growth, lots of cash. How do you operate the bottling business like a utility? What's the best structure to do that? That's what we are thinking through, stay tuned.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.
And, Mark, as regards to the increase in media spending, certain marketing levers work very quickly, distribution and price being the chief among them. Advertising and marketing, there is a building effect over the course of several quarters. So I think you actually did see some responsiveness in Dew, and even Pepsi improved a bit, but it's going to take a few quarters for the Pepsi business to fully respond to the increased advertising in the marketplace.

Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Andrea.
Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. Could you please comment on the cadence, I guess, I want to move back to the numbers, if we can, the cadence of the impacts of the commodities and transportation, and also, obviously the employee bonus, which I understand is a one-time effect and probably behind us. So and correct me if I'm wrong. So if you can help us reconcile as we go through the year against the $1 billion productivity per year, so if you can share some of what you're tracking year-to-date against that objective? Thank you.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.
Yeah, happy, Andrea, to talk a little bit to that, and certainly, you can follow up with Investor Relations to get into more of the details. Specific to your question, number one, the front-line bonus was entirely booked in Q1, so you see that in the numbers already. Number two, in terms of the commodity inflation, that'll be pretty consistent over the course of the year. And the productivity will equally be consistent relative to prior year over the course of the year. Of course, productivity always builds during the year, but prior year productivity also built. So that shouldn't be a dramatic difference.

Your next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.

Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Robert.
Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI
Great. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of help, and sorry to go back on North American beverages. But is it really as easy as just spending more money and driving share of voice or is it quality of the share of voice? And I'm just wondering if you can just kind of give us some metrics or some evidence of the work that you've done that it's purely a question of share of voice, that you have the right message. You just need to get it out more, and that the brands are essentially healthy. It's just you're being outspent.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Robert, we look at this all the time. Clearly, the quality of voice is important. You cannot just spend with a poor message. The message that we had the last two years, I don't think resonated as much. But the new Pepsi Generations campaign is resonating exceedingly well. It's scoring very high. The recall, the regard numbers are all extremely high. And as we go through the summer, you'll see more advertising for Pepsi Zero Sugar, Diet Pepsi as new products come in. You will see a trademark campaign, augmented with some specific additional messaging on Pepsi Zero Sugar and Diet Pepsi. And believe me, we are maniacally focused on the quality of the message to see if it's resonating with the traditional users, which tend to be more the boomers, and then recruiting the new people, which is the millennials.
And we are watching all of these cohort groups to make sure that the message is getting through, that Pepsi is a refreshing drink. It's great for fun times together, and it's great with food. And the recent campaign with Aaron Judge is gaining a lot of attention. And we feel good about the messaging. But at the end of the day, having a great message, but not conveying that regularly, especially with a competitor who is on air all the time, is not the right approach. And so we are going to step up the advertising, and we will constantly look at how it's resonating with consumers. And if we have to make a little tweak here and there, we'll do it.

Your next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Pablo.
Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Good morning. Hello, Indra. Look, just to follow-up on this North American Beverage commentary you've made, I mean, obviously, investment bankers listening on this call will be knocking on your door and giving you plenty of ideas and suggestions. But I want to make two questions. One, why do you really think that beverages, whether the concentrate, with or without bottling, gives you greater strength in terms of having a seat at the table? I could argue the opposite, right? That the poor performance in beverages maybe dilutes that seat when you're having discussions about Frito and all the great innovation you are putting through there. So maybe just remind us and convince us, why really having beverages, whether concentrate, with or without bottling, really helps.
And the second question, which is related to that, in the hypothetical scenario that you did not have beverages, tell us what do you think you could do better? I mean, I could argue that the relationship with Tingyi could be expanded. I could argue that you could be a lot more aggressive overseas in expanding your snacks footprint. And I could maybe argue in that you could do a lot more without beverages, but if you can comment on that. I mean, you have opened the door to these questions, of course, with the commentary that you made today. Thanks.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Pablo, first of all, the investment bankers have been knocking on our door forever. They have lots of great ideas. But at the end of the day, as I said, the ideas have got to make sense. They've got to make business sense and shareholder value sense. And we've been thinking through all of this a lot. Hugh, why don't you take the first part of the question and I'll come back and add to it?

Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.
Yeah, happy to. Good morning, Pablo. I would respectfully disagree with you on the notion that not having beverages would increase our sway or our influence with retailers. The fact is we're the number one food and beverage company in North America. We're the number two food and beverage company globally. We have impulse categories and expandable consumption. And we've consistently driven growth for our retailers because of the fact that we have impulse categories and strong brands, and they've been well marketed over time. So as our retailers are looking for growth, they inevitably come first to PepsiCo because of the size of the two businesses. It's not to say either one of them isn't a terrific business alone. We just think the two of them are better together, and I have a lot of evidence to support that. So I do think that the retailers value what we bring to the table in their entirety.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Again, Hugh, adding to your comment, in North America, if you take the biggest retailers, they do top-to-top meetings and a joint business plan session, maybe with three companies. And PepsiCo is a company that is a must do a top-to-top with because we are such a big part of the store, such a big part of the growth. And most large retailers will say, if PepsiCo doesn't grow, we can't grow because it's such a big part of the high velocity categories.
So our joint business plan, top-to-top meetings, may be one of the few where the senior-most leaders of the big retailers attend these meetings. Second, I go over to Europe, and individually, our businesses may be 37th or 50th in importance to a retailer. But together, we are in the top 10, but not just in the top 10, we are the fastest growing. And very often, we end up with top-to-top meetings with European retailers, and I attend many of them. And the reason that they ask for the top-to-top is because together, we drive a lot of the sales growth of the retailer, and we are high-velocity categories and bring the traffic in. And we are very innovative across both categories.
So I think that what we are looking at right now is a short-term performance issue with North American Beverages. We know exactly what needs to get done and we are off doing it. And we have come off three, four years of terrific performance. So we've got three quarters of performance miss and we are going to fix it, period.

Your next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Nik.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, good morning, everyone. Hi, good morning, Indra. I guess a lot of your commentary on the Beverage business has been around just stepping up marketing. But we haven't really talked about much on execution. And I'm just wondering, because if you're in the marketplace and you look at a refranchised Coke territory versus a Pepsi territory, you can see a very stark difference in terms of pre and post a refranchising for Coke. And so I'm just wondering. How can you compete in that type of situation where you have these independent franchisees just spending a lot more of their own capital in improving execution at retail versus a company-owned bottling operation? So I just was hoping you can give me some context around that as we think about some of the options you might have in the future.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
You're right, Nik. You know what? And this is just our observation, because we've studied all these in great detail. In the first couple of years of refranchising, when the parent company gives you a bit of a break, you're spending the parent company's money. After the first 18 months, it's your money that you have to spend. And right now, those independent bottlers are operating on very, very low margins. So the real challenge is going to be after the first 18 months after refranchising, are they going to be spending their own money off of lower margins already to do what they've been doing in the first 18 months post-refranchising where they got some breaks from the parent company.

I don't know. The jury is out. All that I tell you is, the evidence in a couple of cases where we've seen the first 12 months pass after refranchising, we are already seeing execution drop off significantly. Again, I'm not passing any judgment, I'm just giving you an observation. Believe me, what we are doing is studying their model in great detail. And if we believe their model makes sense, and if we believe that it's a model that can be executed without having to buy back the bottlers again in a few years down the road, the advantage is we can follow it easily. We are in studying mode at this point, along with all other options.

Morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Hi. I have a follow-on to an earlier question on price/mix, specifically on channel mix. Could you guys drill down a little on what you're seeing in terms of your businesses in the different channels in the quarter and then, your outlook for the rest of the year, and how that may positively or negatively impact your mix? And then, just to clarify, you do expect your price/mix to be positive this year, correct?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Go ahead, Hugh.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.
Yeah, good morning, Bonnie. First, we're seeing pretty consistent positive pricing across all of the channels. So nothing that you see in the IRI or Nielsen data is different than what we're seeing overall. Second, as regards the year, yeah, we absolutely expect pricing that's consistent with what we've seen in the past couple of years. The business pricing performance has been kind of in the 1% to 2% range; price/mix, it's typically been around 2%. I think that's probably a reasonable assumption for us. Again, all subject to what happens in the marketplace, but that's, I think, what you can reasonably expect.

Your next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Morning, Steve.
Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good mornings, Indra. Thank you. Building further on the discussion of snacks and beverages belonging together, as you think about the path to improvement in NAB, I'm just wondering what the role, the relationship with Frito-Lay is expected to play in that improvement. Because as I listened earlier to the plans for NAB improvement, there definitely seem to be many NAB-specific initiatives underway. But in the context of a broader better together Power of One strategy, I guess I continue to be somewhat surprised there aren't more joint snacks and beverages efforts being prioritized, such that Frito's enduring strength can theoretically lift Beverages. Is that just a misconception on my part, that there aren't more or there isn't more explicit cooperation between the two businesses or is there evidence that joint beverages versus snacks execution still remains elusive? Thanks.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
Oh, great question, Steve. I'd say that there's stuff that happens together behind the scenes and stuff that happens that's visible to all the consumers. For the big holidays, you do see joint promotions. The idea of Power of One is not to force joint activity, even if it doesn't (51:58) make sense, because, sometimes, just based on the marketing calendar with various retailers, Frito and Pepsi may be on deal at different times. So we have to be very, very careful that we don't force deal activity when it doesn't make sense. But Super Bowl was an example where the two came together in a significant way.
But let me speak behind the scenes. We talked about the joint business planning. We talked about technology transfer. Frito-Lay had GES. NAB had GeoBox. (52:26) They're all the same technology. So we negotiate with suppliers in one place. We have the same chassis for both Beverages and Frito-Lay. The go-to-market system shares all the best practices between the two entities.

When we think about customer management, customer databases, how you think about managing the whole customer relationship, we have Power of One customer teams. Our Walmart team is one team. And so behind the scenes, in dealing with the customers, we are one company. From a execution and a shelf perspective, we do displays and joint activity when it makes sense. Foodservice, we go together as much as possible. We do have joint programs between beverages and snacks. That gives us a much better seat at the table for many foodservice negotiations.
Then our Hello Goodness vending machine, which we're now rolling out pretty fast, that's got both beverage and snack better-for-you, good-for-you options in the machine. And that's what's allowing us to win university accounts because they love the fact that we're putting in good-for-you, better-for-you products in machines. And there's both snacks and beverages, and we take care of fulfilling it.
And so I think there's lots going on behind the scenes. Your question sounds like music to my ears because I'd like to do more and more and more. But you've got to be a little bit careful that you don't do Power of One for the sake of Power of One. You do it because it makes sense, in terms of driving sales or lowering costs.
Then talent, one thing I shouldn't forget. The great thing with NAB is, because it's so competitive, if you take a Frito-Lay person, put them in North American Beverages and send them back to Frito-Lay, they're much better executives because they now really learned what it is to be in a dogfight. And so from a talent development, we actually like NAB as a wonderful talent development area where you really earn your stripes for playing in a highly competitive sort of not just large competitors, but a whole bunch of small competitors, and how you navigate that whole minefield.

Quick points of clarification and then a broader question on sports drinks, but the clarification is on NAB and the strategic considerations. So, Indra, is there a timeline here that will govern the process? In other words, will investors know next quarter, by year-end, et cetera? So if you could just build on that, I think that would be helpful for people.
The broader question I have, though, is on the Gatorade business and your view for the sports drink category. Trends have slowed there, seemingly on health and wellness concerns. Gatorade's lost some market share, despite higher levels of investment. Can you discuss, Indra, your outlook for the Gatorade business now, how that possibly may have changed over the past year or two, and your level of confidence that new product innovation can improve your trends? Thank you.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.
The first question  and, Hugh, I'll make some comments. If you want to add something, please do. Look, looking at the best way to operate North American Beverages is not something new. We've been talking about it for the last two years on the call. So we always look at it and say, hey, what's the best way to create value. And that's something we're maniacally focused on. And we've studied other companies' activities. We've looked at creative options on our side.
But, again, we have to make sure whatever we do does not take us back to the old system of having problems between the bottling company and the concentrate company, because this is a big, attractive category. And so there is no timeframe, Kevin. When we get to a place where we think it makes sense to do something, we'll share it with you. But at this point, we're not going to give you any date because we don't know. We haven't come up with the solutions yet. We're still studying.

In terms of Gatorade, the business is still very, very strong. This is like the ready-to-drink coffee business. When some new competitor comes in and decides to drop the pricing substantially and take some share from distribution, the leader, especially the leader like Gatorade, has to be very judicious in not trying to compete on pricing. And so what happens is, we allow some distribution build to happen. Then we watch to see what happens to velocities of that product. And right now, what we are seeing is, there is some competition in sports drinks.
But after the first distribution build, velocities are dropping off. And if some of these companies are actually preparing for sale, you do see them taking on some actions that are not sustainable in the long term. In those cases, Gatorade just has to be very responsible and very careful in its response. It's got to be surgical, and that's what we are doing. We are watching Gatorade shares like a hawk. And whenever we have a competitor that's trying to build distribution through pricing, there's a point or two that we might lose, but we always gain it back. It's still the strongest franchise in sports nutrition, bar none.

Good day. My name is Lateef and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.
Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update. We'll start today's call with an overview of our Q1 results and our 2018 plans from Bernardo Hees, our CEO; and David Knopf, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, Paulo Basílio, President of our U.S. Zone; and Georges Zoghbi, Strategic Advisor and Director, will join the rest of us for the Q&A session.
Please note that, during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation available on our website.
Now let's turn to slide 2, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that we're feeling more confident about our outlook with Q1 in line to slightly better than our expectations from the February call. If you recall, there were several factors that lead us to be cautioned on our top-line performance for the first half of 2018, including the headwinds in United States from Planters and Ore-Ida, the impact from retail inventory reductions in Canada, and the weak result in Brazil from our SAP implementation.
At EBITDA, we spoke about near-term pressures in the United States and the Rest of World from accelerated investments in go-to-market capabilities, Big Bet launches, and increasing working media dollars, and best-in-class customer services, as well as significant cost inflation, especially freight at the beginning of the year.
On the whole, it played out as expected. And we continue to expect many of these same factors to remain in Q2, as were anticipated in the outlook we provided in the February call.
Outside these transitory factors, we are seeing ongoing improvement in consumption trends in most countries and in most of the key categories that we believe will drive both top and bottom-line growth into the second half of the year. These include positive trends in the first quarter  it's actually the fourth quarter  in categories such as natural cheese, meals and desserts, and ready-to-drink beverage in United States; cheese and coffee in Canada; condiments and sauces across Europe; soups and meals in the UK; and baby food in Russia; condiments and pasta sauce in Latin America; as well as soy sauce in Indonesia.

More important to highlight for the balance of 2018, for 2019 and beyond, is that these gains are being driven by the investment and progress we are making to build capability for sustainable advantage to our iconic brands.
On slide three we show six goals from our framework presentation that is set to fulfill The Kraft Heinz vision to become the best food company, growing a better world. For instance, we set a goal to be the English number one in marketing capabilities and we are investing in our portfolio of brands to a data-driven approach to win with consumers.
It's fair to say that we have spent the last two years on the necessary renovation of our portfolio largely by focusing on marketing spend efficiency and product renovation. We are playing more offense with higher commercial investments especially behind incremental innovation. In data-driven marketing, we continue to develop proprietary in-house tools to better measure quality impressions across new mediums like mobile, and to understand the impact that our digital initiatives have on net sales, all at a faster real-time pace.
In the first quarter alone, our Super Bowl ad kicking off the Kraft Maxwell brand campaign generated more than 2 billion impressions. We executed a data-driven target digital campaign in UK soups helping us gain more than a point of share during strong soup season in gross sales 10%.
Also in UK, our company behind a new announced product, chocolate flavored mayo during Easter season generate 3.5 billion impressions for Heinz Seriously Good Mayo. Think about that, more than 3 billion impressions in a country one-fifth the size of the United States, and in a classic definition of adaptable data-driven marketing, our U.S. team's quick response around consumer and social media interest in Mayochup generated more than 1 billion impressions within 48 hours. This coming at a time when we are just launching Heinz Real Mayonnaise in United States and Canada.
In innovation, we are pushing into new categories, new segments, new occasions, in many cases to premium positioning and we are doing this with a focus on incrementality, not just gross sales from new items. In the United States for instance, our innovation funnel has got wider every single year, and in 2018, we plan to launch roughly 60% more innovation projects than we did in 2016. And more launches are designed to be incremental to our current base, such as breakthrough innovation in new dayparts like we're doing with Just Crack an Egg for breakfast, a refrigerated product that's now selling faster than we can make it.
Disruptive innovation like Heinz Premium Mayonnaise and building on our presence in snacking by complementing P3 with Oscar Mayer Natural Meat & Cheese Plates, Philadelphia Bagel Chips and Cream Cheese Dips, and Planters Signature nuts. As well as partnering with growing equities to bring specialty items to market with our new Springboard platform and through joint ventures. Items like Momofuku sauce, Oprah O, That's Good! Comfort Foods, and Food Network Meal Kits and Cooking Sauces.
Outside of the United States you are already seeing the impact of incremental sales from the Kraft brand in Europe and should soon see the same in Australia. And in our Rest of the World market we expect gains from whitespace launches under Kraft, Heinz and Planters to show more strongly in the second half of the year in our effort to maximize category managers will have significant impact still ahead.
At retail in the United States, for instance, we still have room to improve the effectiveness of our promotional activities. We expect key summer and winter reset windows to improve SKU adoption, distribution and velocity through our assortment management and planogram tools.

In U.S. foodservice, we have started to streamline our product catalog, emphasizing high-velocity SKUs, which also reduce supply chain complexity. And across our zones, we recently made our Global Center of Excellence in the Netherlands our global hub for assortment management, adding this capability to the revenue management team to drive value and growth.
In go-to-market capabilities, we continue to take actions that will enable us to improve our ability to get the right product at the right place, at the right time for our consumers and capture what we believe to be significant incremental organic growth. Our in-house in-store sales teams in the United States is now 80% larger than this time last year, and we are seeing the incremental returns we expect versus the previous focus-only approach in store everywhere we have implemented this new model.
In foodservice, we are capturing whitespace opportunity in some of our most developed markets, the United States and Europe, a good indication that there is more untapped potential in this channel. And in e-commerce, our theme is developing in-house data science and consumer analytics expertise with a focus on building consumer baskets that together with single-item purchase can leverage the breadth of The Kraft Heinz portfolio and make it a better partner to our retail customers.
We are also making significant progress in our goal to create best-in-class operations. We are pacing ahead of aggressive industry-leading targets in quality, safety and customer service in nearly all geographies we operate, even as we ramp up to get new state-of-the-art factory in Davenport, Kirksville, China and Brazil producing to their potential.
And on costs, while inflationary pressures have continued across procurement, logistics and manufacturing, we view the solid pipeline of projects in each area to minimize these pressures which should come true in the second half of the year. In other words, even though we've substantially complete our integration program in Q4, we remain in a strong position to both offset cost inflation and fuel high-return investments in our brands.
These include investing in the develop of our people, where in the first quarter alone, Kraft Heinz employees completed nearly 60,000 courses through our interactive university online platform. We cannot underestimate how critical it is in this rapidly changing environment to develop our people to new competencies and SKU building in areas like sales, marketing, leadership, problem-solving and R&D, because we know that our people are what really made Kraft Heinz to adapt to these new times and to win in the marketplace.
So to summarize, one, we are building capabilities to create brand and category advantage to achieve profitable growth. Two, we're investing aggressively now in order to see the benefits sooner. And three, these are key factors shaping what's likely to be on a typical balance of net sales and EBITDA between first half and second half in 2018.
So let me hand over to David to explain how these factors impact Q1 results and how the commercial momentum we are investing to build is likely to play out in our financials.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thank you, Bernardo, and hello, everyone. Turning to slide 4, from a total company perspective, organic net sales were down 1.5 percentage points in Q1, consistent with the expectations we laid out on the last call. Pricing was positive for the third consecutive quarter, up 1 percentage point and driven by favorable pricing in the United States and Rest of World markets. Volume mix was 2.5 percentage points lower in Q1, due to known headwinds in the United States and Rest of World markets that overshadowed solid retail growth in EMEA and Canada, strong Easter programming in the United States and foodservice growth in both the U.S. and EMEA.

By segment, the U.S. was slightly better than our initial expectations, Planters and Ore-Ida had a negative 1.5% impact, and trade spend timing was a 1.2% headwind to Q1 net sales. Excluding these factors, underlying U.S. consumption was significantly better than reported results and continued to show sequential improvement.
In Canada, as expected, results reflect earlier go-to-market agreements with key retailers, with growth tempered by retail inventory reductions at a key retailer, versus the end of 2017. EMEA had a strong first quarter, driven by soups and meals growth in the UK, as well as condiments and sauces growth across the zone, including southeast and central Europe, where we are now selling the Kraft brand. And in the Rest of World, top line growth was supported by pricing, while vol mix was held back by distribution-related issues, primarily re-alignment in Mexico and continued disruption in Puerto Rico, a seafood shortage in Southeast Asia that is impacting our canned business in Indonesia and the implementation of SAP in Brazil.
That said, we do expect sequential improvement moving forward. At EBITDA, Q1 performance was slightly better than expected, although the drivers were consistent with our expectations, specifically solid gains from productivity savings and net pricing, gains that were offset by inflationary pressures, primarily elevated freight and resin costs, as well as cost associated with our aggressive commercial investment agenda. At adjusted EPS, we were up $0.05 versus Q1 last year, driven primarily by a roughly 730 basis point reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate versus Q1 last year, while other below-the-line items largely offset one another.
One final note I'd like to make about Q1 results that's not on the page is our cash generation. In Q1, we delivered nearly $500 million of additional cash versus the year-ago period. This came from a combination of lower capital expenditures, lower cash taxes and lower working capital.
In sum, our Q1 financial performance was in line to better than expected and provides a solid start to delivering our full-year outlook outlined on slide 5. To start, we continue to expect 2018 will be a year where just less than half of our net sales and EBITDA will be delivered in the first half of the year and more than half in the second half. And this is compared to 2017, where net sales and EBITDA were roughly equally split between first half and second half. In fact, in Q2, while the set of sales and cost headwinds will be similar to Q1 and we will continue to press our aggressive commercial investment agenda, we will be up against our strongest EBITDA comparisons of the year in every reporting segment versus last year.
But as Bernardo said, with four months now behind us, we are gaining visibility on a number of trend-bending drivers, both commercially and operationally that are giving us confidence in a strong second half and solid momentum heading into 2019. To be more specific, we see four tangible drivers of the turnaround in the second half of 2018. First, the transitory headwinds in the U.S. during the first half should not just fade but are likely to turn into positive year-on-year contributors, given strong go-to-market plans for Planters nuts, Oscar Mayer cold cuts and our frozen business.
Second and also in the U.S., we expect to begin seeing more benefit from the investments in category management and go-to-market capabilities, benefiting both the strong innovation agenda we have planned as well as our in-store presence with key customers. Third is international growth, driven by a combination of innovation and whitespace initiatives in virtually every market, Canada, EMEA and Rest of World. And, fourth is leveraging greater net savings as the benefits from the initiatives we have at work across procurement, logistics and manufacturing ramp-up.

From an overall perspective, we remain confident in delivering positive constant currency EBITDA growth and strong adjusted EPS growth for the full year, as we outlined in February. And to be clear, we're targeting EBITDA growth versus the revised 2017 base, following the new accounting standards we've implemented.
For earnings per share, we now expect an incremental $40 million of depreciation and amortization versus $70 million previously and we continue to expect incremental interest expense of roughly $100 million versus last year and an effective tax rate of approximately 23% for the full year. And in terms of cash generation as evidenced by our strong Q1, we continue to expect a significant step up in cash generation from a combination of lower capital expenditures, lower cash taxes and lower working capital.
To close, I'd echo Bernardo's earlier thoughts on the year in our path forward that we're developing capabilities to create brand and category advantage to achieve profitable growth, that we're investing aggressively now in order to see the benefits sooner, and that these are the key factors shaping what is likely to be an atypical balance of net sales and EBITDA between the first half and the second half in 2018.
Now we'd be happy to take your questions.

Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good evening. You mentioned your investments in feet on the street, the sales in stores. Could you talk about where you are with those investments? Have you seen returns in that and can you give us a sense that you're feeling confident you'll get something for that investment?
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Sure, David. Hi. This is Paulo. So, yes, we're deploying this different in-store coverage model that it basically involves replacing some existing third-party merchandises that we own, we have in our stores to in-house salespeople. What we believe that we can better execute and understand the category needs with that, and we have leveraged advanced analytics, we are forming the metrics to track this activity. We started doing this in 2017. I can guarantee you that it's being up and we're actually doubling down on this.
David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And just a question on your  the big four, cheese, nuts, lunchmeat and coffee, those categories have that pass-through element. They've been four categories for you which your brands have been wobbling in terms of their market share lately. It looks like private label has been the beneficiary in some of these. Could you tell us what's going on? Is it something of a price timing issue or is there something else with regard to your promotion strategy that you're looking to adjust? Thanks.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, David. This is David. Thanks for your question here. So let me step back on pricing a little bit and let me give you some more color on Q1 and then going forward. So in Q1 we realized a fair amount of carryover pricing from last year, so you saw that we were up 1% overall for Kraft Heinz and this is really in the places that we planned, okay, outside of key commodities, so this is something that will likely last going into the rest of the year.
Outside that pricing, pricing out of commodities was pretty stable for the quarter and we expect that to maintain stability going forward, so that's kind of our Q1 pricing. Going forward as a matter of practice, we don't talk about potential future pricing actions, so I won't get into that but what I will say is we continue to be very confident in the strength of our brands and we will continue to strike a balance between market share and profitable volume for each of our categories.

David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your question, please.
Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Two for me if I can. You talked about the headwinds in 2Q. I just want to make sure I understand what the message is there. Typically, if you look at seasonality, EPS, EBITDA in 2Q, they've been around 10  EPS anyway about $0.10 higher than 1Q. This is exactly what the Street's modeling today, $0.99 versus $0.89. So I know you can't give guidance, but I just want to make sure we're hearing you correctly on what that similar headwinds comment meant, right? Does it mean that we should expect similar EBITDA or could seasonality still lift 2Q's EBITDA ahead of 1Q like it typically does?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hey, Ken. This is David. Thank you for the question. So as I said earlier, 2018 is likely to be a bit less first half, a bit more in the second half, and that compares to the roughly 50/50 split that we had last year in 2017.
So obviously shifting very few percentage points can cause significant year-over-year percentage changes. And on top of that, particularly in Q2, given what we're up against in terms of having the strongest EBITDA comparisons on a margin perspective last year in every geographic segment. So that's something that will be relevant for next quarter.
That being said, again, I think there are three very highly tangible drivers to our kind of second half outlook. First, as I said, the transitory headwinds in the U.S., including nuts, cold cuts and Ore-Ida. These are three significant factors that should fade into the second half. Second, we have a very strong innovation pipeline and whitespace agenda across the company this year that I think EMEA is actually already kind of proving out for us, and that will gain traction in the U.S., Canada and Rest of World.
Finally, on the bottom line, our savings curve should catch up to inflation that we've seen in the business and the investments that we've made in the business as the year progresses. So that's kind of, again, our breakdown for the year. And again, just to kind of reiterate what we said, the capabilities we're building in category management, brand-building, and go-to-market that we're investing this year aggressively, this will benefit us both later into 2018 and will benefit us in 2019 and going forward.
Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you for that. And my follow up is you mentioned, I think, if I heard you correctly, as the management team, you're going to have 60% more, and I thought I heard the phase innovation projects than a year ago. I wanted to understand what's an innovation project as you define it, and how do I reconcile the talk of 60% more projects with the sort of Big Bet strategy you've told us about in the past? Thanks.
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Ken. This is Paulo. What I can talk about the U.S. innovation pipeline here. So what I can tell you is that when I compare year-over-year the number of projects and the number of dollars that we are seeing coming from innovation for  that we expect to have innovation in 2018  is growing versus 2017 and has many examples now being launched and being shipped. We have in all of these projects, one another driver that we are incorporating here. We are very focused on the incrementality of the innovation that we are launching.
So we have the Just Crack an Egg, Heinz Mayo is coming, Planters Crunchers, our partnership with Food Network, a lot of new dressings. We have the Capri Sun base renovation. And on top of that, we are already entering Q2, we have 19 refrigerated and soft frozen meals, and also a very strong pipeline in frozen meals that we brought from the second half. So again, we are very happy and confident with the U.S. innovation pipeline that we already got distribution in 2018.

Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Just to complement Paulo, adding to the rest of the work, you're going to have the same, the similar story that's an extension of a number of projects, right, renovation and incrementality in a set of projects that we call the Big Bet strategy, Ken. That's why it's all totally connected. That's what we call the platform launch, right?
Just to name a few on the international market, we have MAX Boost in Canada. We have several in Kraft territory in Europe, right, now coming to Australia as well. We have Jif Jaf cookies in China. I have the entire Heinz baby food renovation in Europe and Asia. I have the premium line in soy sauce in Indonesia, pasta sauce in Japan. So those are some of key platform renovation that match to the Big Bet concept that you just addressed. At the same time, we are widening our innovation pipeline worldwide.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi. Your line is open.
David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Great. Thank you, and good evening. I wanted to ask about gross margins. Can you talk a little bit about how gross margins trended by region? And then specifically, I'd like to understand if retailer pressures are constraining the gross margins and then if it's a developed or emerging market pressure?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, David. This is David. Thank you for the question here. So as you know, broadly we manage EBITDA dollars not to margin, whether it's EBITDA margin or gross margin. So, we're very focused on growing our EBITDA dollars. That being said, in Q1 you saw our gross margin overall was essentially flat versus prior year. I think two things to note on that. One, we did have a small benefit from the timing of pension and post-retirement costs and this is something that's not going to repeat, and, two, we did have another small benefit from a mix impact from a Easter shift into Q1 from Q2 that's going to work against us next quarter.
Going forward, again, I'd expect sales growth to improve before EBITDA growth and before EBITDA improves and again, coming back to the fact that we have inflation coming into this year, and the accelerated investments that we're making in the business that run ahead of our savings curve, and the ramp-up in our commercial growth.
David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
David, though, can you just comment on a little bit on the regions? I mean, one of the most talked about issues right now in the sector is the potential pressure on gross margins and a comment on the U.S. business. I mean, the sales growth is weak so we're all wondering here. I mean, I hear what you're saying about the back half of the year, but just like your sense as to the current environment and is this pressure something that, do you actually think it would constrain your ability to manage your margins over time?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Yeah, no. So again, I'm not going to speak to gross margin by segment or by zone for us, but again we're happy with the performance in Q1. We're running consistent with our plan for the year, and again, that plan is going to be very second half weighted with the three kind of tangible drivers that I talked about with the headwinds in the U.S. including nuts, cold cuts and Ore-Ida abating through the year with the strong innovation and whitespace agenda in EMEA and rest of the world and U.S. and Canada, and our savings curve that should catch up with inflation and investments.
David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.

Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hi. Thank you for the question. I was hoping that you could help me understand how your relationships with the trade have evolved. Last year, there were a series of service issues on Ore-Ida and then you also had some  I would say some pushback from a major retailer on their pricing scheme for private label and cheese and meats and then you had the Davenport issue. So are all these issues kind of being resolved now? And do you feel like the retailers have given you a clean slate and that's why you feel confident that you're seeing a bit of a tipping point here in terms of your distribution trends, your innovation trends, and your programs? Or are those issues weren't that big to begin with? Thanks.
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi. Hi, David. This is Paulo. Hi, Rob. It's Paulo here. So, again, what I can tell you is that when you think about our service level for this year we had a big improvement. As you know, the majority of the footprint work is now behind us, so, again, we started the year with a very good and a strong service level. We have this focus issue in capacity from Ore-Ida, but beside that, all of our products and capacity we are delivering and aligned what our customers they demand. So, again, we feel it's going to place some service constraints in Ore-Ida, but overall my total service level and the ability that we are seeing to engage with the customers, to get our innovation distribution, to get our products there, to get  to negotiate and staff our JVPs (32:49) really well, so we're feeling good about this relationship for the year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is open.
Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good afternoon, everybody.
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Good afternoon.
Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. I guess I read some comments the other day from a recent conference that were made by Jorge Paulo Lemann and basically acknowledging that 3G bought brands that they thought could last forever as he put it, but then all of a sudden got disrupted and those were kind of his words. And I realize some comments can be taken a bit out of context and such, but I guess I was hoping to, first, get your take on these comments. It's hard to know, kind of, what to make of them.
And then second, maybe better understand how thoughts like this inform or impact certain capital allocation decisions for KHC. I guess, in other words, does this disruption make slower growth staple assets less interesting, even if compelling transactions from a financial standpoint?
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thanks, Andrew. It is Bernardo. Look, let me try to address your question directly, right? I think the disruptive market and changing channels consumer habits and so on, that's happening for quite some time and that's something we have been in knowledge also for some time, right, a significant part of our commercial investments, right, that we announced at the end of last year. The $250 million to $300 million is behind new digital initiatives, right, behind e-commerce, behind new channels, behind go-to-market, behind the innovation that's coming to market to support it and behind working dollars in media as well as service.
With that being said, I think, the big message here is really that there will be  we cannot have any compliance with the brands we have. It's actually the opposite. We believe in the big brands when you support them, right? When you give them the right relevancy, the right product offering in the marketplace, they go really well. It's the case, for example, if you think about Heinz in the United States, it has been growing 15% every year since 2015. The re-allowance of the Kraft brand with the Super Bowl campaign, with family greatly is giving us a lot of excited behind Kraft's new offers in cheese and other segments that can be very relevant.

But it's also true to say that these big brands that have the scale, that have the profitability, right, they will need to come with new offers from different angles and different categories for smaller brands and so on. And we are doing that if you think about the case of DEVOUR on the frozen territory. If you think about Just Crack an Egg going for breakfast in refrigerated, right? If you think about the things we are doing with brands like Classico, like Cool Whip, like A.1, right. If you think about the extension of the Planters with Planters Signature and NUT-rition, right? So the combination of the two things are extremely important. So in a sense to your question, it's changed our capital allocation, mindset. My answer, it's no.
Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay.
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Actually, I think it's very in line with what we have been saying for quite some time, right? Our framework for capital allocation, organic and inorganic, has not changed. We continue to like big brands. We continue to like business that can travel and continue to like business that we can generate efficiency that can be invested behind growth, brands, products and people.
Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much for that color. One quick follow-up. If you expect some of the similar topline impacts in 2Q as in 1Q, plus you'll have an added headwind from the Easter shift that reverses a little in 2Q, I guess, does that suggest that 2Q organic sales could be weaker sequentially compared to 1Q? Or would you expect some sequential improvement, even with the Easter shift hurting you? Thank you.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Andrew, this is David. Thanks for the question there. So let me walk through a little bit zone-by-zone or geography-by-geography for Q2 on the sales side. So from a topline perspective in the U.S., we expect to be kind of sequentially similar to Q1. Okay? So we still expect to see the impact of headwinds from Planters and Club and from Ore-Ida and cold cuts, as we've talked about. And again, this will be about 1.5 percentage point headwind for us. In addition to that, we have a combination of trade phasing and the Easter shift, the reverse that we saw in Q1, which combined should be about 1 point headwind for us. So overall, pretty similar to what we saw in Q1.
If you look for each of the other zones in Canada, we will see the most difficult Q2 comparison driven by three factors. So first, we had retailer inventory kind of rebuild in Q2 that we will be lapping, and this was particularly strong in cheese. Two, we had a strong summer 2017 programming, which is primarily in our condiments business. And three, the fact that our innovation pipeline in 2018 is a little more second half weighted than it was in 2017. Okay?
And then if you look to the Rest of World, we expect to see kind of sequential improvement through the year of the investments we're making and that we accelerated in 2018 really materialize. And then in Europe, I'm excited and continue to be confident in our strong growth for the year.
Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Your line is open.
Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC
Thank you very much, guys. Following up on Andrew's question, should I ask really simply with all the cross-currents going on, competitors struggling, valuations coming down but the 10-year coming up 50 basis points, would you say it's a better, worse, or unchanged outlook for you as you look at the likelihood and attractiveness of doing acquisitions is my first question?
And secondly, if higher freight costs remain or continue to get higher, does that at all threaten things like outsourcing, you co-manufacturing, you consolidating plants, the kind of cost savings initiatives you've been so successful with over the past couple of years? Thank you.

Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Jonathan. Here's Bernardo addressing the first question you had about M&A. I really don't think it changed the framework and the way we think about that. We are very long-term focused, right. We are very disciplined in the approach we have about M&A, really looking at things as two plus two is more than four. Like I mentioned in the question before, our framework to look that of liking brands, business that can travel, and synergies that can capture that allows us to reinvest is still in place.
So I don't think those movements you're talking about in stock price get in the way or interest rates get in the way of this framework in this long-term framework. What is right that you said the devaluations you're seeing today are more attractive than we have seen six months ago and 12 months ago, even for us in a relatively basis.
Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC
Thank you. And on freight?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Jonathan. This is David. Let me take freight for you. So I'll split this into kind of two pieces. So first up on footprint, when we did the initial modeling on each of these footprint projects, we took into consideration potential kind of variable changes, whether it's fuel or other kind of costs that could potentially cause fluctuations going forward. And I'd say all that being the case, we're still very happy with what we did on the footprint side.
Second, in terms of kind of inflationary pressures we're seeing, so not surprisingly we are seeing inflationary pressures similar to what some of our peers have talked about, whether it's in packaging, whether it's in oil or freight. But what I will say is while these costs are definitely higher, we certainly feel it's manageable within the context of our savings curve. And we're still kind of on plan to our 2018 targets despite that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Your line is open.
Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna International Group of Companies
Thank you very much, and good afternoon everyone. Look, Bernardo, my question is more about balance sheet flexibility. If you can comment in terms of potential asset divestitures that give you flexibility to fund future deals, remind us of how high can you go in terms of debt leverage post a deal. And also would there be a scenario where Kraft Heinz could end up with a dual class share structure in the future, so your controlling group can keep control as the equity base expands?
And the second follow-up maybe for Paulo Basílio. I hear a lot about innovation, about different products, Capri Sun, Oscar Mayer and other things, but nothing really about coffee. Just give us an update in terms of where you are in coffee with lots of innovation from obviously Keurig, Smucker's and other companies, but not hearing much from Kraft Heinz. Thank you.
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Pablo. This is Bernardo. Let me address the first part of your question. Then I'm going to ask David to comment. On the portfolio, while I can say that we, as we have been saying, we're happy with existing portfolio. I think each brand and category does play a role. For sure, they're in the different stage of their life and the categories have different performance, as expected. But in general terms, we're happy with that.
Also true that after 2.5 years of integration, our understanding of each one of the category is much different. What allows us to measure the returns of each one of them and their perspective looking five, 10 years in a much better way than we would say that a year and a half ago, right. So we do look each category and each transaction in a different way. But in general I would say we're happy with our portfolio. David, do you want to complement the question, please?

David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thanks, Bernardo, and thanks for the question, Pablo. This is David. So in terms of balance sheet, what I'd say is again and I said before, we continue to be very focused on delevering. We are fully committed to investment-grade status. That is non-negotiable for us. That is top priority for us from a capital policy perspective. So I think I just want to reiterate that point.
Second, on the year, we may not get all the way to our intended run rate in 2018. That's largely going to be in part due to the fact that we prefunded our post-retirement medical and part of our pension at the end of last year. But bottom line, we're very happy with where the balance sheet is. We believe our credit's very strong and getting better. We've significantly de-risked the balance sheet. We expect significant cash benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that I talked about last quarter, and we expect considerably better post-integration free cash flow as well. So again, we feel very good about the balance sheet and are committed to our investment grade status.
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Pablo. This is Paulo. On the coffee question, I think you will see that we're going to be launching  you're going to see new products in our coffee category and segment in liquid in cold brew, in ready-to-drink under Max brand, the Maxwell House brand. And also you're going to be see a lot of more investments behind the brands in the second half.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula of UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC
Hi. A quick question for David. Just wanted to get a feel for the phasing of the reinvestment spend. Was first quarter the largest bulk of that to drop, or should we expect 2Q to be a little bit bigger than 1Q? That's my first question. Thanks.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Steven. Thanks for the question. This is David. So in terms of the investment profile, I'd say from a P&L perspective, should be pretty consistent through the year. So I wouldn't expect a lot of volatility there. I think it's important to kind of talk a little bit about where we're investing again, which we talked about on the last call. So first, we're investing in go-to-market and that's both in the U.S. in-store sales that Paulo talked a little bit about earlier. We're investing in e-commerce like Bernardo mentioned, as well as distribution expansion in some of our key international markets like China and Latin America. And these types of investments will largely be through our SG&A line.
Second, we're investing heavily in service, and that's primarily in North America, but we're also investing in Europe as well. And this type of investment will largely flow through our cost of goods sold line. And then finally, we're investing in working media dollars, which we plan to drive in 2018 and will also be more concentrated in our SG&A line.
Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then second question is for Bernardo. Just wanted to get a sense of your level of confidence in the back half revenue acceleration this year versus the prior year. In 2017, you seemed pretty confident that a lot of the summer plans were really going to come to fruition. Sales trended a bit below that. So what gives you I guess the added degree of confidence this year relative to last year? Thank you.
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Steven. I think it's a fair question. Well, I think a lot's what David already highlighted before, right, the trend that we're seeing here, David and Paulo, are pretty much related to contracted or able to regain on the nuts territory. We'll be behind the constraint we have in capacity on the potato territory. Our innovation is coming really strong as we speak, right. And even with all the inflation pressure described by David, the actions which we put in place on the cost side, especially on the procurement and manufacturing side, they are very weighted towards the second half of the year.

So when I look about sales and EBITDA, for sure we need to execute, but all the drivers of the joint business plans with the main clients in United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, in Latin America are in place. The main trend that we are seeing in the top categories where we're still suffering decline are in place and the innovation is coming to market. So by all means, we are seeing consumption to continue to get better in most parts of the countries we operate.
So there is a lot for us to do like we have our analogy. We know still there are headwinds against us coming in Q2, but we are confident that the actions we're taking today and the investments we're putting in place will start to payout in the second half of the year carrying this momentum going into 2019.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your question please.
Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi.
Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.
If we could just take one more question, that would be great. Thanks.
Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right. Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Just two quick ones for me. First, Bernardo, I'd like to get your perspective on valuations. And I guess more specifically we've seen the equity markets reduce the valuations for consumer staple stocks, yet we've seen transactions within the industry sort of not come down as well given the transaction multiples. So if you can give a perspective on just kind of what you're thinking about the transaction market, just how multiples have fared. And is that at all affected your appetite at least in the near term in terms of maybe where the ask is versus what you'd be looking to bid?
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Well, thanks, Bryan. Look, as a matter of practice, we don't like to comment on rumors and speculations on our peer's transaction, right. I think what we can say, again, that our framework for M&A has not changed like I highlighted before, and we are disciplined in the sense of seeing prices and return and long-term shareholder value. Because, remember, the way we operate and invest as owners there is a very long-term perspective, right. We're definitely not traders in that sense. We look those things that we can own and create value from a longer-term job. So in that sense, we do believe that valuations are definitely more attractive today, even if you think about relative valuations. If the price is right, we believe we can move when we do find a situation that two plus two is more than four.
Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
As a follow-up, does size matter? Like I think there's a perception that the only type of properties you're looking at would be large transformational, but is that necessarily true? Do you look at small bolt-on and sort of large transformational simultaneously?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Bryan. This is David. So, look, I think our number one goal, as Bernardo said, is to generate shareholder value over the long term. So we'll look at any opportunity that comes our way, but we're not going to speak to any sort of hypotheticals, but again that's our number one goal, and we'll look across a number of different potential opportunities.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018. More than 2.2 billion people now use Facebook every month, and more than 1.4 billion people use it every day. Our business grew 49% year-over-year to $12 billion. But as you know, we have important issues to address.
For most of our existence, we've focused on all the good that connecting people can bring. But it's clear now we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well, whether that's foreign interference in elections, fake news, hate speech, or app developers and data privacy. So now, we're going through every part of our relationship with people and making sure we're taking a broad enough view of our responsibility, not just to build tools, but to make sure those tools are used for good. This means continuing to invest heavily in safety, security and privacy.
Some of this will come in the form of new technology. We're restricting that data developers can access. We're building advanced AI tools that have helped us detect and remove tens of thousands of fake accounts ahead of the elections in France, Germany and Alabama last year. We're investing more in people. We are doubling our team working on security and content review to more than 20,000 people by the end of this year, and this includes content reviewers with specific language skills to detect hate speech in places like Myanmar. We're also working to protect political discourse by making ads more transparent.

We recently announced that from now on we will require everyone running political and issue ads or running a large page to be verified with a government ID. And we're also starting to roll out ads transparency tools that bring our ads to an even higher standard of transparency than TV or print ads. You'll be able to see who is running a political ad, who they're targeting, how much they're paying, and what other messages they're sending to different people. And we're going to get this done in time for the 2018 U.S. midterm as well as upcoming elections in Mexico, Brazil, India, Pakistan and more.
We have a responsibility to keep our community safe and secure, and we're going to invest heavily to do that. At the same time, we also have a responsibility to keep moving forward and keep building tools that bring people together in meaningful new ways. That's what makes Facebook so important to so many people and that's our responsibility too.
I'm proud that more than 2 billion people use our services to stay connected with the people that matter to them most. In just the last several months, we've seen the #metoo movement and the March for Our Lives, organized, at least in part, on Facebook. We've seen people come together after Hurricane Harvey to raise more than $20 million for relief, and we've seen more than 80 million small businesses use Facebook to grow and create jobs.
That's why beyond the investments we're making to secure our platform, we're going to invest even more in building the experiences that bring people together on Facebook in the first place. Over the next three years, we're going to keep building Facebook to not only be a service that people love to use, but also one that's good for people and good for society.
Last quarter, we shared our well-being research into the good and bad uses of technology that showed that when you use the internet to interact and build relationships that's correlated with greater long-term well-being and greater health and happiness over time. But when you're just passively watching videos or news online, that's not as positive.
This quarter, we've continued shifting from passive consumption to encouraging meaningful interaction. It's still early, but we're starting to see some signs that this is working. Some types of sharing are increasing even as passive consumption of video is down. And at the same time, we're rolling out more interactive video features like Watch Party that let you watch video with your friend. This is something we can uniquely do and the feedback on it so far is great.
Groups is also a major focus for us. This quarter, we announced that 200 million people are now members of meaningful groups on Facebook. Now we just need to keep doubling that for the next few years to reach our goal of helping 1 billion people belong to meaningful groups. As membership in physical groups continues declining as it has for decades, we hope helping people connect online will help strengthen our society's social fabric.
Stories is also a big part of the future of video sharing, which is why we're all in on it across our family. Instagram was the first to really take off here, Facebook started slower, but is now growing quickly, too, and WhatsApp Status is by far the biggest of views products and continues to grow quickly. There's also a clear trend towards sharing with smaller groups, which is why messaging is so important. Between WhatsApp and Messenger, people now send almost 100 billion messages every day. They also do more than 3 billion minutes of video and voice calling every day, making us by far the largest network for video calling as well.
Over the next five years, we're focused on building out the business ecosystems around our apps like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. This quarter, we released WhatsApp Business, which lets small businesses create a presence and offers better tools for messaging. And in just a few months more than 3 million people are actively using WhatsApp Business. It's a hit and it's growing quickly.

One of the interesting opportunities and challenges over the coming years will be making sure that ads are as good in Stories as they are in feeds. If we don't do this well, then as more sharing shifts to Stories, that could hurt our business. But there's real upside here, too, if we do a good job. And we're leading the way here with Instagram, and the results so far are promising both on product quality and business performance.
Over the next 10 years, we're continuing to work on the long-term technology that we need to break down barriers and bring the world closer together. We continue to work on connectivity and our Internet.org efforts have now helped almost 100 million people get access to the Internet who may not have had it otherwise.
AI is the most important technological trend right now and I'm optimistic that it can help us amplify the good that's happening on our services as well as proactively remove harmful content. For example, one thing that I'm proud of is our AI tools that help us take down ISIS and Al Qaeda related terror content, with 99% of that content being removed before any person flags it to us.
We've also built AI tools that have flagged when people are posting thoughts about suicide. And these tools have helped us reach out to first responders to get over 1,000 people the help they need quickly.
On the positive side, AI will help us understand the context of what people are sharing so we can help encourage more connection and conversations between people as well.
And finally, we have some big moments for virtual reality coming up, and I'm excited to get Oculus Go in people's hands soon.
Overall, 2018 is a year of important investment to keep people safe and also to keep building the experiences people expect from us. We are taking a broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our tools are used for good.
And we also need to keep moving forward, building new tools to help people connect, build community and bring the world closer together. Thanks to all of you for being a part of this journey. I'm looking forward to making more progress together.
Now, here's Sheryl to talk about our business.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Hi, everyone. Before going through our results, I want to take a minute to talk about ads and privacy. At Facebook, we have always built privacy protections into our ad system. We use the information you provide and that we receive from websites to target ads for advertisers, but we don't tell them who you are. We don't sell your information to advertisers or anyone else.
We also believe that people should control their advertising experience. For every ad we show, there's an option to find out why you're seeing that ad and to turn off ads from that advertiser entirely. And you can opt out of being targeted based on certain information, like the websites you visit or your relationship status.
Advertising and protecting people's information are not at odds. We do both. Targeted ads that respect people's privacy are better ads. They show people things that they're more likely to be interested in. We regularly hear from people who use Facebook that they prefer to see ads that are relevant to them and their lives.
Effective advertising is also critical to helping businesses grow. This is especially important for small businesses who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford to buy broad reach media. As Mark shared, we now have more than 80 million small businesses around the world using Facebook pages and many of them are building their businesses on Facebook.
Small businesses are the backbone of local communities and create the majority of jobs around the world and their growth creates millions of new jobs. We surveyed small businesses in 18 countries, and more than half of SMBs on Facebook say they've been able to hire more people due to growth in demand since joining our platform.

Last month, I was in Houston for Facebook's Community Boost event. I met Patrice Farooq, who runs a small business called Cupcake Kitchen. After Hurricane Harvey damaged her business last year, she used Facebook to find new customers. Now more than half her business come from Facebook and she's getting ready to open a second store.
We're proud of the ad model we've built. It ensures that people see more useful ads, allows millions of businesses to grow and enables us to provide a global service that's free for all to use. The fastest way to bridge the digital divide in the United States or around the world is by offering services free to any consumer regardless of their circumstance. Advertising supported businesses like Facebook equalize access and improve opportunity.
At the same time, we know that people want control over how their information is used, and we want them to feel confident that the ads they're seeing are authentic. That's why we're building industry-leading transparency tools. This includes a way to see ads an advertiser is running, even if they aren't targeted to you. This new feature is live in Canada and will roll out in Ireland and the U.S. soon.
In the coming months, GDPR will give us another opportunity to make sure people fully understand how their information is used by our services. It's an EU regulation, but as Mark said a few weeks ago, we're going to extend these controls to everyone who uses Facebook regardless of where in the world they live. Our commitment to you is that we will continue to improve our ads model by strengthening privacy and choice, while giving businesses of all sizes new and better tools to help them grow.
With that, I'd like to turn to our results. It was a great quarter for our business. Q1 ad revenue grew 50% year-over-year. Mobile ad revenue was $10.7 billion, up 60% from last year and contributed approximately 91% of total ad revenue. Revenue growth was broad-based across regions, marketer segments and verticals.
We continue to make progress on our three priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing new ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, leveraging the power of mobile. Advertisers recognize the importance of reaching their audience on mobile. During the Super Bowl this year, over 90% of national TV advertisers were also advertising on Facebook. This shows that the largest advertisers understand the value of broad-based campaigns with us.
Take Tourism Australia. To get more Americans interested in visiting Australia, they ran ads on Facebook and Instagram in the week leading up to the game. On Super Bowl Sunday, they ran short video ads on Facebook before their big TV spot at halftime. This drove 22% incremental reach on top of TV and a 35 point lift in awareness. During the campaign, 50% of leads on the Tourism Australia site came from Facebook.
Second, developing new ad products. Instagram Stories is changing how people share and express themselves. Advertisers are also finding creative ways to use the format. This quarter, we made carousel ads available in Stories so advertisers can share up to three images or videos per ad instead of just one. People can swipe up on the ads to visit the advertiser's website.
We also announced a number of innovations to help retailers reach customers. We rolled out a more personalized shopping experience in News Feed. Now when people click on a collection ad, they'll see a full-screen catalog organized according to their interests.
We also introduced a new way to reach people before they've shown interest in making a specific purchase. If someone is generally interested in furniture, a business can now run ads focused on different categories of their products, such as couches or tables, to inspire them to shop.

And last, making our ads more relevant and effective. Our investments in measurement are helping advertisers of all sizes understand their results and make good investment decisions.
We've heard from many of our advertisers that they want third-party verification to prove that we're helping them achieve their marketing goals. We were recently accredited by the Media Ratings Council for News Feed served ad impressions on desktop and mobile. We're working with them on accreditation in other areas as well.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on these three priorities and ensure that people's privacy is protected on Facebook.
I want to close by thanking our teams around the world for the work they do each and every day and each and every quarter to make our company and our services better. I'm also truly grateful to our partners who work with us to grow their businesses.
Thanks, and now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Our community and business both showed solid growth in the first quarter. Let's start with our community metrics. Daily active users on Facebook reached 1.45 billion, up 13% compared to last year, led by user growth in India, Indonesia and Vietnam. This number represents approximately 66% of our 2.2 billion monthly active users in Q1. MAUs were up 260 million or 13% compared to last year.
Turning now to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $12 billion, up 49% or 42% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange tailwinds contributed $536 million of revenue in Q1. Additionally, the adoption of ASC 606, the new revenue standard, resulted in approximately $130 million of incremental revenue in Q1 due to a change from net to gross accounting for our Instant Articles product.
Q1 total ad revenue was $11.8 billion, up 50% or 43% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $10.7 billion, up 60%. In Q1, the average price per ad increased 39%, and the number of ad impressions served increased 8%, driven primarily by feed ads on Facebook and Instagram. Payments and other fees revenue was $171 million, down 2%.
Turning to expenses, total expenses were $6.5 billion, up 39%. In Q1, we added over 2,600 employees, which was a record level of net new hires. We ended Q1 with over 27,700 full-time employees, up 48% compared to last year. We are focused on growing technical head count as well as a variety of other groups that support the business.
Operating income was $5.4 billion, representing a 46% operating margin. Our effective tax rate was 11%. Net income was $5 billion or $1.69 per share. Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. In Q1, we generated $5 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with approximately $44 billion in cash and investments.
In Q1, we bought back approximately $1.9 billion of our Class A common stock. Given our existing repurchase program is nearly fully executed, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $9 billion of stock.
Turning to our outlook, the changes that Mark and Sheryl described will, we believe, benefit our community and our business and will serve to strengthen Facebook overall. At the highest level, we believe that we can continue to build the great ads business while protecting people's privacy. That said, with regard to GDPR and other initiatives around data usage, while it's early and difficult to know the business implications in advance, we anticipate a couple of impacts.
First, as you might expect, we believe that European MAU and DAU may be flat to slightly down sequentially in Q2 as a result of the GDPR rollout. Second, while we do not anticipate these changes will significantly impact advertising revenue, there is certainly the potential for some impact and we will be monitoring this closely.

Importantly, GDPR affects the entire online advertising industry, so the Facebook specific impact is difficult to model in advance. In terms of our overall 2018 revenue outlook, we continue to anticipate revenue growth rates will decelerate on a constant currency basis throughout the year.
On the expense side, we are tightening our initial expense guidance range. We now expect that full year 2018 total expenses will grow 50% to 60% compared to our prior range of 45% to 60%. This narrowed range reflects the significant investments we're making in areas like safety and security, content acquisition and our long-term innovation efforts.
Turning to capital expenditures, we expect that our full year 2018 capital expenditures will be around $15 billion, at the high end of our prior range of $14 billion to $15 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. We also expect continued growth in capital expenditures beyond 2018 to support global growth and ongoing product improvements.
Turning now to tax, at current stock prices, we expect that our Q2 and full year 2018 tax rate will be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, fluctuations in our stock price will impact our tax rate.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the growth in our business and global community remains strong. We have a lot of work ahead and are investing aggressively to enhance safety, security and privacy, while also focusing on our mission of giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. One for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, so you focused on bringing people together and clearly have this massive platform with strong engagement, but can you talk about some of the business opportunities for Facebook on the platform away from advertising, and where you're most focused there?
And then Dave, just on the OpEx, can you talk about kind of more specifically where some of the incremental costs would fall that take the previous low end of the range here off the table, given what you've seen over the last couple months? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I could take the first question. So we think that ads is a great business model that is aligned with our mission. We want to build a service that can help connect everyone around the world, so we want to offer that service for free and have it be affordable, and that's completely aligned with what we're trying to do.
So even when we do other things, like we're running tests of payments, we have Marketplace which is growing and doing well, there may be other ways that we could think about making money from those, but in general our strategy is to offer those services at cost and make it so that businesses can bid what it is worth to them to run ads in the system. We think that that is both the most efficient way to run the business, it offers every business in the world the lowest prices that we can potentially offer, and it provides a great free service to people around the world.
I know that a lot of people have had questions about the business model, and this is something that I just think we at Facebook are very proud of. And we think that it is the right way to build a service that connects everyone around the world.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Hey, Doug. It's Dave. So if you recall, it's very consistent with what we've been talking about the last couple of quarters which is the acceleration of expense growth is really driven by three factors. So it's the investments that we're making in safety and security, it's the content investments we're making to support Watch, and then finally it's the innovation initiatives around our longer term bets like AI, AR, VR and connectivity.

So it's those three factors. If I had to point to what's really leading us to tighten the range, it's really the first factor which is the safety and security investments. Specifically, we're putting more behind that more quickly than we anticipated, and so that's where you're going to see it come up.
If you look at the current results from this quarter, you'll see that our sales and marketing expense grew 51% in the quarter  one of the  year-over-year. One of the factors driving that is that's where we're categorizing our community operations investment and other operations teams that support the quality initiatives and the safety initiatives. So you're already seeing some of that getting picked up in the quarter and you'll see that carry through in the year.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
Mark A. May - Citi Investment Research
Thank you. This question's probably aimed at Dave. You commented that you do not expect any significant, maybe some impact from the implementation of GDPR, yet you also voiced some uncertainty there. I guess the question is what gives you confidence in coming out now and saying that you expect no significant impact on the ad business, maybe some?
And then maybe more for Mark, there have been some recent reports that imply that even some seemingly simple things that Facebook may not be proactively identifying or addressing have come up and I guess the question is, is it that it's not as simple as it may seem, or is it that these reports aren't accurate, this just has to do with some of the sensitive data like social security information being showing up online? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Hey, Mark. It's Dave. So on GDPR, I think fundamentally we believe we can continue to build a great ads business while protecting the privacy of the people who use Facebook. As part of the rollout of GDPR, we're providing a lot of control to people around their ad settings and we're committed, as Sheryl and Mark mentioned, to providing those same controls worldwide.
And while we don't expect these changes will significantly impact advertising revenue, there's certainly potential for some impact. Any change of the ability for us and our advertisers to use data can impact our optimization potential at the margin, which could impact our ability to drive price improvements in the long run. So we'll just have to watch how that plays out over time.
I think it's important to note that GDPR is affecting the entire online advertising industry. And so what's really most important in winning budgets is our relative performance versus other opportunities presented to marketers. And that's why it will be important to watch kind of how this plays out at the industry level.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On the social security information, social security is not an input people put into Facebook and posts containing information like social security numbers or credit cards are not allowed on our site and we remove them as soon as we become aware of it. So we're continually working to improve these efforts and we encourage our community to report anything like this that they see, but that's not data that Facebook is collecting in any way.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question, maybe two if I can. Mark, in the changes you talked about at the product level at the beginning part of the year, as you've started to make those changes and some of the content people see on the platform has evolved, what does that mean for engagement? What are you seeing in terms of the way people are using Facebook? I know it's early days, but curious if you've seen anything in terms of change of behavior.

And then, Sheryl, we're starting to pick up from advertisers a lot of momentum and positive commentary on messaging platforms, especially Facebook Messenger. Wanted to know if you'd give us any color about your own conversations on the business side, on the messaging apps, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and how investors should think about the opportunity there. Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I can speak to the first point. So we made a number of changes and are still making changes to prioritize meaningful interactions between people over passive consumption of content. And that follows a lot of feedback directly from our community that people want Facebook to be more about friends and family and less about just content consumption. And it also follows the well-being research that we've done that suggests that when people use the Internet for interacting with people and building relationships, that is correlated with all of the positive measures of well-being that you just expect like longer term health and happiness, feeling more connected and less lonely, whereas just passively consuming content is not necessarily positive on those dimensions.
So we've been rolling out a number of changes, both product changes and ranking the News Feed. As I said in my opening remarks, that has increased or we've observed increases in some types of sharing and interaction between people based on that. We've also observed some continued declines as we've done this and in the passive consumption of video, specifically.
Overall, I'd say that these changes are doing what we expected that they would do and helping people to connect more and have more meaningful interactions. I think that that's the thing that people can uniquely do on Facebook that they can't do on other services that may be more about just consuming content.
So we think that this is going in the direction of building a stronger community and a stronger business over the long term, and we're optimistic about what we're seeing here.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On Messenger, we continue to be primarily focused on consumer growth and engagement, and we're being slow and deliberate with monetization. It's worth noting this isn't a feed product, so there are some more unknowns here.
But I think the potential is real and big and growing. We see a lot of organic connections between businesses and consumers, and our experience is that where are those  where we have those organic connections, that's very promising to turn that into monetization as well.
We have over 18 million businesses now communicating with their customers through Messenger. We have 2 billion messages sent between people and businesses a month, which includes automated messages.
And we're focused on launching new tools that help businesses use Messenger. For this quarter, we launched new quick replies for customers. We're seeing ads in inbox, which are now available to all advertisers.
It's really early, but nice pick up and nice buzz there. And click to Messenger ads on Facebook are actually very promising as well because advertisers want to see a return for the money they spend. And when they have an ad and they can get a direct contact one to one with a customer, that's been something that people are really excited about. So early days, but I think a lot of potential here.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Thank you. I'd like to follow-up a little bit on usage just because of the comments last quarter. Any update to the time spent trends on Facebook post your changes?
I guess, a second question is, do you think time spent on Facebook can start to grow again?

And then third, when you look holistically at Instagram, which seems to be doing really well in third-party services, how do you think about the whole platform in total, Facebook plus Instagram? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah, so I'll take that. In terms of time spent on Facebook, we're not providing a specific update on that. I would note that Mark talked about some of the changes we're making to focus on connections over consumption. So we're seeing a decrease in certain types of time spent such as passive video consumption as a result of that and an increase in areas like sharing. So, we're not really optimizing the business on time spent, but rather the kind of quality of conversations and connections.
So we're continuing to invest in that work, and we think it's the right thing for the Facebook community in the long run. And I think it's also good for overall engagement.
For Instagram, that continues to perform very well, not providing kind of a separate breakout of that, but Instagram continues to grow nicely, both as a  both from an engagement perspective and a business perspective.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could talk a little about Watch. I know it's early, but I was wondering if you could share with us your initial thoughts on how it's going versus your expectations? How you see it evolving over the next couple years? And ultimately, how would you define success for it as you look out? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So for Watch, the big thing that we're trying to do is help create new ways that people can connect, right? So it's very different from video and News Feed, the passive consumption that I'm talking about on response to some of the other questions because it's intentional, right? I mean, people go to it to watch specific content.
And we're trying to make a different experience than what you might be able to get on YouTube or any of these other services by making it more about connecting with people in different ways.
So a good example of this is what I talked about with Watch Party, where now people  groups of people can get together and can watch videos at the same time and you can interact around that. And we think that that's the kind of experience that we can uniquely build and that that's going to further our mission and just be a unique thing that we can add to the world.
So what we're seeing so far is that a bunch of the content that has come onto Watch is good and is working and people watch it. We're continuing to treat the product to emphasize that kind of content more while building more of these social features.
I'd say it's still pretty early overall in terms of the growth of this, but it's clearly an area that's important where I think we have something unique that we're going to bring to make this successful.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Just two questions. Dave, is the impression growth acceleration to 8% a function of easier comps or is it a function of some of the changes that Mark was talking about around the News Feed content that you put in in January?
And then is the North America ad revenue growth acceleration being driven by that, that change on core Facebook? Or is it more coming from Instagram? Any color there on those two accelerating trends would be great.
And then the last one is just a follow-up on the GDPR topic. Dave, you mentioned that MAUs and DAUs might be down a little bit in 2Q in Europe. Is that what you've seen already from these new screens that just came out with the new terms of service? Or is that just a guess of what you might see in the future? Thank you.

David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So I think I'll take all of those, Ross. So the impression growth acceleration, you've got a couple factors going on there. One of the factors is just that the desktop roll-off is just continuing. So as it gets smaller, it has less of a depressive effect on the overall impression growth number, because if you recall, desktop has quite a number of impressions per DAU, just given it's the right-hand column that has multiple impressions on each screen. So that's one of the reasons. And obviously, Instagram is continuing to grow nicely as well, so that's another contributing factor there.
In terms of the North America revenue growth acceleration, one of the big factors there is really just also that's where you're picking up some of the accounting change from the Instant Articles going from net to gross, so that's contributing to that acceleration. Obviously, I'm very pleased with the strength of North American ad revenue and, overall, all the different regions, but that's a factor there, and IG is, obviously, contributing nicely to growth in North America and worldwide.
Finally, on the GDPR trend, that's just based on what we're expecting given that you're having to bring people through these consent flows, and we have been modeling it and expect there would be a flat to down impact on MAU and DAU. It's very early in our rollout, but nothing inconsistent with what we've been modeling. So that's why we're giving that indication of what we expect.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two; one for Dave and one for Mark. Dave, will the privacy policy or the opt-in process differ in Europe versus other geographies post GDPR? Your prepared remarks suggested that those controls would extend to the rest of the world. And if that is the case, why wouldn't we also potentially see an impact to MAU and/or DAU outside of just Europe? And then Mark, just simple question, having watched most of your testimony on Capitol Hill, I just wonder what did you learn, or what surprised you the most personally from that experience? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Do you want to take that, Sheryl?
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. On the GDPR changes, so we just started rolling out the GDPR controls in Europe and we're going to make all the same controls and settings available every way, which gives people the same opportunities to make the same choices. It's not going to be exactly the same format. It's going to be localized instead for different parts of the world. And so we think some of the differences will come from that.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
And on the testimony, these are important issues and I think that that was an important moment to be able to go and hear what people were wondering about and just to have a public hearing of answering all of the questions around Cambridge Analytica and what we knew and all the steps that we're taking on data privacy and developers to make sure that this doesn't happen again and to lay out all the different things that we're doing.
I mean, the hearings didn't just touch on that. They also touched on a number of the other issues that we face, including foreign interference in elections and that's something that we're incredibly focused on. 2018 is going to be an incredibly important year on this. There are big elections, not just the U.S. midterms, but the major elections upcoming in Mexico, in Brazil, in India, and Pakistan, and a number of other countries around the world. So this is important and it was an important moment for the company to hear the feedback and to show what we're doing. And now I think the important thing is that we execute on all the things that we need to do to make sure that we keep people safe.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak, your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Two questions. First, you posted another strong quarter for ad growth. Just wondering given the recent events, has there been any change in kind of advertisers' views about the platform, or concerns about ROI going forward? And then second on video, was there much investment in video content in the first quarter, or do you expect the bulk of the video content spend to hit kind of through the rest of the year, and what types of content will you be investing in?
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
To the first, in the immediate days of the concern, we heard from a handful of advertisers who paused spend, one of whom has already come back, and we haven't seen a meaningful trend or anything much since then. Advertisers ask the same questions as people are, that they want to make sure their and their customers' data is protected, and I think we are able to answer those questions in a compelling way.
In terms of ROI on the platform, the ROI is really determined by the ability of advertisers to put the right ad in front of the right person in the right format. And I think we're seeing impressive growth in all of those areas. We have more advertisers using the ability to target their ads to the right person. We have more advertisers experimenting with different formats. Stories on Instagram are a very promising one, and we're seeing some nice experimentation there.
And we have more advertisers really embracing the measurement that helps close the loop and helps make their ads more effective. So I think in terms of the ROI we are able to offer our marketers, the signs are strong, and we also continue to see there's a lot of room for improvement.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah, John, on the video investment in the first quarter, it's clearly going to be more weighted towards the rest of the year, but we're already seeing the impact of some of that. So if you look at just the cost of revenue line where that's getting picked up, we saw cost of revenue grow 66% year-over-year. If you look at the gross margin, it dropped from 86% to 84%.
There's really two kind main  two big factors in that compression there. One of those is the video content investment. The other is the move to gross versus net accounting on the Instant Articles product. So those are the two things that I'd point to as being drivers of that margin compression getting picked up in cost of revenue. So video is having an impact, but we grew expenses 39% year-over-year in the first quarter. We're obviously expecting faster growth in the back half  back three quarters of the year, so that's  video's going to be a component in driving that.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. A couple for Sheryl, if I may. A couple on GDPR. Do you think it's going to have any impact on your measurement capabilities? So that's one. And then secondly, if users elect to take the strictest possible approach to their data management, would their product experience change in any way on Facebook? I mean, we have a sense that their advertising experience might change, but in terms of their use of News Feed or any of your products, would the actual product functionality materially change for them? Thanks very much.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
When you think about the way people have the choice to restrict data use, I think it would affect the product. There is lots of ways we use data to make the product better. It really depends what that would be. I don't think we have full visibility into what those changes would be over the long time.

In terms of measurement capabilities, I don't think there's a direct thing we're exactly worried about right now. It's more what happens over the long time. The way we think about it, and Dave said this, is that the amount of uncertainty there is for us and all the other companies in the digital advertising industry is reasonably higher than it's been right now because we're in the process of rolling out GDPR.
We're going to all know a lot more after we roll out, but the thing that won't change is that advertisers are going to look at the highest ROI opportunity. And what's most important in winning budgets is relative performance in the industry. And so we think that certainly we want to provide the best advertising, we certainly want to provide the best measurement, but our ability to do so as long as things happen across the industry, which is what's happening, I think we remain in a very strong position.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question. Sorry. Technological challenges. There's been a lot of good questions around core Facebook. Can you talk a little bit about Instagram, Mark, and how do you see the product evolving over the next 12 months? What are your visions for how it could continue to drive more engagement and maybe even higher quality connections on Instagram? And then second one on payments. Could you talk a little about philosophically how you think about the importance of enabling more frictionless payments to drive a higher quality advertising experience on Messenger and WhatsApp?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So, on Instagram, there are a number of really exciting opportunities. The main focus is on helping people capture and share any moment that they want, and also the whole theme that we have around community plays out a little bit differently on Instagram. So for example, while there is no formal groups product on Instagram, people use Explore. More than 200 million people use Explore in order to see content that's interesting to them and interact with people beyond their friends and the people who are  who they follow directly.
We launched hashtag following in December. That's a product that has done very well. I think now more than 100 million people follow different hashtags, which is a way that people can form ad hoc communities, and that  it all goes towards the overall mission that we have as a company of helping to build community and bring people closer together. Private sharing, both with Stories and direct messaging, are growing incredibly quickly on Instagram, and I think that those are both very exciting areas for development of products as well.
You asked about payments in WhatsApp and Messenger, was that right?
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So I think that this is going to be a really big opportunity. And again, like I said earlier, the point here isn't to charge for payments. It's that messaging can be a more transactional medium than feed. So I think what you're going to start to see are people interacting with pages, maybe follow a page on Facebook or Instagram. You see content from that page. You can click through or tap through to a message thread, and then you can either get customer support or complete a transaction or do a follow-on transaction. And that will be very valuable for businesses.
So we view the payment in that context not as the goal, but as something that's helping the business and the person succeed at having the transaction or doing what they're trying to do. And that's going to make people's experience better, somebody can just do that online, and it's going to make businesses  it's going to make the experience of being on Facebook as a business more valuable because you can complete the transactions there.

I'll add one more thing that I think is interesting on payments. I think this is probably different from what you're asking about, but I think it's cool. We've been running an experiment with mobile financial services in Messenger, and one of the things that we found in the Philippines, for example, is that people can buy access to data plans through Messenger.
And because it allows the mobile carriers to not have to have the whole supply chain and sales and retail that they have otherwise, they're able to sell the data plans for on average about 10% less than they would be able to otherwise, which actually is allowing more people to get on the internet in the first place because they can now afford data plans.
So it's an interesting example of how having payments in messaging can increase efficiency for businesses and how in this case that's contributing to our Internet.org and connectivity goals of helping more people access the internet who wouldn't have otherwise been able to. In other cases, it will be able to help people accomplish their goals with different businesses more easily.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks, and good afternoon. First off, related to the machine learning capabilities and more specifically how that's deployed into content filtering, I wonder if you can compare the ability of the machines to analyze content today versus six months or even a year ago? Meaning, is that ability improving at a rate where you have a higher degree of confidence in that reliability?
And then secondly, wonder if you've been able to discern any impact to date on content publishers or apps that are utilizing Facebook for reach and engagement following the rollout of changes in access to APIs, login and other developer resources. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I could take the first one. So on AI, I think that there's a very big shift in how we're going to think about content moderation on the platform.
And I mean, this goes back to the beginning of the service, right? So in 2004, when I was starting in my dorm room, for a number of reasons, it was just me, so we didn't have a lot of capacity to have thousands of people reviewing content. AI technology was not developed at the time.
The only real logical way to run the service was to enable people to share what they wanted and then reactively, if people in the community saw something that was offensive or they thought was against the rules, they'd flag it for us. And we'd look at it and take things down that didn't belong.
Now it is becoming increasingly possible, both because we can build the AI tools, but couple that with being able to hire thousands and thousands of people to do faster review of the content and look at something proactively. We're shifting over the next few years to a much more proactive model of moderation.
Now, one of the things that I think is going to be interesting, and in some cases a little frustrating, is that AI tools lend themselves towards identifying certain content a lot more easily than others.
So one area where I'm very proud that we're doing great work is around identifying terrorist content. And I mentioned this before that 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda related content that we take down, we're removing before any person flags it to us. And that's great, right? That's doing a good job.
But if you look at areas like hate speech, which are just much more nuanced linguistically, it really depends on the local language, that's an area where I think it's going to take more years to be able to do something reasonably.
So one of the pieces of criticism that I think we get that I think is fair is we're much better able to enforce our nudity policies, for example, than we are hate speech. And the reason for that is it's much easier to build an AI system that can detect a nipple than it is to determine what is linguistically hate speech.

So this is something that I think we will make progress on and will get better on over time. These are not unsolvable problems, although it's worth calling out that our adversaries have all the same AI tools  or some of them, I think. I'd like to think that we're a little bit ahead. But we'll have a lot of the same tools as the field develops.
But the combination of building AI and hiring what is going to be tens of thousands of people to work on these problems, I think will see us make very meaningful progress going forward.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
To your second question, when we think about what's happening with developers, we are doing an audit of large developers and doing some investigation. We don't break out marketer segments, but mobile app install ads, which is where the revenue would come from developers, is a relatively small part of our advertising revenue. And our mobile app install ads help apps of all kinds, not those running on our platform.
So we think the investigatory work we're doing into APIs, into the use, is very important, and we don't expect it to have an impact on revenue.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Two questions, please. David, could you just try to spell out a little bit more how GDPR could actually impact advertising revenue growth in the future, like, what's the doomsday scenario here? Is it just that it's clipped down because there would be a hit maybe near term to MAUs and DAUs? Or is there a reasonable scenario under which tracking or targeting would be impaired? Just spell out what the worst case scenario is. I'm kind of skeptical that there is one. But if there is one, please spell it out.
And then, Mark, on Oculus, could you just give us a little bit of an update on your kind of long-term thinking about Oculus? There hasn't been a lot of focus on it. But Oculus Go is coming out. So maybe we all should take another  have another thought on it, like the opportunity you see there, where you think the product development is at this point? Are we years away from something mass marketable? Any commentary like that would be really helpful. Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
So, Mark, on the first question, I don't know that we really see a doomsday scenario here. I think what we think is that depending on how people react to the controls and the ad settings, there could be some limitations to data usage. We believe that those will be relatively minor. But depending on how broadly the controls are adopted and set, there is a potential to impact targeting for our advertisers.
Obviously, if they are less able to target effectively, they'll get a lower ROI on their advertising campaigns. They'll then bid differently into the auction. That ultimately will flow through into how we can realize price on the impressions that we're selling.
So I think that's the mitigating issue that we could see, depending on how GDPR and our broader commitment to providing these same controls worldwide could play out.
We think that there is a great case for not just our business, but also for the user experience on Facebook to have targeting because we think it's a better experience for the people who use Facebook to have targeted ads. We think we can do that in a privacy-protected way, and it's just a better experience. You get more relevant ads. And I think overall benefits not only the advertisers, but also the people who use Facebook.
So I don't think we see a real doomsday scenario here. We see an opportunity to really make the case.

Your next question...
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
And on virtual reality...
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.

Mark has a second part of that question.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So on virtual reality here, I think the big picture is that every 10 to 15 years or so there is a major new computing paradigm, right, whether that's DOS and then Windows and kind of desktop UI and then web browsers and now mobile phones and apps. So it strikes me as inevitable that that progression will continue. And each one gets to be more natural to interact with, more natural gestures for controlling, more immersive, more portable.
So I think it strikes me as very likely that the next one is going to be around virtual and augmented reality. So we're investing a lot in this because, frankly, we haven't to date been a hardware company or an operating system company. And we think that we need to build up a lot of different muscles in order to be competitive and be able to succeed in that space and to be able to shape that space.
One of my great regrets in how we've run the company so far is I feel like we didn't get to shape the way that mobile platforms developed as much as would be good because they were developed contemporaneously with Facebook early on, right. I mean, iOS and Android came out around 2007. We were really small company at that point. So that just wasn't a thing that we were working on.
But now I think we're living in a world where  the way that I think about this is that people should really be at the center of how we design technology. It shouldn't be designed around apps. It should be designed around our relationships because that's what matters to people. And that's not the world we're on on mobile. So I really am very committed to this idea of making sure that the next platform reflects those values that Facebook stands for.
I think this is going to be an exciting year. As you mentioned, Oculus Go is coming out. We have the prototype and the developer kit around the higher-end stand-alone coming out as well, and we're doing a number of other things that I think are going to be quite exciting over time as well. But that's how I think about the whole space.
I don't know exactly when it's going to be a big deal. When we started talking about this, I said that I thought that this was going to be a 10-year journey before this was really a very mainstream, major platform. And I think the reality is Facebook needs to be investing before it is a big thing in order to build some of the muscles to be competitive. We're committed to doing that because I think that this is important for our mission.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When you think about the opportunities for the business broadly, you obviously are crushing it from an advertising standpoint when you look at any measure of growth. But wondering as you think about how you take this massive platform of users and engagement that you have across all your platforms, I'm thinking about if you look at like what Spotify has been able to achieve in music subscriptions, what Apple even has done in music subscriptions, what Netflix is doing in video, Amazon obviously now crossing 100 million subscribers. Like, is there other lines of business, other revenue streams that people should be thinking about that create substantial opportunities, and specifically subscription, and then maybe if you could just touch on from a commerce standpoint now that Instagram's starting to be such a big driver of commerce, how do you think about diversifying revenues versus essentially being almost pure advertising? Thanks so much.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
We've certainly thought about lots of other forms of monetization, including subscriptions, and we'll always continue to consider everything. Ads for us is a very natural fit for our business, and we have a lot of runway ahead of us. We've done  obviously, we have 80 million now pages, so we have 80 million businesses using Facebook on a monthly basis, of which 6 million are advertisers. On Instagram, we have 25 million Instagram business profiles, of which 2 million are advertisers. So even if we just convert people who are advertising on Facebook into Instagram, that's a lot of a growth opportunity. Then you can start thinking about Messenger and some of the other platforms we have.

What's I think interesting and strong about our potential business growth is that we're able to do this across these services. So as I mentioned before, running an ad that has a click to Messenger ad that goes into Messenger is just an early example of what's possible. And I think if you look at a large base of businesses who use us without paying, the growing base of businesses who do pay us and then the runway we have in services that are 1 billion plus (59:48) that we're really not monetizing, I think a strong focus on ads continues to be the best investment we can make. It's also very core to our mission. Ads gives us the ability to provide a free service to the world. And if your goal is to connect to everyone and make sure that people can all participate, that ads-based model makes a lot of sense and we're going to continue to invest very heavily there.

The last question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust.
Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you very much. I guess two quick questions for David. Growth in MAUs in rest of world was up about 11%; I think last year, it was up almost double that, 19% or so. Anything changed there that maybe could explain the slowdown? And I think we saw also a slighter  slightly lower growth in pricing as well. And then lastly, on the buyback, how much do you still have left on the old authorization to which we need to add the new $9 billion? And how do you look at it? Is it being (01:00:54) opportunistic, or do you have a timeline by which you guys are planning to complete the repurchase? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, Youssef. On the growth in MAUs in rest of world, we've had certain slowdowns. There was an internet shutdown in Ethiopia that contributed a little bit to that. So you've got some kind of one-time factors that do come into play there. So I think that's probably what I would point to. Nothing that notable to call out there.
In terms of the share repurchase authorization, I would just say that we've just about gotten our way through that. We had about $2 billion left as of the end of the quarter. But we think it's  we asked the board and the board approved a $9 billion additional authorization. We look at it on two fronts: just offsetting the dilution from the share issuances that we have and then secondarily, to be opportunistic. And we think with the cash flow that we're generating, we have a strong financial position with which to fund that.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip Technology first quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition actives and share-based compensation. Net sales in the June quarter were a record $972.1 million, above the high end of our June 5, 2017, upwardly revised guidance and up 7.7% sequentially from net sales of $902.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted the summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.4% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 22.9% of sales, below the low end of our guidance range of 23%. And non-GAAP operating income was a record 37.5%, well above the high end of the our guidance of 37%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $319.1 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $1.31, which was $0.07 higher than the mid-point of our guidance of $1.24, up 12.9% on a sequential basis and up 56% as compared to the same quarter last year.
On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 60.1% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.4 million of share-based compensation and $0.7 million benefit from the recovery of material that was previously written off due to a vendor material issue.

Total operating expenses were $362.8 million and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $120.8 million, share-based compensation of $19 million, $2.9 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special income of $2.8 million, consisting primarily of the gain on the sale of the Micrel San Jose wafer fab in the June quarter. After these adjustments, GAAP net income was a record $170.6 million or $0.70 per diluted share.
The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.7% in the June quarter. The GAAP tax rate was negative 2.6% in the quarter. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8.25% and 9.25%. The large difference between our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates relates to the differences in the specific tax rates that apply to the charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at June 30, 2017 was $426.8 million. Microchip had 100 days of inventory at June 30, down three days from the end of the March quarter. Inventory days are at a seven year low and we don't expect inventory days to grow in the current quarter as our capacity increases are hardly keeping pace with the increases in demand we are seeing in the business. Inventory at our distributors was at 31 days and that was down two days from the March quarter levels.
The cash flow from operating activities was a record at $345 million in the June quarter. As of June 30 the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.65 billion, of which about $546 million is domestic cash.
We continued to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ending the June quarter at 1.58. This is down from 1.94 at the end of the March quarter. Our EBITDA in the June quarter was a record $395.6 million. We expect our net debt-to-EBITDA to be under 1.3 by the end of September. Our net debt-to-EBITDA does not include our 2037 convertible debt as it is excluded from our banking covenants because it is more equity-like in nature due to its 20 year maturity date. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is in excellent condition and declining rapidly, so we're not going to continue to share this metrics in our earnings calls in future periods unless there is a material change.
During the June quarter, we received about $40 million of capital at our facilities. Capital spending for the quarter was only $22.1 million due to the timing of the receipt of the equipment and when it was paid for. We expect about $70 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $180 million.
We are aggressively adding capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business over time, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $29 million.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the businesses in the June quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased with how all our product lines performed in the June quarter and how the combined assets of Microchip and former Atmel working in harmony continue to produce differential growth results. These are our first results since we unveiled Microchip 2.0 to our investors about two months ago. We look forward to sharing many more updates of our transformation to Microchip 2.0 as we continue to enable our clients with the very best smart, connected and secure embedded applications.

Let's now take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business performed very strongly in the June quarter with revenue being up 9.5% sequentially as compared to the March quarter, setting a new record in the process. On a year-over-year basis, the June quarter microcontroller revenue was up a whopping 18.1%. The June quarter of this year and the year-ago June quarter are completely comparable, as they both represent a full quarter of combined Microchip and Atmel business.
We continue to see clients using microcontrollers that originated from Atmel's heritage express confidence in Microchip's stewardship of these product families. As a result, we are seeing more designs that are in the pipeline, going to production and ramping in volume. We're also seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel, which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.
Microcontrollers had over $2.5 billion in annualized revenue, representing 65.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. Additionally, we shipped our 20 billionth cumulative microcontroller in the June quarter. In the June quarter, we also started sampling the PIC32 C product line, our first PIC32 microcontroller, which happened to have an ARM core, so we now have PIC32 microcontrollers with MIPS and ARM cores within them, both of which are supported by the Microchip development tools ecosystem. This is consistent with what we have always said, which is that the core inside the microcontroller is not as important as the brand on the outside, along with the attendant brand promise for what clients expect from PIC microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller business gained further market share in the second quarter of calendar 2017, as evidenced by our June quarter results. In fact, the results show that all our microcontroller product lines are firing on all cylinders and driving differential growth and market share gains. We believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we advance the Microchip 2.0 transformation and build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Moving now to our analog business, our analog product revenue was up 3.7% sequentially in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter and also set a new record in the process. Our analog results were negatively impacted by capacity constraints on products with Atmel heritage, without which the growth would have been higher. On a year-over-year basis, the June quarter analog revenue was up 11.2%, well ahead of the market growth rate for analog. At over $950 million in annualized revenue, our analog products represented 24.6% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter.
We are successfully finding more opportunities to attach microcontroller's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers and microprocessors at multiple customers and applications. This effort should pay dividends over time as these new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog products, as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion annualized revenue business for Microchip sometime in fiscal year 2018 and a much larger business in the coming years.
Moving now to our licensing business. Our licensing business was up 8.5% sequentially in the June quarter and set a new record in the process as annualized revenue broke through the $100 million mark for the first time ever. For the last three to four years, we have licensed multiple foundries and independent device markers on multiple process technology nodes and have been working to enable getting these technologies qualified for production. We expect the fruits of this work will soon begin to manifest in our licensing results as the licensed processes start generating royalty revenue for many, many years to come.

Moving to our memory business. This business was sequentially up 8.8% in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. We have been very successful in our memory business using the combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel and getting the best from each. There are significant cost reductions underway using Atmel-originated silicon, which will be assembled and tested using Microchip's back-end factories to achieve the lowest overall cost. We believe that this effort will make us even more competitive and improve gross margins further. We continue to run our memory product line in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions.
Finally, before I conclude, a couple of general items. First, in case there are any lingering concerns about the automotive end market in light of the results announced by some of our competitors and the seasonally adjusted annualized rate of automobile shipments, also known as SAAR, which some analysts track, we would like to categorically state that our automotive business performance was strong in the June quarter, with sequential growth pretty close to the Microchip's overall performance.
Now this is understandable as Microchip content tends to be in mid to high end cars, which are less sensitive to inventory and consumer cycles, and we continue to benefit from the growth in automobile electronics as well as our market share gains in the automotive market segment. Therefore Microchip's automotive business does not necessarily track with the SAAR numbers, and we expect our automotive business to perform well again in the September quarter.
For more information about our automotive business, we refer you to a presentation we made on June 6 at an automotive-focused investor conference, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Secondly, on the heels of our ranking in April by Semicast as one of the top 10 largest automotive semiconductor companies, IHS in June ranked Microchip as one of the top 10 largest industrial semiconductor companies and among the top three largest micro-component suppliers to the industrial market. Micro-components in the IHS report refer to microcontrollers and microprocessors. Automotive and industrial are important end markets for our growth and consistent performance, and as we shared with you in May, they together represent about 60% of our revenue.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon everyone. Well, how do you like the results from Microchip 2.0? Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2018. I will also provide update on capacity enhancement activities, as well as Microchip 2.0 that we introduced to the investors during the last quarter.
Our June quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our net sales were a huge new record and well above the high end of our revised guidance. Our non-GAAP net sales for this quarter were up 15.2% from the June quarter of a year ago and this revenue comparison is not impacted by any acquisition since Atmel's full quarter revenue was in the June 2016 quarter.
Our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share each exceeded the high end of our guidance and each crossed significant milestones. Our non-GAAP gross margin crossed the important 60% milestone, non-GAAP operating profit exceeded 37% for the first time and non-GAAP earnings per share crossed an important run rate of well over $5 per share annualized.

Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 56% from the June quarter of a year ago due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and successful execution of our core business as well as accretion from our acquisitions. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 107th consecutive profitable quarter.
There are three other points I would like to make on our sales growth. First, every one of our major product lines, 8-bit MCU, 16-bit MCU, 32-bit MCU, analog, wireless, licensing, memory and others were up significantly in the June 2017 quarter over the year ago quarter. Number two, every major geography, North America, Europe and Asia, were up significantly in the June 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter. And number three, sales in all end markets were up in the June 2017 quarter over the year-ago quarter.
Regarding the reason for the large sequential and year-over-year growth, I will refer you back to Microchip 2.0. We are experiencing an enormous customer preference to design with our microcontroller solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit customer applications. This is also demonstrated in the recent EE Times survey. The EE Times survey also indicates that customers believe that Microchip has the best ecosystem in the industry.
On the top of that, our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line through which we are able to provide total system solutions to our customers. Our sales channels have been trained and are welcoming the opportunity to sell multiple products to our customers in the same board. As a result our customers are responding by giving us incremental design wins with multiple products in the same board. We have an enormous design win funnel and we feel very optimistic that in Microchip 2.0 we will continue to see the acceleration in the organic growth of Microchip.
Now, before I go into the guidance for our September quarter, I will say that we are continuing to see a very strong business environment for our products worldwide and have a number of company-specific demand drivers. Our bookings rate in the June quarter was extremely strong. Our inventories at Microchip as well as at the distributors are towards the low end of the normal range. Both inventories at Microchip as well as distributors declined further sequentially in the June quarter. While our manufacturing operations produced a lot more units in the June quarter, we shipped them all for growth and did not progress towards improving our inventory position.
However, through the growth of capacity and producing a lot more units, our lead times have stabilized. While lead times are still longer than what we would like them to be, they're not getting any longer and we appear to have created a soft landing so far without triggering any double ordering or panic from our customer base.
We have increased wafer starts in our three internal fabs and we're adding capacity in our three back-end facilities. We will continue to add additional capacity in all of our fabs, assembly test plants, foundries and sub-contractors. In the back end, there are too many product tester/handler combinations. We are catching up on some of those combinations, as we convert Atmel products to Microchip's more efficient assembly test platforms. However, we don't expect to fully catch up on all product tester/handler combinations until the middle of calendar year 2018.
Now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We expect total net sales to be up approximately 3% sequentially, which represents approximately 14.6% on a year-over-year basis. I want to remind investors that in the last five years, we had three acquisitions that closed in the September quarter: SMSC closed in August of fiscal year 2013; ISSC closed in July of fiscal year 2015 and Micrel closed in August of fiscal year 2016. Therefore, mathematically taking the average of the last five years of sequential growth will give you a number of 6.7% and that number would be totally wrong.

Excluding these acquisitions, the average sequential growth in the September quarter over the past five years, has been just under 0.5% and ranged between minus 2.6% and plus 6.5%. Our current sequential revenue guidance of 3% growth and year-over-year guidance of 14.6% growth is showing substantial organic growth, consistent with the Microchip 2.0 that we have presented to investors. As a result, in September quarter, we expect to see our first $1 billion quarter.
Regarding gross margin, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company. We expect gross margin for the September quarter to be between 60.5% to 60.75% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 22.5% and 23% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 37.5% and 38.25% of sales, and we expect earnings per share to be between $1.33 and $1.37 per share.
In our last quarter, we revised up our long-term financial model to a long-term non-GAAP gross margin of 62.5%, operating expense of 22.5% and operating profit of 40% and as you have seen, we are relentlessly marching towards this model. This quarter we would like to share with investors our longer-term annual growth expectations of high single digit growth. This higher growth expectation comes from our transformation to Microchip 2.0 and an environment which we expect through industry consolidation will continue to improve from a pricing discipline standpoint.
Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provides more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Yes. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and outlook. Steve, you mentioned pricing discipline as being an important factor. When I look at the two other microcontroller companies that are bigger than Microchip, Renesas, and NXP, do you see this pricing discipline pervasive in the industry? Or I assume you really mostly talk about Microchip, but what about your competitors, do you see this pervasive through the industry?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
The pricing discipline is improving and to a different extent with various manufacturers. I can't mention it, the names of the competitors and specifically what they are doing, but we have seen some discipline on others also, some more than the others. Microchip has kind of led this charge in the last five years, and especially after the acquisition of Atmel, whose pricing was really below acceptable pricing, we have quite substantially corrected those pricing and we have seen others who were relatively undisciplined also make some correct moves in that direction.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I see. And so my follow up, you have mentioned a few times the concept of attaching more analog products. Is there a way to quantify what that attach rate is, how it's trended and whether it's even useful to analyze this trend?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well it's not something we can completely externally share, but we have large number of internal indicators, which are really driven by number of Microchip products per customer board. So if you think about years ago, we just sold microcontrollers and you will usually have one device per customer board. We have well in excess of one device per customer board and the larger and larger that number becomes means you are being able to attach more and more devices, and rather than the attach, we kind of use the word these days, total system solutions. So we track that internally and it's moving in the positive direction. It's not something we plan to share with the Street as just one other thing to track and hit us over the head with.

Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
We also have some examples in some of the investor conference presentations and again if you go back to Steve's presentation from back in early June, you'll see some examples of what exactly total system solution means.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
And those slides are still on the Internet. You can check it in the investor page.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thanks, Vivek.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yes. Congratulations on the record quarter and thanks very much for taking the question. The question was on the lead times. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more quantification of how extended lead times have gotten to and just any sort of differences between different types of products and if you can put into context versus prior cycles.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So our lead times on most products today are between, I would say, 4 weeks and 20 weeks. So lots and lots of products are kind of normal on lead time. It could be version of a given silicon that is longer, but other versions are shorter, so a large bracket around it is about 4 weeks to 20 weeks. But more important part is really, they're not getting any longer. They were getting longer in the prior quarters, as we extended and the normal lead times we will consider where 90% of our products can be bought in 4 to 8 weeks.
So that's kind of the bracket and with the capacity growth we have had, we have been able to stabilize the lead time, but as I said in my remarks, we're essentially shipping all the excess production for growth and not able to either lower the amount of delinquent product, or unsupported product, nor are we able to really dramatically shorten the lead times. On some products with tester/handler product combinations have caught up, yes, but in broad majority, lead times are stable but not coming in yet.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
That's helpful. And for a follow-up question, somewhat related to that, in your prepared remarkets, Steve, you commented that you think by stabilizing lead times, you think you can engineer a soft landing. You've always been very thoughtful on the cycle and in revenue growth. Any more detail either for the industry or Microchip specifically about what's baked into that assumption about a soft landing and how exactly you go from sort of mid-teens growth to what's assumed in a soft landing scenario? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, I don't have any comments on the industry. I resigned from that job two years ago. We're just simply  I will comment on Microchip. And what I'm seeing is that by lead times really not going longer and taking almost a year to bring these lead times down, that we're guiding to really by the middle of next year, we believe we already have engineered a soft landing and not creating any panic, not having runaway book-to-bill ratio, strong backlog, fair amount of unsupported product. But still largely good behavior on the part of customers and distributors. Inventory is still very low all over the board. Our distributor inventories are low. Our Microchip inventories are lowest in seven years. This is essentially engineering a soft landing.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thank you.
Operator
And we'll now take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, I had a couple sort of clarifying questions around your longer-term growth rate of high single digits. Is that your view on an organic basis or will that continue to include sort of the successful M&A strategy you've employed in the past? And if it's more the former than the latter, does that change your view on M&A? In addition, you talked about better pricing. I'd just be kind of curious from where we were to where you think we're going, how much pricing adds to that.

And then my last point would just be market share, and I guess around that specifically the time when some of your peers are kind of consolidating their distribution partners and trying to take economics from them, you're taking sort of a more of a Switzerland approach and kind of spreading the wealth a little bit. Do you think that's having a positive effect just through the distribution channel, and that enormous design funnel you were talking about? Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Those were a number of questions. Let me see if I can remember all of them.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
First one was organic growth is our, what you talked about -
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So the high single digit kind of growth I talked about is organic. The acquisitions are unpredictable. You do not know when they happen. You cannot schedule them. So that growth rate is organic. Now we believe over the last several years as the industry growth has been fairly slow, with the exception of this current year where the industry growth has been reasonable, there was always unit growth, but the entire unit growth was eaten up by the year-over-year price decreases and pricing pressures and bad practices in our industry constantly to give the price away. As through consolidation and other reasons as large companies have got in pricing discipline, we believe that unit growth is not being eaten up by the price drop. So some of that price discipline is built in into the longer-term organic growth guidance we're giving. And the second part was?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
The second question he asked was does the change in your view on organic growth change the M&A strategy.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Does it change the M&A strategy, it does not change the M&A strategy. If we find a right company that fits well, we can buy it at a reasonable price, is accretive going in and with all the other  check all of the boxes that we have, sort of a pretty proprietary scheme of how we essentially select an acquisition, if we can do that we will do it. However, as you know, the herd is thinning. There are fewer companies left and the valuations are quite high as we speak. But as we're able to find some things on reasonable valuation, it doesn't change our view.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
All right, and John, I think the last piece of your question was market share. I'd like you to repeat that question to make sure we answer it specifically.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah, to the extent  how much of the high single digit long-term growth is expected market share gains and specifically at a time when some of your peers are sort of consolidating their distribution partners and trying to take back some economics from their distribution partners, you seem to be taking more of a Switzerland approach and perhaps spreading the wealth a little bit more. And I'm just kind of curious as to what extent you think that's really helping that design funnel you referenced your prepared comments?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, these distribution things go in cycles. You made a call 10 years ago, we were taking some actions on distribution when we felt that certain distributors were not creating demand, and a decade later now some other people feel the same way. So these things kind of go in cycles.
But what we're experiencing is currently, as a number of our competitors have defranchised either distributor completely or they have narrowed their margins and not giving them demand creation margin, we have seen these distributors put a tremendous attention and focus on Microchip and especially with a broadened product line sort of under the Microchip 2.0 initiative that we have, we are finding that distributors are finding the new Microchip 2.0 product portfolio to be so much more desirable and essentially being able to replace the number of other competitive companies where they have lost a franchise on, including microcontroller, analog, wireless, USB, Ethernet, wired products, USB, Ethernet and wireless, just really timing is just perfect for the distribution to grab onto our broad portfolio, and do a great job for us. So I think we are taking advantage of it right now.

John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
And then Steve, if I could sneak one more in, clearly your initial intent around the Atmel acquisition was to buy back stock, and you ended up not doing that. The stock's had a good absolute run since then, but if you kind of look at the relative valuation of Microchip to the S&P, I think by our math this is one of the lowest levels we've seen in almost 15 years. And so can you talk a little bit about the appetite to do some buybacks here, and whether or not, given where you are on your net leverage and your ability to generate cash flow, that that might become a more systematic way of returning cash to shareholders?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, the net leverage isn't a problem now. We're down to 1.58 and we'll be lower again by the end of September. That's not the issue. I think the issue is the majority of the cash is still overseas and we've got about $0.5 billion or so here domestically, and we're still looking for the next acquisition. So it really wouldn't make sense to buy a bunch of stock back and then either have to issue stock in the next acquisition or really then borrow large amounts of money. So I don't think buying back stock really fits right now.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Perfect. Thanks and congratulations again, guys.
Operator
And we'll now take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the very strong results and outlook. Steve, I know you're out of the sort of broader semi cycle discussion, but as it relates to your business, you've got very good year-over-year growth that you just posted. The guidance suggest it moderates slightly sequentially. Let's say you beat that a little bit; you're still growing very solid double digits year-over-year. What do you anticipate with your new high single digits long-term growth view, how do you anticipate sort of the back part of this cycle to look like? At what pace do you expect that growth that's very strong right now to moderate?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I don't really have a whole lot to say on that in terms of cycle. I think we are seeing a very, very strong demand for our products. I think it's largely driven by a lot of company-specific drivers in analog, in attach, in being able to take Atmel portfolio that was being marketed in a substandard way. Costs were high. Other things were not right and we're correcting a lot of those things and being able to attach analog, wireless and other products to that portfolio.
So a lot of it is really company-specific drivers and so I think really this growth momentum continues. We didn't want it to get over frothy and get into double ordering and holding and all that. I believe we're successfully avoiding that by engineering a soft landing. So somewhere over the next year, I think it goes from the current growth rate to the long-term growth rate almost in a soft landing fashion.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
That's helpful. One other question, it's actually a product question. I normally don't spend a lot of time in this area, especially in your press releases, but you highlighted in the first bullet regarding highlights from the quarter a new product with a 2D GPU integrated. I wonder, is that representative of any new trend as it relates to AI inference on the edge, perhaps. Are you seeing more demand for that sort of processing capability and if you could talk about the market for that sort of product, it would be very helpful. Thank you.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So, I'll have Ganesh comment on that, but let me read the bullet for all the investors. It says Microchip announced the industry's first microcontroller with integrated 2D GPU and integrated DDR2 memory. Our PIC32MZ DA family provides ground-breaking capabilities for an MCU. Ganesh?

Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So, yeah, this is not really related to artificial intelligence. This is in embedded applications, there is a set of applications where people want the richness of the human interface to include graphics that have more capability. Those have historically been done with separate processors that did the microcontroller or microprocessor and the graphics on a separate chip. We are now putting those together, creating more complete solutions where the microcontroller, the graphics and the DRAM that's required are all on the same chip and in the same package. So, it's an extension of continuing to have high performance microcontrollers, opening up new embedded control spaces.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And we'll now take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yes. Thank you. Good evening, guys. I guess the first question just a follow-on on the steps you're taking with regard to the soft landing. And I think we understand what you're saying there. Perhaps you could talk about what's different in the steps that you are taking now, as compared to some prior cycles when your lead times extended. Is it now that you've moved more quickly to expand some capacity and prevent the lead times from getting higher? And maybe if could just expand upon that.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I think the main difference is, your memory is probably of the event two or three years ago. Was it 2014 I think, there was basically a abrupt contraction in the Chinese business at that time, which we mentioned in our call, and that's really what led to a quarterly miss and then cycle unraveling, and it was seen by the entire industry subsequently within three, four months of that, even though a lot of the investors and analysts originally did not see it. We saw it first. I can't predict the world events. There's a war somewhere, something else happens and some sort of event to terminate or to change it. So I think that was the main difference. If your outlook is that some sort of strong event takes place somewhere, then all bets change, that I cannot forecast.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Right. Okay. I don't have a crystal ball for that either. Just with the follow-on, on gross margins, perhaps you could talk about some of the specific benefits over the next few quarters. I know that you're still working to consolidate some of the manufacturing. There's still some steps that will benefit gross margins aside from just better fixed cost absorption.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So, we're ramping all six of our facilities. Three are front end wafer fabs and our three back-end facilities, investing significant capital and those investments increase the utilization in the facilities, make us more cost effective, make the cost per unit go lower. And so, there's a lot of things happening across the board. There's a lot happening in back-end manufacturing which we've talked about more extensively where the lot of the capital dollars are going. And as those come to fruition, the gross margin is going to improve. This last quarter, we continued to see benefits from the Micrel shutdown and most of that is in the model at this point in time, but there's still a little bit of that to go. But the main things are really the capacity improvements pricing as Steve has talked about publically, continues to be a driver of gross margin and we think that's going to continue as better practices happen throughout the industry.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.

Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking the question, and I'll throw my hat in the ring on the congratulations on good execution. And I'll just start on that point and go back to two points that you made, Steve, one the target for high single digit long-term growth and the view that that's attainable, and secondly, that with Microchip 2.0, organic sales should accelerate. You've recently presented I think it's seven points on revenue growth related to Microchip 2.0. So with an eye towards monitoring the leverage that are really going to drive that growth acceleration, what are the things that us investors should be focused on as we monitor Microchip's progress to drive accelerating growth under those seven initiatives?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Are you picking up seven initiatives from our conference call presentation?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC
That was from your presentation of Microchip 2.0 I believe. I think you had seven different revenue growth drivers there.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Just pulling it up. I think your question is really sort of how can investors track it. So, a lot of it is related to being able to sell a large number of peripheral products around the main microcontroller, which you sometime call it attach and we're calling it total system solution. We are seeing it in our funnel. We are seeing it in number of design wins of devices per board going up from one, like one would be no attach. So a lot of these things we don't plan to share it externally, I think. So that's part of the challenge.
But total system solution we will track it internally. You can track customer preference to design with our MCUs. That analysts and investors can track. There's an EE Times survey which is public. It's on their website. When asked the customers which microcontroller do you expect to use for your next embedded design on 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 8 and 16, we were number one. And 32-bit, if you combine ours and Atmel and two or three different lines, we're number one tied again over there too. So that you can track.
We have multiple growth drivers as we quarter-after-quarter talk to you about growth of our microcontroller business, growth of licensing business, growth of analog business. We don't break out our wireless business, wired and wired connectivity. A lot of that is embedded into the analog business. We have tremendous growth going on in our security business as people in IoT are looking for security for transactions, security of being able to connect to the device. We have number of key assets in that area. Automotive business is doing very well in networking, in HMI, in access control, lighting, body electronics. You can see some of that through our press release, continuous flow of press release we are having with most of us and other. So, I think it's complex tracking, but it's all there.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC
All right. Thanks for the color on that. The follow-up question will be for Eric and it's just related to inventory. So seven year lows on hand. The channel is lean. Is that a level that Microchip can comfortably operate at if we think about the intermediate term or should we expect in what would typically be a seasonally softer period like the fiscal third quarter that the company would look to replenish some inventory whether it's in the channel on hand or both.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So channel inventory, we can't really manage other than the fact of delivering the product that the distributors want. So that's a little bit tougher, but it is on the low end of what we've seen historically. Our own inventory, we've been trying to build inventory on the balance sheet for the last three quarters and just haven't been able to do so with the upsides in demand that we've experienced. So this quarter we expect to not build inventory again. The lead time commentary that Steve talked about getting healthy by the middle of calendar 2018, I think that's probably at the point when inventories might return to a more normalized level. But it's very hard to predict what the demand environment is going to be.

Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So you talked about a seasonally softer December quarter in which we could build some inventory. I think what's more likely is that we are able to catch up on some of the delinquencies and unsupported product leading to better than seasonal December, but not building inventories, because you can't build inventory before you have given the product to the customer to meet their demand. So it's more likely that we will reduce the unsupported amount of product than building inventory. So that's what it looks like right now.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. So from what you can see now, the demand from your customers, as well as the timing with which new capacity is coming online, both front end and back end, would lead you to believe that it's likely that there'll be some demand catch-up and you could have an above seasonal December quarter, Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Not really numerically guiding it, but directionally I expect it better than seasonal December.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks for the help. Good luck.

And we'll now take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the solid execution and outlook. On the strong quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year performance in MCUs, I'm just wondering if the Atmel products grew faster than the overall MCU segment. Just post closure, you had higher confidence levels by Atmel's customers. You've got their refreshed 8-bit AVR product line and other enhancements. It's only been more than a year post Atmel. You guys are probably still seeing some of that momentum. Just wondering if this is driving some enhanced growth in the product line.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So we're not commenting on any breakout of growth on Atmel products versus our growth. In some cases, a product can even be substituted and like we said from the very beginning, we manage it as one company and give the customer the best solution, where we have product available or can meet its needs, in some cases, switch from one to other. If the product is not available in one category, make it available in the other category. So I think individually commenting on where the growth is coming from is really not meaningful at this point in time.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Then on the transformation to Microchip 2.0 and then the results of the EE Times survey, I mean the team has already had a strong systems focus in place for a long period of time. I think you guys have something like over 2,500 reference platforms, development boards, sample projects, et cetera. So you guys already had a pretty strong program in place to help customers with their design solutions and drive attach rates. So how does Microchip 2.0 build upon this to further drive the attach rates of analog, connectivity, networking, memory and interface products?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So that's a good question, and let me take a shot at answering it. So Microchip 2.0 is not an event where I flipped a switch today. Microchip 2.0 has been in formation for about five years, and which you yourself said in when we acquired SMSC, we got USB technology, we got Ethernet technology, we got audio technology. When we bought Micrel, we got a number of great analog assets. When we bought Atmel, we got some Wi-Fi assets, we got some security assets and Atmel's large microcontroller portfolio. As you go to the customers, there was largely one product per board. Atmel sold the microcontroller. There was no Microchip analog or anything else present around it, because we were the enemies, so it will be anybody else's product but Microchip's.

And in the last year, on all the internal reference designs, development tools, sales brochures, and sales training and all that, it's now full with Microchip's analog and power management and Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, USB, timing products and all that kinds of stuff. So, this has been a thing in building and we are really just packaging it for you now and saying we are seeing it working, and it took some time to train the apps engineers and sales force and get the distribution aligned with what some other companies have done with their distribution also gave us an opportunity.
So it's really culmination of all these initiatives coming together, where we can tie a board on and say, hey this looks like a new company to our distributors today and to our salespeople and others and saying I can sell a very broad portfolio today. Take any one company out of it, Atmel, it substantially reduces it. Take Micrel out, reduces it further. Take SMSC out, it reduces it further. So it's a build-up on all these companies. I don't know if that helps you.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. That does. Thanks for the insight, Steve.

And we'll now take our next question from Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Steve, I'll ask you to refrain from any industry predictions, but it sounds like the improvement in Microchip is mostly Microchip specific. So, between what you're seeing and what your distis are seeing, how do you think like the overall semi business, sort of the overall semi industry, did during the June quarter? Do you think it just kind of held serve, or do you think there was some improvement sort of industry-wide that happened during the quarter?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, I was hoping that SIA announce their June numbers. Usually they always announced it on July 31. This one time I needed it and they did not, and I was going to use that to comment on it. I think they're going to announce later this week, and that would be a read on the industry. l don't really have any comment on the industry.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then one quick clarification. So on the lead times stretching out, when do you think you could take them back to normal? Do you think it's like a year from now or maybe six months from now, or when do you think we can get back to normal?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So I earlier said, the lead times are right now between four weeks and 20 weeks and are stable, not going longer. The normal we consider between 90% of our products to be within four to eight weeks, and we believe it's going to take us at least till June next year to get there.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got it. Thanks for the clarification.

Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Hello, Gil.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates
Congratulations, again.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates
On your normal inventory levels, you used to have 130 days or 120 days. Do you use these numbers now, or you've changed?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So the normal inventory for us would be 115 to 120 days. We may have in the past also said 115 to 125 days when we felt we needed a larger band. We haven't changed the targets. We just cannot seem to get there with the strength of the demand. I mean the growth we had last quarter of 7.7%, for the last several years that was a two years of growth, that we did it in one quarter. So we're basically, it's taking everything we got in growing the capacity, building more units, and then shipping it out the door for revenue. And the inventories are very low. Our inventory is seven-year low right now, and we don't see short term being able to build it.

Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates
All right. Thank you very much.

And we'll now take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Hello.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thanks for taking my question. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Steve, as you're adding new capacity, do you have an idea of what revenue level can the capacity you've added drive?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, our capacity is being added in small chunks all over the place. You add a furnace here, a handler here, a tester here, a prober here to resolve specific product constraints on specific package types and specific product lines. It's not like we build another $1 billion fab and it takes you from here to there. So the new equipment is arriving every week to two weeks, so it's really more incrementally, serially being added rather than in very, very large chunks to get to some new number. I don't know whether that makes -
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. So this is, yeah, this is a better controlled and avoiding a risk of your customers, I guess, putting in orders that -
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah, there is no capacity, there's no risk here of all this capacity then somehow sits idle. Because as soon as the next tester and handler arrives, there's a rush to put it on the floor, qualify it, characterize it and put it in production. Every diffusion tube, every handler, every (58:36) everything is very quickly going to incrementally produce the product, and help to either, three things, help to either reduce the unsupported product, delinquent product to the customer, that's the first priority. Number two, to then really build a little bit of the inventory so that the lead times will come down. We can never get to the second, because largely, and number three to ship for growth. So shipping for growth is number one, the reducing delinquency is number two and building inventory is number three. We're only able to do number one right now, ship for growth.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. Understood. Thank you.

Caller, please check your mute function. And with no response, we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more to Microchip 2.0 and, Steve, as you said, it's kind of been a formation over five years. But just anything you're doing from a sales organization, from a distribution, whether it's incentivizing them or education to kind of really see the full benefits of 2.0?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So, I happen to have our VP of Sales and Applications, Mitchell Little in the room and I'll give him the unique opportunity to answer that question.
Mitchell R. Little - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you, sir. Our compensation system, first of all, we have to recognize our compensation system has never changed. We are the only non-commission sales team in our industry. So we've not changed any of that, we've done basically the same things. We've engaged with our distribution partnerships in just that mode, engaging with them to help them do more of what they're doing. So we've not shifted anything other than shifting our thinking about total system solutions a little more broadly. We're pretty much what we've always been and been successful at.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then just as a follow-up, Steve any commentary, and I know one of the focuses has been kind of Atmel attach and you touched on that in terms of the opportunities. But any other color you can add in terms of the design kind of funnel and what are you seeing on that front?

Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well like I said, the design win funnel is very, very large. It's almost scary. You never know from a large design-in funnel what is a yield out of that, because customers can always tell you this design is 10 million units, and it turns into a lower amount. We have metrics on that from years of experience what size of the funnel can yield to what kind of growth, so what is the yield out of the funnel.
But with the Microchip 2.0, as some of the input variables are changing, a lot of attach, a lot of ancillary designs around our micro, the whole integration of Atmel, attaching our products to Atmel's microcontroller, I think the yield out of that funnel is a bit less predictable. If the yield is the same as it was before, it's scaringly large, but it's possible that it is a little bit new and therefore the yield could be slightly different. But it's enough good to be very optimistic about what I'm telling you and it's based on data and information. It's not a pipe dream.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

And we'll now take our next question from Chris Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Hey guys. Nice performance on the quarter and also great performance for MCU. Steve, I think you mentioned all those different MCU categories that were up year-on-year. Perhaps you can highlight maybe a few that had upside surprises for you or perhaps some that had faster growth than others.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Ganesh, do you have anything to comment on that?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
No, we don't break out the growth rate of specific microcontroller segments. It works as a collective portfolio. It's very, very strong with a combined portfolio of classic Microchip and Atmel combined. And I think it's winning designs because we've infused energy into the Atmel designs and our historical products have always had strong momentum behind them. But outside of that, we don't have any additional color.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay. Switching gears then. Steve, looking back on publishing that letter to customers in April, what were the effects that you saw immediately after you published that? Did you guys actually see a marked surge or kind of uptick in orders immediately or would you say that it was kind of just select customers coming in and a smaller percentage of customers that put fresh orders in? How would you describe kind of order trends immediately after publish of that? Was it a big deal or not?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So, it was not a big deal. We published the letter on April 4. For some strange reason, investors didn't catch on to it for two weeks. We thought you guys get that in a nanosecond. But we published the letter on the web on April 4. So, I commented on that in our May press release, in the May conference call. We basically did not see any impact. The bookings were extremely strong in the March quarter and after publishing the letter the bookings did not really get any stronger.
The activity that usually takes place is, all of our worldwide sales force takes the letter to our customers and to our distributors and distributors start working with customers to understand their longer-term needs and saying lead times are going longer, so don't only tell me what you need it for this quarter, also tell me what you need for next quarter. Start looking at major products and new designs that may have a substantial ramp coming up, and that information then through distributors and our own people, customer by customer start flowing in into building a demand forecast, and is a more accurate reflection of what we should be building and what we should be planning. And what it results is, and some of it comes into backlog and what it results into is, it increases our ability to build the product in a better mix.

Remember, a large amount of product that we start wafers on, we start wafers on and forecast not always having a backlog today. We start on a forecast and by the time the wafers go through fab, assembly, test, then the backlog will come in on that product to ship it. So, any time you start on a forecast like that, you always have a level of out-of-mix situation where we built a little too much of this, a little too little of that, and the little too much then ships in the following quarter. But it results into some lost sales, because you didn't have the right product. The effect of the letter is really giving us a broader understanding of customers' needs in more exact mix, resulting into an outstanding execution in the correct mix. And its results you saw in the quarter with a very strong growth and continuing strong growth in the coming quarters.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP

I would now like to turn the call over to Silicon Labs' Chief Financial Officer, John Hollister.
John Carter Hollister - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Thanks Jalene. I'm pleased to report strong financial performance in Q1. We entered the year on a strong note with revenue topping the high-end of guidance and ending at $205 million, up 15% year-over-year. Combined with favorable gross margin, we also delivered non-GAAP EPS in excess of our guide at $0.87, up 38% year-on-year.
Our Infrastructure products led the way with an outstanding quarter delivering revenue of $49 million, up over $10 million sequentially, and representing 37% year-on-year growth. This is well above our 10% strategic growth target, and while we anticipated a strong quarter for Infrastructure actual results were meaningfully better than we expected.
Our timing products reached an all-time record with the expansion of clock, oscillator and buffer products in target markets. Our isolation products posted another record revenue quarter with continued strong adoption of digital isolation.
IoT declined as expected, down slightly on consumer seasonality, and based on delayed product ramps on some higher volume emerging customer programs. IoT revenue for the quarter was $103 million, representing a 17% year-on-year increase.
Broadcast declined about 3% year-on-year, but grew slightly to $36 million in Q1 primarily on strength in automotive radio products which set a new record.
And finally, Q1 Access revenue was better than expected, growing slightly sequentially to $17 million, and down about 6% year-on-year.

During Q1, we consolidated our distribution relationships to a single global distributor, Arrow Electronics and expanded our direct sales force. We are maintaining our extensive network of regional distributors and e-tailers to complement our single global distribution partner. We anticipate these changes will create greater efficiencies and contribute to both near and long-term revenue growth.
Distribution revenue for the quarter was $150 million and represented 73% of total sales. No single customer represented more than 5% of total revenue. Geographically, we saw a growth in APAC driven by strong performance in all product areas with declines in the Americas and Europe on IoT and Broadcast consumer.
By end market strength and timing drove increases in communications and broadcast drove increases in automotive. Industrial was stable at just over 50%, and consumer down slightly on seasonality. During the quarter, we successfully implemented ASC 606 requiring revenue recognition based on sell-in rather than sell-through accounting, and we realized an approximate $700,000 increase in revenue as a result. We ended the quarter with a normal amount of inventory in the distribution channel at around 47 days.
Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were robust at 60.6% exceeding expectations primarily due to strength in our Infrastructure products and other product mix effects. As expected, non-GAAP OpEx increased in Q1 to $82 million based on a seasonal peak in payroll taxes and related expenses and also hiring.
Non-GAAP R&D expenses were up $2 million to $44 million, and non-GAAP SG&A expenses were up $4 million to $37 million. We are pleased to report non-GAAP operating margin of 20.9% representing a 360 basis point improvement over Q1 2017, and in line with our target operating model.
Non-GAAP earnings ended above our guidance range at $0.87 per share up 38% year-on-year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was slightly lower than expected at around 11%.
Looking at our Q1 results on a GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.5%. Total GAAP OpEx was $101 million with R&D at $55 million and SG&A at $46 million. GAAP operating margin was 11.5% and GAAP EPS was $0.60 per share.
We realized a significant positive tax benefit, resulting from divesting of stocks at higher values than at the time of grant. We also booked an increase in the fair value of an investment in a closely held company, which added another $1 million to other income. These items contributed to our strong GAAP earnings.
Turning now to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with cash and investments of $766 million. Operating cash flow was $22 million for Q1 coming off of a very strong fiscal 2017, and includes an $18 million payment of payroll taxes related to RSU vesting. Accounts receivable ended at $75 million or 33 days sales outstanding. Net inventory ended the quarter at $77 million, up about $4 million from Q4 and representing inventory turns of 4.2 times. This turns level is slightly below our corporate target of 4.5 and we expect inventory turns to return to target levels later this year.
On April 18th, we closed on the acquisition of Sigma Designs' Z-Wave business. We have successfully on-boarded about 100 new employees who we're very pleased to welcome to Silicon Labs. We funded the $240 million acquisition with cash on hand. Post-deal, we have more than $525 million in available cash and an additional $300 million in incremental borrowing capacity available to us through our credit facility. We continue to have a $100 million share repurchase authorization outstanding for fiscal 2018.
I will now cover guidance for the second quarter which reflects the acquired Z-Wave business as well as an approximate $2 million reduction in revenue related to the ban on U.S. exports to ZTE announced last week.

We expect revenue to be in the range of $211 million to $217 million, with IoT up, Broadcast flat, and Infrastructure and Access down. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately $59.5, and we expect non-GAAP OpEx to be about $86 million.
We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be around 11%, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.87. On a GAAP basis, we expect gross margin to be approximately 58.5%. We expect GAAP OpEx to be around $111 million, and GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.29.
I will now turn the call over to Tyson.
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Thank you, John. We're very pleased to report outstanding first quarter 2018 financial performance, including 15% year-on-year revenue growth driven by strength in Infrastructure and Broadcast automotive. Typically, first quarter revenue is seasonally down, yet we delivered 2% sequential growth and a new all-time record.
We have achieved target operating model performance on revenue growth, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP operating margin for six of the past seven quarters.
We attribute these strong results to continued execution on our strategy focusing on large, sustainable, high-quality growth markets in the Internet of Things, Infrastructure and automotive, which now represent 80% of total Q1 revenue.
Infrastructure powered Q1 results, setting a record with first quarter revenue just shy of $50 million, with records in both timing and isolation. Timing came back strong in Q1 reflecting broad share gains in strategic markets including industrial, data center and wireless and a stable optical networking market.
We're seeing growing diversity in our customer base, beyond core optical networking and a migration to faster data rates. The explosion of data is driving data center upgrades from 10-gig to 100-gig, wireless carrier upgrades from 4G to 5G and service provider upgrades from 100-gig to 400-gig. These higher speeds drive demand for high performance timing products, which plays to our core strength and leadership position in clocks and oscillators.
After launching a multi-year record number of clock and oscillator products in 2017, we continue to expand our timing portfolio to drive revenue growth. Leveraging our expertise in high-performance clock design, in Q1 we introduced a new family of PCI Express clock buffers featuring up to 12 clock outputs. These buffers are ideally suited to provide low-power, low-jitter clock distribution in data center, industrial, communications and consumer designs.
Isolation products represent one of our fastest growing and most diversified product lines. In Q1, we saw strength across a broad range of applications including power supplies, solar, industrial and automotive. We have established ourselves as the leading provider of digital isolation technology to the cloud and telecom markets, where high-speed isolators improve response times and increase efficiency.
We are also the number one supplier of digital isolation technology for electric vehicles, offering best-in-class safety, reliability and noise immunity. Our digital isolation products continue to place additional optocouplers enabling higher performance, reliability and integration for designs requiring protection from high voltages.
Turning to IoT, Silicon Labs is well-positioned to play a leading role in an $8 billion IoT market opportunity, which is expected to grow to about $13 billion over the next five years. We offer leading IoT technology for end-node applications and target market segments including smart home, lighting, metering and industry. To enable a superior customer experience, we deliver easy to use products, platforms and tools to simplify developments, and we have a well-developed channel to get our solutions to market.

Silicon Labs has pioneered in IoT platform to accelerate technology, innovation and product development.

Together, these layers comprise the industry's most flexible, scalable platform for IoT end-node development. Connecting and networking devices and maintaining them through the cloud, adds true economic value, enabling new business models and opportunities for our customers.
In Q1, IoT represented half of our total revenue and achieved 17% first quarter year-on-year growth. Our connectivity portfolio continues to gain traction as we target low power wireless end-nodes with a broad range of protocols which now includes Z-Wave, a leading mesh technology for the smart home market.
Last week we completed the purchase of Sigma Designs' Z-Wave business, our largest and first public acquisition. Z-Wave is a proven, broadly deployed technology having shipped more than 100 million devices into the market to date. The acquisition expands Silicon Labs access to a diverse range of ecosystem partners including Amazon, Alarm.com, ADT, Samsung SmartThings, Yale, Vivint, Google Home, Ring and Comcast. This strategic acquisition complements Silicon Labs comprehensive wireless hardware and software portfolio and strengthens our position in the smart home market.
Z-Wave's focus on product interoperability combined with Silicon Labs' Gecko platform and multiprotocol expertise provides us with a great opportunity to accelerate the Z-Wave road map while enhancing features and capabilities.
Z-Wave's interoperability including forward and backward compatibility has created a strong following of users and installers who enjoy seamless setup and management of devices in the home. Together, Silicon Labs and the Z-Wave Alliance, will continue to advance Z-Wave's technology roadmap delivering innovations which will open the door to millions of potential users of smart home products and drive a unified smart home experience.
In Q1, we introduced the industry's first Wi-Fi products designed specifically for the requirements of IoT applications. Our new Wi-Fi portfolio enables breakthroughs in size, integration, cost and performance, as well as ultra-low power consumption creating new design opportunities for IoT end-nodes that simply weren't possible until now.
Silicon Labs new Wi-Fi transceivers and modules enable half the power consumption of traditional Wi-Fi solutions, while delivering the high-performance, reliability, advanced security and small footprint, which are hallmarks of Silicon Labs innovation.
Our Wi-Fi products are ideal for a wide range of IoT end-node applications, including IP security cameras, point of sale terminals and consumer healthcare devices. Our new Wi-Fi products won VDC Research's Embeddy Award for Best of Show in the hardware category of the 2018 Embedded World Conference. This prestigious award recognizes cutting-edge products from embedded developers.
Broadcast's automotive radio products continued to grow nicely, establishing record revenue in Q1 driven primarily by OEM share gains. Our scalable, high-performance portfolio addresses demanding automotive radio requirements worldwide, while reducing design end cost. We're leveraging core strengths in RF and mixed signals CMOS integration, and in software to enable the building blocks, infrastructure and opportunities to create a more connected world.
Our innovations are propelling growth and will improve lives and transform industries for decades to come. We're excited about our acquisition of Z-Wave and believe we have the right strategy, products and team in place to achieve our growth objectives. Together, we will continue to deliver differentiated solutions to address large, sustainable, high-quality growth markets.

Your first question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good morning, and thanks for taking my question, nice results. Tyson, maybe you saw such outperformance in the Infrastructure segment. I was just kind of curious you said both segments set a record. I was wondering if one was particularly stronger than the other and if you just maybe talk about what contributed to that?
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Thanks for the question, Blayne. We had very strong performance in both isolation and timing. Coming off of a strong year in isolation and we had had a little bit of a pause in the growth on the timing side with some of the challenges we've had in the optical networking market that has been seen across the industry.
The growth in isolation has been quite strong, and so I would say that the growth in isolation was a little faster than timing. But overall with the annual growth of 37% year-on-year in Infrastructure, you know, is very, very strong performance in both areas. In fact the quarter-on-quarter growth in both areas was about the same.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. And then maybe just on the Z-Wave acquisition, if you could just talk about what that acquisition is adding to the June guidance? And then maybe more strategically, if you could just talk about how Z-Wave and ZigBee fit together in the long run?
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yeah. So if you look at the second quarter, the Z-Wave acquisition, it's a partial quarter of revenue. So it's about an $8 million adder to the Q2 revenue. And if we look out into the whole year, we think that Z-Wave will add about $40 million total revenue to the company.
We're able to now integrate Z-Wave into our sales channel and into our portfolio, into our multi-protocol platform and we certainly see that ZigBee has a substantial position in the market and we have a leadership position on the ZigBee side. We also have a very good position on Bluetooth and have been working on these protocols working interoperably with each other. For instance, you can commission a device with Bluetooth via your smartphone and then have that get on to a ZigBee network or a Thread network, and over time we anticipate that multi-protocol capability to be part of an extension and acceleration of the Z-Wave roadmap.
So we're very excited about Z-Wave being another one of the key technologies for the smart home. It really increases our presence there. We're going to be driving the roadmap for Z-Wave, leveraging the alliance and leveraging the relationships with a lot of the operators and customers there to continue to make the smart home easier to use and to drive penetration out into the market.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.

Your next question comes from the line of Cody Acree from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. Tyson, if you could maybe just talk about the expectations for your ramp of the new Wi-Fi products?
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.

Yeah. So we announced the Wi-Fi product at the Embedded World Conference back in February. We have been sampling that to a number of alpha and beta customers here over the last six months or so. We have customers that are in the process of designing those products in. But if you look at the design in time and then how long it takes to get those products into the market, we'll see a modest amount of revenue possibly in the fourth quarter of this year, but it's really a 2019-2020 story.
Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Okay, great. And John, just from your OpEx increase, is this the new baseline? And then what do you expect for the rest of the year?
John Carter Hollister - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yeah, Cody. This is the new baseline. We talked earlier about having a seasonal increase on some of the French costs kicking in in Q1 with then the incremental hiring in the company, filtering in as we move through the course of the year as those French costs roll off. So this is a rational baseline to look at in terms of the organic spend and then we have a partial quarter with the Z-Wave team which is on the order of around $4 million to $5 million on a steady state, that's more like $6 million a quarter of incremental OpEx with the acquisition activity.
Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC
$6 million per quarter. So as we look into the rest of the year, September and December, what are you expecting OpEx?
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
We're just guiding for Q2 right now, but you can see the $86 million would be essentially a new baseline with a bit of an increase from a full quarter of Z-wave on top of that.
Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Okay, very good. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Benchmark. Your line is open.
Gary Mobley - The Benchmark Co. LLC
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the good start to the year. I wanted to delve a little bit deeper into the Sigma Designs acquisition. As you mentioned it was part of a publically-traded company. So there was some visibility on the run rate of that business and, if I'm not mistaken, the Z-Wave business was as high as $15 million a quarter. And you mentioned a $40 million annual run rate. Is that just a simple extrapolation of maybe some near-term softness is that business?
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Hi, Gary. This is Tyson. The $40 million is the revenue that we would achieve for the entire year given that we just completed the acquisition here on the 18th of April. So, we've got a partial year, which is at $40 million. That's a little bit under or right at a $60 million type of run-rate for the year.
Gary Mobley - The Benchmark Co. LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And you mentioned you took on 100 people, that's obviously implying a pretty lean operation, $600,000 revenue per employee. Is it your plan to accelerate investment in Z-Wave to maybe sort of capture a greater mark opportunity or revenue potential?
John Carter Hollister - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yeah, Gary. This is John. We think the team is pretty well formed and they have done an excellent job building their business. We actually don't see a whole lot of OpEx synergy opportunity on this acquisition. Going back to the structure of the transaction, a lot of the heavy-lifting in that area was really completed in the transaction structuring on the front-end of this. So the team is well formed. Of course we have a few (25:50) in the team, but we see that as a fairly stable team in terms of its overall sizing.
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yeah, Gary. I would also say that we've  because we acquired this out of another company, we have  on day one we're integrating them into our systems in terms of our supply chain, in terms of sales, in terms of our BU structure, in HR. And so we're able to leverage the infrastructure of the company and actually the integration has gone quite well.

So if you look at the corporate structure that is fairly well-optimized out the shoot up the gate, but it's also  we have a lot of assets within the company in terms of our portfolio and our software and we're really excited about integrating this technology and this team into our overall broader team. And I think that given our larger sales channel and given the alliance, there is a lot of synergies back and forth, both in terms of cost within our operations chain, in terms of sales but also as we are able to offer a broader portfolio of technologies to companies we think that longer that's going to be a big boost in terms of the growth both for our products that we have before as well as the Z-Wave. So we're really, really excited about this acquisition and what it brings in terms of capabilities and market position to the company.

Your next question comes from the line of Suji Desilva from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Suji Desilva - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Hi, Tyson. Hi, John. Congrats on a strong results here in 2018. On the Infrastructure side you had a very strong quarter. I know you guided it to decline sequentially. Can you talk about whether there is some inventory congestion here from the products and specifically in timing, what percent of that is now non-optical to understand your diversification there?
John Carter Hollister - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Hey, Suji. This is John. Yeah, one of the notable items for second quarter is the ZTE shipment ban. So we have to cease that here near-term. We'll see how long that takes to work itself out. But so that's  that is a factor at work here. And relative to the other portion of your question, I don't have a specific break-out, but we did see greater diversity in our timing business in the first quarter, in industrial applications as well as data center and some wireless, and those factors definitely contributed to the strong results in timing.
Suji Desilva - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Okay. That's helpful, John. Thanks. And then on the automotive side, I know that's a smaller part of the revenues. But what percent have you grown till here? And is there opportunity beyond the Broadcast products additional auto opportunity for you guys?
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yeah. So really the automotive opportunity for us is around infotainment in the broadcast area where we had record revenue in our automotive radio products and that continues to be a key area of strategic high-quality growth for us. The other big opportunity that we have in automotive is really in electric vehicles and things like battery management systems, motor controls, the on-board chargers, you know, a lot of the systems that require isolation technology, so the isolation products and some of our microcontroller products actually fit well into electric vehicles. And so we've had quite good success in that area as well. We ship into a number of the leading electric vehicle platforms both in development as well as what's shipping into the market today.
Suji Desilva - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Okay. Thanks, Tyson.

Your next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC
Yes. Thank you. And congrats on a strong results. On the IoT business, kind of declining in line with consumer seasonality and some delayed product ramps and some of the higher ramps. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about that  elaborate on the product delays and how we should look at the IoT growing into the second quarter?
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yeah. So there's  some amount of the IoT revenue is in the consumer category and you see some natural seasonality there that's offset by ramps and growth. There were a couple of higher volume designs in IoT that pushed out a bit. We still anticipate those to continue to ramp through the year. We also, in the UK Smart Energy area, the metering designs, there is about over 100 million meters being deployed over about five years. And in Q1, we're seeing a transition from an older platform into a newer platform it's called SMETS1 going into SMETS2. We believe that our market share there is intact, we've got the vast majority of this market and our customers are still engaged. But we did see a bit of a slowdown or a pause in shipments in Q1 due to that transition from SMETS1 to SMETS2 in UK Smart Energy.

Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC
That's helpful. And the IoT kind of target of 20% growth annually. How does that now, you know, how is that now factored in with Z-Wave and this slight hiccup in UK metering?
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
We still feel confident in our 20% organic growth target. So on a pro forma basis we believe that we are intact to hit that long-term 20% growth rate. We had a very good result last year where we grew the IoT business 26%. So we're coming off of a strong year. And adding that, the Z-Wave business has been growing at about that 20% rate and we think that the addition of the Z-Wave business we feel comfortable that the combined  that the Z-Wave portion will grow also at that 20% rate. So, factoring in the Z-Wave acquisition, certainly that would boost the growth rate this year, but so from an organic basis as well as Z-Wave coming in, we feel confident that that 20% growth rate is going to continue.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC
And last question on IoT. Now that you've folded Z-Wave and now you're also introducing new low-power Wi-Fi modules and transceivers, when do you think you can give us a kind of an update on the competitive landscape? How your product portfolio, which is fairly comprehensive, across all different layers stacked up against the competition? Thank you.
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yes. So, if you look competitively, we have been building our multi-protocol capability. We have a leading position on ZigBee. We have a solid position with Bluetooth Smart and a very good position on the proprietary sub-gigahertz wireless. Z-Wave was another one of the leading protocols in the smart home. So in terms of the smart home, we're very, very well positioned. And then, adding Wi-Fi that brings in a whole new set of applications for higher data rate applications. And again all of these wireless protocols are focused on IoT end-node devices where we provide essentially the SoC into the end application and have optimized the power consumption for that as well as all the software, the development tools and then getting this designed in to the thousands of applications that are out there around IoT.
This is a platform that we have been developing, we've added additional capabilities through acquisitions over the last six years, and we saw the continuation of that this quarter. I think that there's a lot of the microcontroller companies out there that do have pinpoints, wireless protocols, I mean, companies like Microchip have done a number of acquisitions and have some level of wireless capability. We do not see them a whole lot in the market out there. We have companies like NXP, which have some position in ZigBee. But given the situation with Qualcomm, and some uncertainty there, I think that that's been to our advantage competitively.
You have ST out there a bit with some of the Bluetooth and certainly have Nordic as a leader on the Bluetooth side. But I think that overall we have, I think, the broadest portfolio of wireless capability and wireless protocols in the industry that are highly optimized for the IoT end node applications and we continue to invest strongly in our next-generation platform to drive cost, to drive security, improvements to drive power consumption down and to further optimize that for the end node applications. So we think competitively we're in very, very good shape and it's really a matter of driving the prioritization and focusing on execution to drive the growth.

Excellent. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes. Thank you. Great quarter. Back to Wi-Fi, Tyson, could you elaborate a little bit more on that, are these 802.11 HaLow products? And perhaps you can comment on how far you're willing to push the envelope on the various different 802.11 standards?

George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
So, if you look at the Wi-Fi standard, the predominantly deployed technology today is 802.11 and in some of the higher data rates, 5 gigahertz stuff, is at 802.11ac. For the end nodes, it's really about driving cost and low power, and the 802.11 and it's a one-by-one solution, so single antenna. So that is basically the minimum cost and longest range. And it's really that  the protocol that is most suitable for IoT end node applications that don't have super high data rates. So we're not talking about high-definition video or something that you would integrate into a phone or a PC, but it would be into devices that are sensors or possibly a camera something that's a few megabits per second.
And so we're focused on integrating the most widely deployed technology and then driving the integration cost and power and performance to the point that's really optimized for these end node applications, so that the Wi-Fi could be more broadly deployed into the market. And again this is, you know, it's not something that would go into an access point PC or handset, it's really for this broad range of applications. And we think that we've got a great solution there that's highly competitive. It's going against the stuff that's coming out from Cypress, that came out of Broadcom and you've got some other competition from Qualcomm and some from MediaTek, but those devices are not as highly optimized as what we've been able to introduce.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
That's really helpful. And as my follow-up, either for Tyson or for John, could you elaborate a little bit more on the sales strategy and also the consolidation of your distributor channel? So I think you even mentioned you're hiring a few more direct sales people. So if you could elaborate a bit more on that that'll also be helpful? Thank you.
John Carter Hollister - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Sure, Tore. This is John. So, we have a large and growing opportunity pipeline of $8 billion growing up to  approaching now $9 billion, and see that as expanding the size of our internal direct sales force, we can optimize our execution and sales and we're targeting to have this initiative drive faster growth for the company over time. And we also decided along with that to consolidate our global distribution to Aero Electronics and look forward to a deeper relationship with them all here going forward.
Tore Egil Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Your line is open.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Thanks for taking the question and I'll echo the congratulations on the good execution guys. I'll just start-off with a question on IoT segment. With Z-Wave in the segment, how does that impact the end-market mix that we'd expect? I think previously, industrial was around 50% of mix. Will it shift more towards other end-markets? And Tyson relative to some of the blue-chip customers that were mentioned, does the addition of Z-Wave create more of a high runner element to that segment versus what we had seen previously?
John Carter Hollister - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yes, Craig. I will take the first part and then send it to Tyson. So, on the industrial mix, please keep in mind the smart home is classified as an industrial application. This is an area where Z-Wave has had a lot of history and strength in the market. So, yes, over time we do think the industrial segment is going to continue to grow as a function of our overall mix and with the smart home being included in that segment as well, will further add to that.
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yeah. Let me add. Z-Wave has had a very strong position in the home security market. So companies like ADT that are rolling out wireless sensors for their security systems, that was very strong. If you look at the Z-Wave ecosystem, there are 600 members of the Z-Wave Alliance and there are over 2,400 devices out into the market supporting the Z-Wave protocol. So, this fits into our, you know, the diversity strategy that we've got within IoT of thousands of applications and tens of thousands of customers and this is bringing on a substantial new number of customers.

I would say that it's not adding to the concentration, it's actually adding to the diversity. And if you just look at the overall company now, we didn't have any customers over 5% and our top 10 customers are right at 20% right now. So it's like we've made a lot of progress in the company towards diversification and driving into the broader market. The sales transformation that we've just gone through is evidence of that of our desire to continue to push this into the broader market. And I think Z-Wave contributes to that diversity going forward.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
That's helpful color guys. And then a follow-up. There were comments on the cash balance $500 million and then the $300 million line of credit that's available. Can you just comment on the milestone, should we be looking at with Z-Wave's integration that would help us understand when the company would be comfortable potentially redeploying some of that cash for further inorganic growth to add technology capabilities? And Tyson, as we think about competencies that the company might want to augment or even add, can you help us understand what that priority list would look like? Thank you.
George Tyson Tuttle - Silicon Laboratories, Inc.
Yes, Craig, the cash position that we have is strong and additionally we feel that the Z-Wave acquisition has gone well, the structure that we were able to achieve and the integration that we were able to implement here on day one, certainly there was a lot of work to go there. But we don't have any deals active right now. But certainly we are looking out in the market for what would make sense.
Some of our selection criteria involve compatible culture, something that's accretive to the bottom-line, something that is strategically aligned with our businesses in IoT and Infrastructure. And there is a number of interesting assets out there, depending on the actionability and all of that, we'll see but certainly we're in a strong position to continue to go both with situation that we have with Z-Wave and the integration and the cash balance that we have. So we're going to continue to be actively looking at the best ways to deploy our capital. We still have $100 million authorization on the share repurchase as well and we will continue to be active on that front.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Thanks, Tyson. Good luck.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you operator and good morning everyone. And just to let you know that Jamie is actually on the ride with clients today, so he's not able to join us this morning, but sends his regards.
So, now I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $8.7 billion, EPS of $2.37, and a return on tangible common equity of 19% on revenue of $28.5 billion, benefiting from broad based strength in performance, but also lower taxes and seasonality.
So, this quarter's performance in context, on a core basis pretax earnings grew 13% year-on-year, benefiting from higher rate, solid growth across other revenue drivers, and continued investments in our businesses. And even excluding the benefit of tax reform, net income was a clear record this quarter.
Included in the results, you see on the page, approximately $500 million of mark-to-market gains on certain investments previously held at cost due the adoption of a new accounting standard. These gains are reported in CIB markets revenue.
Against that, there were a number of other smaller, but nevertheless notable items, including changes in credit reserve, SBA, investment securities, and private equity losses and legal, which together substantially offset those gains.
Underlined results continue to be strong. Average core loan growth excluding the CIB of 8% year-on-year, Card sales and merchant processing volumes up 12% and 15% respective. We maintained our number one rank in global IB fees and have net income of $1 billion in the Commercial Bank. And in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw strong long-term flows [ph] across all regions and 10% AUM growth.
Turning to page two, some more details about the first quarter results. So, before we get into the numbers on the performance drivers for the quarter, I do want to remind you that there have been a couple of adjustments to the numbers on the page which are in line with the guidance that we gave during the fourth quarter.
First, seeing the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. You will recall, this will have the full year impact of grossing up non-interest revenue and expense each by approximately $1.2 billion. The impact for the quarter of about $300 million is included here and prior periods have been similarly restated.
Second, as a result of tax reform, certain tax equivalent adjustments that are included in managed revenue are lower on a relative basis and for that prior periods have not being restated. This impact which was also about $300 million for the quarter, reduced revenues, was split about 50/50 in NII versus NIR, an offset in tax expense.
So, with that, revenue of $28.5 billion was up $2.7 billion or 10% year-on-year. Net interest income was up $1.1 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates. Non-interest revenue was up $1.6 billion year-on-year and while it includes the mark-to-market gains on the first page, it also includes approximately $400 million of losses on investment securities and legacy private equity investments.

Adjusted expense of $16 billion was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth including Auto lease depreciation. Credit cost of $1.2 billion were down $150 million year-on-year. Consumer charge offs were in line with expectations and guidance and there were no changes to reserves this quarter. In wholesale, we had a net reserve release of about $170 million driven by single Oil & Gas names.
You'll see that our effective tax rate for the quarter ended a little above 18% compared to the 17% guidance we gave, driven by a combination of higher pretax earnings as well as geographical mix. We're expecting full year effective tax rate to be closer to 20%.
Shifting to balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the first quarter with CET1 of 11.8%, down about 30 basis points versus last quarter. Capital generated was offset by net capital distributions and changes in AOCI. So, the reduction was driven by higher risk weighted assets reflecting the increased level of market activity, which similarly impacted all other ratios.
In the quarter, the firm distributed $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and last week, we submitted our 2018 CCAR Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve. But as you know, we can't provide any details of that at this stage.
So, before moving on to the lines of business, on page four, I'll briefly address this week's new capital news. Two new capital NPRs were released this week, the Stress Capital Buffer and eSLR. Starting with the Stress Capital Buffer, the proposal was broadly in line with a narrative and expectations that had been set.
There is a comment period, we intend to fully participate in the process and are encouraged that there is an openness from current leadership to really consider feedback from the industry.
On the positive side, we support the convergence of Stress and BAU capital and in general, support simplification of the framework. We believe that firm should be required to hold adequate capital to withstand severe stress, calibrated to firm's specific exposures and risks. We also agree that many of the changes to the construct of the test, for example, not having to hold capital for full distributions during a stress environment, better reflect reality, and Board-approved policies.
That said, stepping right back, if we are fundamentally reconsidering the contrast of minimum capital levels, then all of the building blocks should be in play including the GSIB surcharge to ensure they all hang together. And to reinforce points that we previously made, first and foremost, the fixed coefficients need to be recalibrated in light of the economic growth we've had. Second, the underlying premise for the surcharge and more particularly, U.S. gold plating is somewhat unnecessary for a firm that is compliant with all of the post-crisis reform that directly addresses systemic risks, which includes the severity of the CCAR stress, incorporating material GSIB specific instructions.
Beyond that, obvious challenges with the current proposal includes the significant volatility and opacity in the said results, as well as challenges around implementation. So, getting to the numbers, you can see on the page, our estimated historical Stress Capital Buffer derived from the said result. And while for 2017, it would imply no impact on our minimum capital levels, you can see that in years prior, the buffer would have been higher. And you know that in 2018, the scenario was in many ways more severe and the lower tax rate has a net negative bias.
Further there will potentially be a need for larger management buffers if it is necessary to accommodate significant volatility. So, acknowledging everything that we don't know, it's fair to say that our minimum level of capital including a management buffer would likely be higher under this proposal, but likely still in the range of 11% to 12%.

Briefly on eSLR, as you know, we are not currently bound by leverage. I'm trying to say to you this proposal would reduce the eSLR minimum. So, my primary comment on this is to reiterate my earlier comments about the need to be willing to reexamine the GSIB surcharge regardless of the fact that it reduces the number. Overall, we've been waiting for these proposals and we look forward to participating in the comment process.
Moving to page five and let's start with Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $3.3 billion of net income and an ROE of 25%. Core loans are up 8% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 13%, Business Banking up 7%, Card up 5%, and Auto loans and leases up 6%.
Deposits grew solidly at 6% year-on-year. We believe we continue to outpace the industry, which as we previously noted, is experiencing a slowdown as consumers are increasing their allocations to investments, but also based upon our data, they appear to be spending more, reflecting a continued high level of confidence.
Client investment assets were up 13% year-on-year with half of the growth from net new money flows and with record flows this quarter. And active mobile users were up double-digit.
Revenue of $12.6 billion was up 15% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth. Home Lending revenue was roughly flat, as portfolio loan spread and production margin compression were predominantly offset by higher net servicing revenue.
And Card, Merchant Services, and Auto revenue was up 18% including higher Auto lease income, but it was driven by Card on lower net acquisition costs, higher loan balances as well as margin expansion. The Card revenue rate was 11.6% in the quarter.
Expense of $6.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by investments in technology and marketing. Higher Auto lease depreciation and continued underlined business growth. The overhead ratio of 55% was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter despite seasonally higher payroll taxes and higher marketing expenses.
Finally, on credit, the trends across our portfolio remain favorable. Charge offs were driven by Card and were in line with guidance and there were no reserve actions taken this quarter. Recall, last year included a net impact of a little over $200 million related to the student loan portfolio sale.
Turning to page six and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion and an ROE of 22%. This quarter in Banking, we maintained our number one ranking a global IBCs as well as a number one rank in North America and EMEA. IBCs were $1.7 billion, down 10% from a record quarter last year and strong performance in M&A was more than offset by lower debt and equity underwriting fees.
Advisory fees were up 15% year-on-year as we saw good momentum and some large deal closed. We ranked number one in global M&A wallet and gained share in every region. And for the quarter, we announce and completed more deals than any other bank.
Equity underwriting fees were down 19% in a market that was also down and versus a strong first quarter last year, which included a number of large deals. This quarter we ranked number three in a very competitive environment.
And debt underwriting fees were down 18%, driven by a slow start to the year, primarily due to increased market volatility which reduced issuance. Despite these headwinds, we maintained our number one ranking globally and looking forward to the rest of the year, across products, the overall pipeline remains strong.
Moving onto market, total markets revenue was $6.6 billion, up 13% year-on-year reported. However, as mentioned, this includes the mark-to-market gains we called out on the front page and also includes a reduction of about $150 million reflecting lower tax equivalent adjustments year-on-year. Accounting for both of these items market revenues would have been up about 7%.

Fixed income market's adjusted revenue was flat versus a strong first quarter last year with rates and spread markets reversing to more normal levels following significant outperformance last year, being offset by strong emerging markets and commodities performance.
It was a record quarter for equities and revenue was up 25%. A well-diversified story driven by broad strength and continued momentum throughout the quarter with increased volatility benefiting all of equity derivatives. In addition, we saw share gains in cash and continue client activity driving growth in prime as the investments that we've made the business are paying off.
Treasury Services and Security Services revenue were both $1.1 billion for the quarter and up 14% and 16% respectively, driven by higher rates and balances. Security Services also benefited from asset based fee growth on both market levels and new client activity.
Finally, expense of $5.7 billion was up 9% year-on-year, half being higher compensation expense with a comp-to-revenue ratio of 29% and the remainder primarily driven by higher transaction costs in markets.
Moving to Commercial Banking on page seven. Another very good quarter in this business with net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 20%. Revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII as we continue to benefit from higher rates, partially offset by lower IB revenues.
Sequentially, revenue was down 8%, largely driven by the impact of tax reform. Gross IB revenues of $569 million result 15% year-on-year on a lower overall industry wallet and fewer large transactions versus last year. That said, the underlying flow of business remains robust. In fact, it was a record quarter for middle market clients and the pipeline looked strong.
Expense of $844 million was up year-on-year as we continue to invest in the business, both in bankers and technology. Loan balances were up 6% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 5% on strength in our expansion markets as well as specialized industries, but down 1% sequentially roughly in line with the industry.
CRE loans were up 7% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter as the competition is significantly elevated.
So both, while client sentiment is high in the wake of corporate tax reform and we remain hopeful that this will support higher demand later in the year, we're not seeing that yet and we are maintaining pricing and credit discipline. Finally, credit performance continues to be very good with zero net charge offs this quarter.
Moving onto Asset & Wealth Management on page eight, Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $770 million with a pretax margin of 26% and an ROE of 34%. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposit margin expansion and loan growth.
Expense of $2.6 billion was down year-on-year as the first quarter of last year included nearly $400 million of legal expenses. Adjusted expense would have been up 8%, driven by higher external fees and revenues as well as higher compensation.
For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $16 billion including $5 billion in active equities with strength across all regions benefiting from strong long-term performance. We saw net liquidity outflows of $21 billion, largely driven by a combination of recent M&A activity and the impacts of cash repatriation due to tax reform.
AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 10% and 9% respectively on high market levels globally as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting the migration into investments which we previously discussed, but were about flat sequentially on seasonally higher balances. Finally, we had record loan balances up 12% with strength in both mortgage as well as other loans globally.

Moving to page nine and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $383 million. The net loss of $1.87 million in treasury and CIO was primarily due to losses related to security sales. The net loss of $196 million in other Corporate reflects approximately $100 million after-tax loss on legacy private equity investments, as well as a net tax expense on adjustments and true-up of certain reserves. And you'll recall that last year included a legal benefit and our quarter, of course, included the impact of tax reform.
Finally, turning the page 10. Given Investor Day is only six weeks behind us, we've not changed our guidance for the full year 2018. So, to wrap-up, we are pleased with the firm's performance this quarter with all of our businesses showing continued and broad strength in an overall environment that remains supportive. And while acknowledging the tailwinds of tax reform and higher rates, the consistent performance of business drivers is translating into topline growth and positive operating leverage with revenues and pretax income both up double-digits year-on-year.
So, with that operator, we can take some questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly ma'am. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.
John McDonald
Hi, good morning Marianne. Wanted to talk about LIBOR, we saw big increase this quarter, can you remind us how LIBOR affects you, kind of pros and cons, where do you have LIBOR sensitivity on the asset side and where do you have it on the funding cost sensitivity to LIBOR? And how should we think net-net about that?
Marianne Lake
Yes. Okay, so I'll sort of end with the op shop [ph] which is that net-net the impact to our results in the quarter was very modest positive. So, a pretty small number on the positive direction. And we've actually seen this before, I can't remember, a year or so ago, we are most sensitive as you know to the front-end of rate, but principally to IOER and prime.
So, while we do have exposure to LIBOR repricing, it's both on the asset and liability. As you mentioned, we also have combination of one month and three months LIBOR. So, if you look sort of next across the assets and liability side, they material offset, we don't have sort of significant mismatches. And so as a consequence, obviously, we benefit from a higher level of obsolete short rate, but the basis widening hasn't been very meaningful to our NII. And I mean examples of asset that we price of LIBOR be the Commercial Banking loans and obviously, unhedged or hedged long-term debt on the liability side.
John McDonald
Okay. And then just as a follow-up, wondering about the drivers of the 7% expected growth in fee income for this year. At Investor Day, you mentioned you've got some bounce back from headwinds in Card and markets, but also core growth of -- I think about $2.5 billion you mentioned. So, what are the drivers of that overall 7% fee income if you could just give us some color there that would be great?
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, let's start with sort of three relatively big drivers. So, yes, as we have now sort of latched big Sapphire reserves and high premium vintages, our net acquisition costs are substantially lower and so that is a tailwind. We are seeing regular way BAU growth in Cards, NIR, and -- sort of drivers.
Similarly, mark-to-markets as we talked about after the first quarter performance that's a driver and then as the ongoing sort of growth in the Auto lease income space which is significant. Outside of that, you look at our underlying drivers across the Board in terms of new accounts and debit trends in Card sales and Asset Management fees as a driver too, so there's obviously a level of market dependency to it, but a bit of the sort of outsized year-on-year increase is seeing the -- somewhat tailwind of Card and market, both in the trading and in the Asset Management base.

Operator
Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.
Glenn Schorr
Hi. Thanks very much.
Marianne Lake
Hey Glenn.
Glenn Schorr
Hello. There's a comment in the prepared text on -- in Lending and Commercial banking being intensely competitive and led to no real growth. Yet, I saw your -- the comments about 5% and 7% C&I growth and CRE growth, so I wonder if you could just flush that out a little bit more about the competitive landscape and I guess that's a pricing issue mostly?
Marianne Lake
Yes, I'll start with year-over-year, we're still getting significant benefits from our investment and expansion markets and also as you know we had a pretty -- we have a pretty unique sort of offering in terms of first term lending and so, for a period of time in both of those bases, we've been materially outperforming the market and so we're still seeing the benefit of that in our year-over-year numbers.
Quarter-over-quarter -- and the trouble with C&I loans is there can also be some volatility associated with held-to-sell mortgage portfolio, seasonality -- sorry mortgage warehouse seasonality and stuff like that. So, quarter-over-quarter what we're seeing is just the impact of the sort of overall industry-wide slowdown and the fact that you're right, it's not just pricing, it's just generally we continue to be very selective and cautious given where we are in the cycle, but we're not expecting flat for the year, we're expecting growth in the mid-single-digits for the year and we still believe that there should be demand.
And in the CTL space and commercial real estate [ph] more generally that's where the competition really has stepped up very significantly and that really is where pricing has become fiercely competitive and that's in compression.
Glenn Schorr
Thanks. And I just want to quick follow-up on your other comments related to capital proposals. The simple question I have is hearing you loud and clear on the -- on everything related to risk based capital, but the clear improvement on the leverage side in the SLR, does that -- theoretically I know that's just a proposal right now, would that theoretically free up more activity in repo land and other short-term investments that soak-up leverage capital but not risk -- much risk-based capital?
Marianne Lake
So, generally across the -- sort of whole industry, I suspect the answer to the question is yes, but remember for us that we haven't been constrained by leverage -- Tier 1 leverage or SLR over the last -- over the last several years. And it's a result obviously of the business mix we have and operating model that we have that we can socialize some of our [Indiscernible] results across the company and so we wouldn't expect there are the hedges [ph] and change materially.
Operator
Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.
Michael Mayo
Hi.
Marianne Lake
Hi.
Michael Mayo
Can you just give a little bit more of your expectations for consumer and specifically digital banking? The active online users were up 5% year-over-year, but for the quarter, it was up 12% annualized. And I know there's always risk in annualizing numbers, so is that change in online users seasonal or is it structural, just a little more color on that?
Marianne Lake
Okay. So, I'll give you my best thought. I would say it's a little bit more structural than it is seasonal and we've been seeing continued growth in both digital and especially, the mobile channels. And it's a lot to do with adding features and as we talked about at Investor Day, making it compelling for people to digitally move money, which makes them become much more engaged in all of the good things that come with that.
In addition we talked also I think at Investor Day about the fact that we've recently added digital account opening and so I couldn't give you exact amounts of what is driving -- which ones of those is driving what, but we would continue to expect a bit of a structural acceleration. Certainly we hope for that.

Michael Mayo
And then a follow-up on that. So, is this money stickier or not? And if you could elaborate more on the deposit base, I know you've been pretty cautious in saying that money could flee more easily because of the digital it goes, on other hands, does it become more sticky because you have these connections?
Marianne Lake
Yes, so I think we sort of talked about the fact that -- I did think those customers are more loyal that they spend more and they bring up more deposits in investment. So, we gave you the stat -- that I think at Investor Day, we see more Card spend both debit and credit, but we also see higher deposits and investment, so digitally active customers. So, overall, it's really good for our franchise to have these customers engaged and we hope they also use our branches by the way.
With respect to deposit status, we talked before about the two theses. The first which is the one that we generally subscribe to is that a combination of the ability to use technology, the transparency, and expectation of higher rates as well as potentially overtime, the value of retail deposits the liquidity that we would expect higher reprice. And we haven't changed our expectation on that, but we haven't seen it yet either. So, we're going to have to watch that maybe play out.
There is the other side of that argument that other people -- many people subscribe to which is the customer experience, investments, the convenience, the brand, the marketing, the digital features, the products and services, the reward, all become increasingly important and customers are less price-sensitive.
So, I guess we'll all know it when it finally unfolds. As you know we could have taken a little bit more of a conservative view but where we are right now in the normalization cycle specifically, sort of retail, checking, and savings, as you know we haven't yet seen that unfold.
We have seen migration in Asset, Wealth Management balances and that to be expected to be a leading indicator. So, this will unfold over the course of the next year or so.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
Marianne Lake
Hey Matt.
Matthew O'Connor
Hi, good morning. Can you provide an update on your interest rate sensitivity with the recent move in rates that we've had?
Marianne Lake
I'm sorry, say again.
Matthew O'Connor
Just an update on your interest rate sensitivity from here?
Marianne Lake
Okay. So, we've seen two things happen. I guess we've seen obviously we've rolled forward a quarter. I think our earnings at risk disclose at the end of last quarter was $1.7 billion, you go forward a quarter and that comes down a little less sort of realized rate benefit, but we've also seen as you know somewhere in the sort of mid 40s basis point increase in rates sort of front and long end which will also have a somewhat significant impact. So, $1.7 billion will be down quite meaningfully I would expect at the end of the third quarter, but you'll see those disclosures in our Q.
Matthew O'Connor
Okay. And then just separately within the trading businesses not a surprise there's a big increase in the average VAR, obviously, there's a lot of volatility in the number of products out there or the markets out there. But just anyway to think about like how much the VAR increased? And you had some increase in trading revenues, but maybe not as much as one would think when you see the VAR that much, is there any correlation between those two from [Indiscernible] point of view?
Marianne Lake
Yes, I think it's extremely difficult to draw a straight line between VAR and all of its complexities and revenues in any one quarter. And if I just sort of unpick it for you first -- and by the way, just to reiterate that it's still at relatively low levels relative to historical norms when we've been in more normal trading environments with higher levels of volatility and inventory and the like.

So, I would handpick and say of the increase more than half was related to volatility and obviously some of the volatility was somewhat significant, we wouldn't necessarily expect to see that level continue, albeit that we would expect to continue see periods or episodes of significant volatility and a bit less than half to do with positions principally, but not exclusively as a result of higher levels of client activity in the CIB any sort of balance sheet wants to go up and risk weighted assets and so on.
Operator
Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
Erika Najarian
Hi. Good morning.
Marianne Lake
Hi Erika.
Erika Najarian
Morning. So, my first question to you Marianne is if the Stress Capital Buffer becomes final as proposed and now the industry has a BAU CET1 minimum that could move year-to-year, how does that change your outlook on how to think about dividends and buybacks from here?
Marianne Lake
Okay. So, I mean I would start a little bit with -- so when you say as return, if you take the last years Stress Capital Buffer, you've seen this from history for us that that could be significant. So, there are three observations I would have. The first is when we think about capital planning, I think rightly you would expect us and we do think about over more than a one year cycle and while we have very significant earnings capacity, we don't want to be sort of up and down and sideways and [Indiscernible].
So, I think there will be some implications of the potential for volatility in the calibration of management buffers. And so whether it's in higher or lower SCB or whether it has to be taken into consideration so that we arent caught sideways from a test result that is with respect once a year and a little bit opaque.
The second thing I would highlight to you is for what it's worth, you saw our Investor Day sort of, I won't say guidance, but no sort of indication that we were -- we would expect to try and pay out around 100% off of minus. And you see our ratios are below 12%. So, I think that puts us on reasonably solid booking regardless of the precision of it to sort of understand how the rules play out.
Finally, I hope and I believe, I suspect that through the comment period, the implications of volatility will be properly explored and that hopefully there will be some sort of mechanism considered to accommodate smooth or otherwise allow for things not to be [Indiscernible] around based upon the specificity of the test.
And margin, I guess, the fourth point, it's not something that we overthink is having the full course of dividend explicitly included notwithstanding that this cap [ph] is listed kind of makes it dollar-to-dollar capital. So, at the margin, I guess that makes people think carefully, but we would still want to pay out a strong healthy dividend on growing earnings.
Erika Najarian
Got it. And my follow-up question, I wanted to follow-up to your response to Glenn's question on SLR. I think there was some excitement from your investors if you look at your 4Q banking sub SLR, I think it was 6.7% off of a 6% minimum and that would clearly go to 4.75%. But just to make sure I understood your response even if you could add low risk weight exposure according to that constraint that leverage exposure feeds into the size component of the GSIB surcharge calculation. And so for there to be more freed balance sheet, you also really need to recalibrate the GSIB surcharge. Did they get that?
Marianne Lake
Yes, I mean that's definitely one of the factors. But just the other sort of slightly first order factor is we're running 70 basis points above our minimum. So, if you reduce the minimum by another 100 or 200 basis points whatever the number is, we already had excess capacity. And so when we think about the use of our resources, we obviously think about to maximize SCA [ph]. And so we haven't felt extraordinarily constrained I would say.

So, there's that kind of just sort of basic, we haven't been maybe as constrained as maybe others have seen and that is what it is. And so while we'll continue to make every decision incrementally based upon marginal SCA, but you are right. You have to take into consideration all the local impacts, I mean our stock price alone impacts GSIB.

Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
Betsy Graseck
Hi, good morning Marianne
Marianne Lake
Good morning Betsy.
Betsy Graseck
Question on LIBOR, I know you discussed it relative to the loan book, I'm wondering if you could give us some color on how the LIBOR changes impacted trading?
Marianne Lake
Yes, so look, I would say that in the fixed income spaces was sort of discussion and it was a feature or a factor and even in equities, to be honest, it was part of the discussions. I wouldn't say that we could point to it materially impacting our failing results.
Betsy Graseck
And then the follow-up is just on the mark-to-market gains that you called out the $505 million [ph]. It looks to me like you've called it out as mark-to-market gains on certain equity investments. I just wanted to understand why it's really showing up in fixed income instead of equity trading line, is that the correct interpretation of the slide?
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, think about -- many of these investments are years old -- many years old. And think about them as strategic investments that relate to business activity. For example, if illustratively in financial market infrastructure or clearing and houses or exchanges or so on, all sales and strategic investment potentially related to other parts of the business, so it just happens to be the case that those investments years ago relate and continue to relate to fixed income more than equities. And they were previously ahead of cost, and as there are observable prices as you know this quarter we have to reflect that.
Operator
Our next question--
Marianne Lake
Pretty [Indiscernible] with the investment.
Operator
Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.
James Mitchell
Hey good morning. Maybe just a question on the TCGA [ph], I know that we're all wondering if it's going to have an impact on loan growth, but what about credit, do you think that that has any positive impact, I guess, particularly on the Corporate side with higher cash flows going forward lower tax rate. How do you think about reserving and your expected loss rates going forward?
Marianne Lake
Yes, I would say across the Board actually all the way from full business to middle market, we're expecting sort of higher earnings more free cash and generally speaking, that would improve the sort of credit quality of the portfolio. And we will only really see that come through as we get financials and see that in the financials and label to reflect that in our internal ratings. But we would expect to see some positive lift as a result of that over time.
So, no doubt that helps, but it helps in a rising rate environment and it looks pluses and minuses, but yes, it's a tailwind to credit overall.
James Mitchell
Right, okay. Thanks. And then maybe just following up on asset yields, you saw overall asset yields jump pretty nicely given the higher rate environment, but securities portfolio yields were down, is that sort of a shortening duration or just a mix issue, what shouldnt we expect security sales people moving higher in this environment?
Marianne Lake
Yes you should. What it is actually is the tax equivalent adjustments I mentioned. So, you're seeing that sort of relative impact of lower tax gross-ups and meaning portfolio and investment securities, if you were to adjust to that, they would have been up in line with rates.
Operator
Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.

Kenneth Usdin
Thanks. Good morning. Hey Marianne you mentioned that on the consumer side, you had no incremental reserving actions and I'm wondering if you can just kind of give us a state of the consumer to that extent is -- are you feeling just better or was it also related to kind of just the growth math starting to look a little bit better in Card and Auto?
Marianne Lake
So, I would say we still feel really good about the consumer, really good. And so while you can look at sort of overall sort of levels of consumer indebtedness and look at the fact that they've reached the peak and student lending is driving that in a large part. It's also clearly the case that people had a long time to prepare their balance sheets and term out debt at lower rates and become more liquid and so sort of debt service burdens are still manageable.
And so over -- and confidence is high and that should be a benefit generally speaking. So, overall, we still feel pretty good and it's showing a little bit in our sort of consumer spend data where we're seeing that confidence continues to sort of a spur a bit in spending. With respect to reserves, so our expectation and our belief about the strength of consumer continues to be optimistic. And then further, of course, you know that our portfolio particularly is skewed towards higher quality credit. And so we aren't seeing any signs of fragility or deterioration across the portfolios across the Board. So, hope you get it.
Kenneth Usdin
Got it. And on my follow-up, the Card revenue rate was nice to see it really spike up 11.6% and you guys have been talking about getting it to 11.25% by mid-year. Any updated thoughts on just that trajectory and where you expect that to go over time now?
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, I mean much like we talked about with the Card charge off, right, there is some seasonality. So, the first quarter revenue rate would normally be seasonally higher. Having said that, you're right, we did see some revenue outperformance in the Card space a little bit. And so at this point if you were to ask me 11.25, well, it's it certainly a very, very solid expectation, probably higher for the year.

Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.
Marianne Lake
Hi.
Operator
Mr. Martinez, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Saul Martinez
Hello. Can you hear me?
Marianne Lake
Yes, we can hear.
Saul Martinez
Could you hear me? I'm sorry about that. Sorry little scattered this morning, I have a lot going on. But -- yes, I apologize if you already addressed this question Marianne. But -- can you just talk to the -- how you're feeling about the pipeline in investment banking, obviously it was a little bit of a soft quarter for you and for everybody. And just how are you thinking about the pipeline deal activity in light of Daniels, I think Daniels' guidance at the Investor Day, your expectation is that Advisory and ECM might be up a little bit, ECM down a little bit, I don't know if you guys have any updated thoughts on the outlook?
Marianne Lake
Yes. I mean I just -- first of all, I would just talk a tiny bit about the quarter because I think it's important and it's instructive. First of all, last quarter was a -- this quarter last year, I'm sorry, was a record and so not that we don't always want to [Indiscernible] I still feel like we did pretty well and it's a little bit like the fixed income story last year, equity market in DCM was up and M&A was less strong in this year that turned around and I would say as we look at the results in ECM and DCM that were down, there were a few -- we were under indexed for the larger fee event for a combination of reasons; some outside of our control and some addressable and also some deals that we had hoped to have closed moved into the second quarter, which is all to say that actually if you look across the Board, M&A still look strong, DCM and ECM pipeline also looks strong. Overall, the pipeline is well ahead of this time last year.

So, as long as the market remains constructive, we should continue to see reasonable momentum across products, but as you say, the [Indiscernible] M&A and equities likely to benefit more strongly than DCM in a rate rise environment.
And so confidence is strong, activity levels, you saw volumes are up. We printed number one M&A quarter. So, as long as market volatility regularity given is gone certainty, doesn't escalate within any pretty good about the second quarter and into the year.
Saul Martinez
Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
Gerard Cassidy
Good morning Marianne.
Marianne Lake
Good morning.
Gerard Cassidy
Can you give us any color on when you look at your franchise -- your consumer franchise, is there parts of the country that are more competitive for deposits, whether that's metro New York versus California versus Texas? And could you give us some color on what you guys are seeing geographically on deposit growth in the competition?
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, I mean I'll make to some [Indiscernible] comments and if you still have questions, you can maybe speak to IR, because I don't have everything in front of me. But I will tell you this we compete with everyone across the Board. We compete with the large money center banks, we compete with the regional banks, with local banks, and so there's plenty of competition in all markets and we monitor the market dynamics as you'd say, a pretty granular level and so we will respond accordingly. And I think we do pretty well across the Board and I wouldn't call anyone out as standing out all, anyone out as a clearly being more challenging, but that's an ongoing sort of interesting dynamic process.
So, we compete -- everywhere we compete, we compete with a lot of people who want these high quality liquidity products -- relationships and so do we.
Gerard Cassidy
Okay. And I apologize if you addressed this; I had to jump off the call for a minute. The deposit beta, where does it stand today for you folks? And on your Investor Day, you gave us a very good trajectory of where you think it's going to. Are you still on that trajectory of where you think you should be?
Marianne Lake
Yes. So, with deposit betas, you have to sort of take the because there's a sort of full spectrum. We are, as an industry, firmly on a reprice journey. No doubt. And so the state of play and the maturity of that reprice journey depends upon the specifics of the business and the client. And so at the wholesale sort of top end reprice is really reasonably high. Not to say that there's nowhere left to go, but it's reasonably high and pretty consistent. And as you go down through into the middle market space and small business and all the way down to the retail space, it's still relatively early days given the absolute level of rates. And so we continue to see the journey.
As I said we've seen migrations in [Indiscernible] now for few quarters. As people are sort of reassessing deposits versus investments, we're retaining those investments. So, we feel good about that. But that is generally a precursor to what we will see in retail at some point in future and not yet.
So, with respect the final part of your question which was are we still feeling like the trajectory we showed you is our central case and the answer is yes at this point.
Operator
Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.
Chris Kotowski
Yes, good morning. You touched on this in a tangential way, but let me ask it a different way. If we look at your Card fees on a consolidated basis back in 2014, 2015 before you had the Sapphire launch, it was running around $1.5 billion a quarter, it bottomed out late 2016 and early 2017 at $900 million and now you're up to $1.275 billion. Should we expect -- as Sapphire completely mature, should we expect that to go back to the $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion a quarter or is that ancient history and not indicative of anything?

Marianne Lake
So, I can't really comment on dollars, I'll tell two things. The first is that we've given you -- so to 2018, our expectation of the revenue rate that will be now likely above the 11.25% we previously said. I will tell you we are largely we have lacked, we have lacked the Sapphire reserve quarters now, right, so the big quarter is the hundred, thousand, point premium quarters, those were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter -- the fourth quarter of 2016, the first quarter of last year. So, I would call that in the rearview mirror now and from here, we grow with the growth in the accounts and the businesses and the spend.
So, we still expect to grow. But remember also in that rebase lining and I can't remember which period you called out, but also remember we have gone through a whole renegotiation of all our Card co-brand relationships that have an impact. So, growth will be an offset. We've had some structural stepdown for the reprice of the co-brand, there's still great partnerships and we consider it very valuable. Sapphire we're lacked and from here, hopefully we just continue to grow.
Chris Kotowski
Okay. All right. That's it for me. Thank you.

Our next question is from Al Alevizakos of HSBC.
Al Alevizakos
Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. I was wondering equities clearly was strong in the quarter, but I was wondering if you could give us some geographical split. I'm particularly interested since I'm based in Europe to see if you witnessed any impact from the new regulation especially MiFID II in either cash or derivatives? Thank you.
Marianne Lake
Sure. So, let me just start like at the top of the house and say we've been talking about globally investing in bankers and sales people and technology and building out our platforms across cash and prime space. It is the case because we were not competitive in the international synthetic prime years ago and we now have among best-in-class sort of platform that that has been part of the growth drivers, I would say EMEA, international primers has been a bright spot, generally MiFID II.
So, I would say that there was a concern about pullback in trading. We saw a bit of hesitation, particularly as in fixed income, less so in equities, but the market was generally be quite resilient and so we're still only relatively early days. And within the result that we had articulated to you, we've seen material increases in EMEA electronic trading, which we think will be likely somewhat permanent where people are choosing to do high touch cash trading, we're seeing some concentration among players which is all to say that we are seeing the industry wallet decline and margins compressed, but for us in particular, we're also benefiting from higher volumes. We think we're gaining share and we're benefiting from some of that concentration among top players. So, net-net, yes, I think we're seeing some pressure on the in scope wallet, but less so than you would think for us and its early days, but we'll just have to keep watching it.
