Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric third-quarter 2018 earnings conference call. At this time all participants in a listen-only mode. My name is Brandon and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over your host for today's conference Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Communications please go ahead
Todd Ernst - General Electric Co.
Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to GE's third quarter earnings webcast. I'm joined this morning by our Chairman and CEO Larry Culp, and CFO Jamie Miller. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release, presentation, supplemental and 10-Q have been available since earlier today on our Investor website at www.ge.com. Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward-looking statements and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filing and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Larry. Larry.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Todd, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot to share with you, so let's get to it. During the third quarter, we saw positive results in most segments with outstanding performance in our Aviation (01:36-02:19)
Now, I know there's been renewed speculation on our future strategic direction. The strategy we announced on June 26 to create a more focused portfolio that sets up our businesses to win and strengthening our balance sheet is today the right plan going forward.
Consistent with this strategy, we are announcing two actions this morning. First, GE plans to reduce its quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.01 per share beginning with the board's next dividend declaration, which is expected to occur in December 2018. This change will allow GE to retain about $3.9 billion of cash per year compared to the prior payout level. Going forward, we will target a dividend payout ratio in line with peers over time.
Second, we will take a materially different approach to running our Power business. The past 30 days, I've spent a lot of time with Russell Stokes and his team. It has become clear to us that we need to simplify the business structure. Therefore, today, we are announcing our intent to reorganize Power into two units, both of which will report directly to me. The first is a unified Gas lifecycle business combining our product and services group gas power systems and power services with the second constituting the portfolio of Steam, Grid, Nuclear, and Power Conversion.
Additionally, we intend to consolidate the Power headquarters, Gas Power systems and Power Services teams into the new Gas lifecycle business, effectively eliminating the Power headquarters structure. We have much more to do to improve our performance in Power and we intend to move quickly to enhance our execution agility and improve our cost structure.

These actions are a start in bolstering GE for the road ahead. In the last month, I have visited many of our primary business locations. Getting to know this company better from the inside has only strengthened my conviction that GE has considerable strengths. The talent here is real. The technology is special. And the global reach of the GE brand and our relationships are truly impressive.
But GE needs to change. Our team knows this. In my old job, we acquired dozens of good but often underperforming businesses. And we always came prepared to convince the acquired teams that they and we needed to drive change. That is not the case here. Our GE team needs no convincing.
They really want direction to know how to change. And while I don't have all the answers after one month, I do have a few early impressions. We could use a lot more out and a good bit less up around here, meaning we need to focus more on customers and competition and, frankly, less on corporate.
We're going to strike a better balance between managing and reporting so that we ensure we're properly focused on the daily operating rhythms, which drive our actual financial results well ahead of our reporting cycles. Strong daily management makes reporting a lot easier. First things first
And we need to accelerate our progress on cash generation. Changes to our compensation system and internal reporting this year were a good start, but we need to operationalize real improvements on cash through business processes in every business, every day.
And with that, let me turn it to Jamie for a more detailed discussion of the quarter.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Thanks, Larry. I'll start with our consolidated quarterly performance. Orders were strong at $31.4 billion, up 7% reported and 13% organically. This was driven by equipment orders, which were up 22% organically and services up 5%. Revenues were down 4%, with Industrial revenues down 5%. Organically, Industrial revenues increased 1% driven by Renewables, Aviation, Healthcare, and Oil & Gas.
Industrial profit, which includes Corporate, was down 23% reported and 17% organically, driven by declines in Power and Renewables, partially offset by solid growth in Oil & Gas, Aviation and Transportation. Industrial profit margins were 8.1% in the quarter, down 180 basis points year-over-year on a reported and organic basis, driven by declines in Power and Renewables. Year-to-date, margins were down 50 basis points organically.
Net earnings per share was negative $2.62 which includes income from discontinued operations related to GE Capital. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.14 and I'll walk the GAAP continuing EPS to adjusted EPS on the right-hand side of the page. Starting from GAAP continuing EPS of negative $2.63, we had $0.01 of gains, principally from the sale of Value-Based Care, partially offset by held-for-sale marks in Lighting, Aviation and Power.
We also booked multiple impairments this quarter related to Power. The first was goodwill. As disclosed previously, we had a thin margin between fair value and carrying value for both Power Generation and Grid. And in the third quarter, both businesses failed their goodwill impairment test, which required us to fair value the assets of the businesses with any remaining value being allocated to goodwill.
The size of the charge results from the significant value associated with the unrecognized legacy assets, principally our profitable services backlog, long-standing customer relationships and our gas turbine technology. And the value of these assets essentially squeezed out any remaining room for goodwill.
Based on our best estimate, we booked a charge of $22 billion, $19 billion related to our Power Gen reporting unit and $3 billion related to Grid. Most of the $22 billion charge is related to the Alstom acquisition, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. We will true this up in the fourth quarter as it gets finalized.

Also, the SEC expanded the scope of its ongoing investigation to include the goodwill charge. The Department of Justice is also investigating this charge. And the other areas that we have previously reported are part of the SEC's investigation. We are cooperating with the SEC and DOJ as they continue their work on these matters.
On restructuring and other items, we had $0.05 of charges related to intangibles and long-lived assets in Power Conversion where we continue to restructure the business in the face of market challenges. We also incurred $0.06 of restructuring, principally in Corporate and Power, $0.02 of charges related to BD transactions and $0.01for our share of Baker Hughes GE's restructuring. Lastly, the remaining $0.01 related to an unrealized mark associated with our equity investment in Pivotal. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS was $0.14 in the quarter.
Moving to cash, adjusted Industrial free cash flow was $1.1 billion for the quarter and negative $300 million year to date. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $1 billion after adjusting for the $22 billion non-cash goodwill impairment. Working capital was negative $100 million for the quarter as we had a small build in inventory ahead of fourth quarter shipments offset by increased payables volume. Contract assets were a use of cash of $100 million, and we spent $900 million in gross CapEx or $600 million ex Baker Hughes GE.
On the right-hand side of the page, you can see the walk of the GE cash balance. We ended third quarter with $9.1 billion of cash in bank excluding Baker Hughes GE. And a few highlights: we generated cash proceeds of $3.2 billion related to businesses' positions, principally Industrial Solutions and Value Based Care. We assumed $6 billion of debt from GE Capital to fund the principal plan. And $2.4 billion of other cash includes investing activity in our Aviation business from the first half of the year, derivative settlements and FX on our cash, and a few other items.
While our businesses are generating cash flow along with expectations, it's clear that with respect to Power the issues will persist longer and with deeper impact than we had initially expected which will cause us to significantly miss our full year cash flow and earnings targets.
Next I'll discuss financial policy which reflects our strategic commitment to strength and delever the balance sheet. A solid rating is important to us, and we will target a sustainable credit rating in the single A range. S&P downgraded GE and GE Capital's credit rating from single A to BBB+ with a stable outlook on October 2, and Moody's and Fitch have our ratings on review.
The impact of the downgrade is manageable, and we were prepared for this. The most pronounced impact is on our commercial paper program. As you know, we have $40 billion of committed credit lines in place. We have tapped a portion of these revolvers and are currently transitioning our commercial paper program to a smaller size, and this is in line with our long term objective of reducing our reliance on commercial paper. We have sufficient liquidity to execute this transition smoothly.
We continue to target a leverage ratio of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA and expect to make substantial progress toward this goal in the next few years. As described in June, we have significant sources available to delever and de-risk the company. The action we announced today on the dividend is an example of strengthening our position.
We also continue to complete the remaining actions and transactions that are part of the $20 billion disposition program with an expected close of Distributed Power in the fourth quarter and Transportation by early 2019.
Now, I will turn to take you through the third quarter operating results by segment. Starting with Power, which has faced significant external and internal challenges, the market size continues to be in line with our previous expectations. But as we move into the second half it's clear that our previous forecasts were overly optimistic on the timing and level of deal closures on heavy-duty gas turbines and particularly on aeros. And while we are seeing some progress, we're not seeing the pace of operational improvement we expected. And we continue to see issues driven by our own execution and some on project execution with customers and partners.

Additionally, as Larry mentioned earlier, we're announcing our intent to reorganize the Power business into two units and are effectively eliminating the Power headquarters structure with an intent to enhance Power's execution agility, improve their cost structure and drive better outcomes.
Now with respect to the third quarter results for Power, orders were down 18% reported and down 3% organically. While Gas Power Systems orders were down 45% year to date, they were up 55% in the quarter based on easy comparison. We booked orders for 21 heavy-duty gas turbines, including five HAs. Aero orders for two units were down seven versus last year. Power Services orders were down 16% driven by tough comparison and a more disciplined deal selection process on the transactional fleet which is resulting in higher margins. CSA orders were flat.
Revenue was down 33% reported and down 20% organically. GPS revenue was down 55% on lower volume. Power Services revenue was down 4% with CSA's up 2% and transactional services down 12%.
While we're making progress commercially on the transactional fleet, the conversion time between orders and revenue has been longer than expected and CSA utilization was in line with expectations.
In the quarter, the business incurred an operating loss of $631 million, profitability was negatively impacted by charges in GPS related to challenges in project execution and liquidated damages. We also recorded $240 million of warranty and maintenance reserves related to the HA 9FB stage 1 blade issue.
We have a replacement blade in production and we're working proactively with our customers to schedule outages to replace the parts over time, but we also expect to incur a similar incremental amount of cost over time related to the blades as we perform planned outages in our services contracts.
Next on Aviation, which had another great quarter, orders were up 35%, equipment orders grew by 82% driven by continued strong momentum of the LEAP engine program, services orders grew 12%, revenues in the quarter grew 12%, equipment revenues were up 17% on commercial engines partially offset by lower military volume.
Specifically, we shipped 303 LEAP engines this quarter, up 192 units compared to last year. Services revenues grew 9% on higher shop visits and a spares rate of 28 million per day, up 20%. We continue to experience favorability and services with strength in air traffic driving high fleet utilization and spare parts consumption.
Segment profit was up 25% on higher volume, improved price and operating productivity. This was partially offset by negative mix from higher LEAP shipments. Operating profit margins expanded 240 basis points in the quarter. Year to date, we've shipped 739 engines and we're roughly four weeks behind on production as a result of the delays in material, but we remain committed to delivering 1,100 to 1,200 units. Aviation performance remains on track to deliver 15-plus percent op profit growth for the year.
Next on Healthcare, Healthcare orders were flat versus last year and up 3% organically. On a product-line basis, Life Sciences orders were up 6% organically with BioProcess up 9%, Healthcare Systems orders were up 2% organically. Geographically, organic orders were up 4% in Europe, driven by successful new product launches across Healthcare System. The U.S. was down 3% due to the non-repeat of a large Healthcare Systems government order. Emerging market organic orders were up 9% with China up 13%. And in China, we saw good performance in BioProcess, imaging and ultrasound.
Healthcare revenues of $4.7 billion grew 3% on an organic basis with Healthcare Systems up 3% and Life Sciences up 5%. Segment profit was up 2% on a reported basis and 10% organically, driven by volume and cost productivity partially offset by lower price. Margins expanded by 120 basis points organically. Consistent with our strategy to focus and win, the Healthcare team continues to prepare for separation.

On Renewables, orders were down 3% versus last year, driven by lower hydro orders. Onshore wind orders totaled $2.7 billion with U.S. equipment volume up 2.7 times and U.S. repower volume up 72%. International volume was down 66% on tough comps versus last year. Backlog at the end of the quarter totaled $16 billion and was up 17% from strength in onshore wind. Revenues were up 15% reported and 19% organically, mainly driven by onshore wind equipment, which was up 37%. This was partially offset by onshore wind repower volume, which was down 55%, primarily driven by timing, including delays for inclement weather and customer site readiness, as well as a number of new unit delivery delays driven by supply chain issues. The repower market remains robust and we're seeing continued strong demand through 2019 and beyond.
Segment profit was down 72% and margins were down 660 basis points, driven by significant pricing pressure and lower repower volume. We expect sequential improvement in our segment profit driven by higher wind turbine and repowering volume and continued product cost improvement. We will continue to monitor the supply chain and logistical issues as we ramp in fourth quarter for the higher volume.
Moving to Oil & Gas, Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning at 6:45, and Lorenzo and Brian will hold their earnings call with investors today at 9:00 AM.
Next, we provide the summary financial results for Transportation and Lighting, shown here, and additional information is available in the 10-Q.
Finally, on GE Capital, continuing operations generated net income of $19 million in the quarter, down $5 million from the prior year. Total year earnings will be affected by the timing of asset sales and related gains and losses. Additionally, the business may be impacted by updates to U.S. tax reform legislation and our assessment of the insurance reserves in the runoff insurance business which we perform annually in the fourth quarter.
GE Capital ended the quarter with $129 billion of assets, down $11 billion year to date, ex liquidity, and we remain focused on shrinking and deleveraging GE Capital, including improving its leverage profile. We expect to reduce GE Capital's commercial paper balance to zero in the fourth quarter of 2018 as we transition the overall company to a smaller CP program. And as it relates to capital contributions, we're monitoring tax reform, WMC and the fourth-quarter insurance reserves evaluation and we continue to evaluate derisking options for the portfolio.
At this point, we're planning at least $3 billion of capital contributions in 2019 and we'll continuously assess the capital adequacy and risk profile of GE Capital. GE Capital's resources are more limited as it shrinks and GE may need to support GE Capital further, if necessary, either to achieve desired capital levels or to execute strategic options around its portfolio.
There was a new insurance accounting standard issued in August of 2018. We're evaluating the effect of the standard and anticipate its adoption will materially affect our financial statements when it takes effect in 2021.
Now, I'll turn it back to Larry.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Jamie, thanks. Right now, I'm spending most of my time with the Power business with real help from Jamie and our Vice Chair, David Joyce. We need to establish a realistic outlook there, particularly for the Gas business, and drive improvements from there. The moves we've announced today, in addition to the daily, weekly and monthly operating disciplines we are instilling, will drive transparency and accountability on the path to improved operating performance. When we have our arms around this, we will provide you with our outlook in 2019.

As I mentioned earlier, we also intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy and are committed to strengthening and delevering the balance sheet over the next few years. In summary, GE has and will continue to have a strong commitment to all its stakeholders. We are making GE a stronger company operationally and financially. I'm truly excited to lead this storied company into its next chapter. I've spent my career improving strong franchise businesses and taking them from good to great. We know what to do. Now is the time to execute.
Before we go to Q&A, I want to acknowledge the pent-up demand for information that you have on a range of topics, but I've been in this job for all of 30 days. I will share with you what I know and can today, but please know that I'll be back to you with more definitive plans and views in the months ahead.
In closing, I also want to thank John Flannery for his 30 years of exceptional service to this company. John also made a number of important contributions as CEO. I have the utmost respect for John and wish him nothing but the best going forward.
With that, Todd, back to you.
Todd Ernst - General Electric Co.
Thanks, Larry. Brandon, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And from Vertical Research we have Jeffrey Sprague. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Hey, Jeff. Good morning.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Good morning. Larry, best of luck. Hey, my first question, and I think it's everyone's question really, is the balance sheet here. And just wondering as you're sitting there with your fiduciary hat on looking at an unstable, perhaps, global economic environment, certainly relative to what the market's telling us, do you see the need to move more quickly on the balance sheet?
Is there something with these lawsuits or something that tie your hands on moving with the balance sheet? Could you just give us a little bit more color on how you might move to more quickly lift the cloud and stabilize things here?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Jeff, let me take that, and then Jamie probably has some perspectives as well. I think we're mindful of the morphing environment, but perhaps more mindful of our leverage situation today. So, coming in as a Director earlier in the year, that was clear. All the more true today as Chairman and CEO. I think what we've tried to do throughout the course of the year is move as briskly but smartly as we possibly can. The dividend move today, to me, fundamentally straightforward, given our desire to preserve that cash to help delever the business. We have a lot of options. We laid these out, I think, in some detail back in June. Certainly, the strategy that we talked about relative to derisking and focusing the portfolio is very much intact today. How we move through those various options, the timing, the pace, the sequencing, something very much on the table to make sure that we tend to the balance sheet as quickly as we can. We don't want to be rushed. We don't want to be rash, but we need to get after this straightaway and I hope today's move on the dividend is evidence of that intent in action.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yeah, and the only other thing I would add, Jeff, you mentioned lawsuits. There really is no consideration around that in terms of something that would be a constraint to that plan.
Operator
And from JPMorgan, we have Steve Tusa, please go ahead.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Hey, Steve. Good morning.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Hey. Good morning, Larry. So, I guess as a fresh voice in the room there, you guys kind of addressed the insurance thing, that seems like it's going to be a little bit bigger than expected but there's been a lot of information coming out from these disclosures from the shareholder lawsuits that talks about the accounting for LTSAs and contract assets. Several whistleblowers out there talking about the behavior in the past. I'm wondering, in your seat, if you've really delved into that and you're comfortable enough there to unequivocally rule out the need for more capital and specifically the potential for an equity raise?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Steve, there are a number of questions there. Let me try to take them in order. Let me state in a straightforward fashion, we have no plans for an equity raise. I think with respect to the service business within Power, this is a good opportunity for us to frankly manage this franchise better than we have. I've been encouraged by what I've seen at the operational level. Clearly there are a lot of issues from the past that the team is dealing with but the opportunity here to work closely with our customers around this installed base and do so in a way that's a win-win for them and for us I think it's clear. I'm excited about this. Now it's not a business in the state that it should be in, or could be in, will be in, but I think a good bit of the time we've spent with Russell and Scott and the team has been very much geared toward putting those improvements in motion. I think as we exit this year, go into next year, at the operational level look for continued progress there.
Operator
And from Melius Research, we have Scott Davis. Please go ahead.
Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Hey, Scott. Good morning.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Hi, Scott.
Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC
Welcome, Larry, and good luck to you. It's not going to be an easy job, got a lot to fix. I wish you the best of luck.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Well, I appreciate that Scott.
Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC
Better you than me.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Any time you want to join us, let me know but I'm excited to be here. This is an outstanding company right. The people here I think are strong. The technology again is impressive and in 30 days I've begun to appreciate all the more the reach and the impact this company has around the world. We can do better than where we are today, but this is an important company and I'm pleased to be on the team.
Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC
We're glad to have you. But anyway so, my question really is on the business model at GE, it's so different than Danaher. The two biggest businesses, Power and aircraft engines, the company is willing to sell the unit at a big loss in hopes of capturing the spare parts and that seems to be working in aerospace but doesn't seem to be working in Power. Can you fix Power without fixing how you go to market traditionally? Does something drastically need to change there?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Well, Scott, it's hard to say that we don't need dramatic or drastic change in a business that is performing the way that Power is, right? I mean, in some respects, it's that simple. So, in my mind, beyond compliance and quality, everything is on the table at Power and I think Russell and the team would echo that if they were the call. There's no question that in my prior life I was really on the periphery of both the Power space and aerospace as well.
Certainly, in the heart of Healthcare, but I'm of the view that there's a lot that I've done previously that's relevant as I join this team. I've driven a lot of change. Every time we brought a new company in, we were driving a lot of change. That was effectively the value proposition for our investors and I think over time we were able to do that. That change really comes as a function of revisiting assumptions, clarifying strategy, putting the right team together, driving operations day in, day out and clearly deploying capital in and around that business as appropriate.

But in a more fundamental level, Scott, it's really about expectations, right? It's about making sure that problems are surfaced and solved and managing in a substantive not superficial way. I think all that's relevant. But to be clear, this isn't about me. This is about the 300,000 people on the payroll, myself included, that want and are committed to having GE in a better place and performing better, both for our customers and for shareholders.

From Citi, we have Andrew Kaplowitz. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Good morning, guys
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Andrew, good morning.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Hey, Andrew.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Larry or Jamie, obviously, you didn't give us EPS or cash guidance for the year, but industrial free cash flow in Q3 was arguably not as bad as feared. You did say that you would significantly miss your previous cash flow and earnings target for the year. How should we think about GE's ability to generate earnings and especially cash in what seasonally is usually a strong Q4. And then, really more importantly, when we think about next year, are there any guide posts you would give us at this point as you review the businesses, Larry? Should the Power business in particular be less of a drag on cash in 2019?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yeah. So, let me take the first discussion on that one. So, as you noted, we're not offering updated guidance right now. But as we look at the businesses, we see real strength in Healthcare and in Aviation. And in Power, we just are seeing continued impacts from the lower market penetration I talked about. Deal closure delays and uncertainties and just other operational and project execution issues, and we do see those continuing into 2019.
But as we pull back, fourth quarter, as you referenced, has always been a significant volume quarter for GE and we expect this fourth quarter to be the same. Again, with strong volume in units at Aviation, Healthcare, Renewables and at Power, and Power is also back-end loaded historically, which is another reason that as we really look at Power and the visibility we have there, both with respect to the market and the operations, we're positioning our views on that right now the way we are
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Andrew, Larry here. I hope that you and others will appreciate that when we talk about numbers on a forward-looking basis, we want to do so with conviction and confidence. I don't want to fool you, let alone myself, in thinking 30 days in that I can give you that today. So, with respect to the quarter and certainly the outlook for next year, there'll be a time and place for that. But make no mistake, we know that the Power business has to perform better and that is what we're going to spend a ton of time on once we get past earnings today.
Operator
Thank you. From Deutsche Bank, we have Nicole DeBlase. Please go ahead
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Larry.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Good morning, Nicole
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, I guess maybe we could talk a little bit about Power. So, just based on the actions that you're announcing today, is there any sense of the level of savings that those like the headquarter consolidation could actually drive, just to give us a sense of what the baseline of savings could be as we move into 2019?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Nicole, I think what we've done today is really share both internally and publicly the organizational architecture, if you will, that we have in mind. There are a number of details that Russell, the team and I will be working through in the days and weeks to come. And as those details become more clear, we'll share those first internally, and then we will share them with you and others publicly.

So give us a little bit of time to work through that. I think in the interim we want to leave that open. But I would just underscore that while there is an opportunity to improve our cost structure, dare I say it, imperative given our current performance, a good bit of what we are talking about here is also geared toward running the businesses better. I think by consolidating the headquarters and really putting that support around the Gas business, we'll all have a better line of sight on the action day-to-day in that business and be able to make decisions I think more crisply with more transparency and more accountability.
Having the rest of that Power portfolio coming in directly as well through a different path will give us an opportunity to see those P&Ls clearly without any noise and work business by business to drive improvements there. And I think that's a better way for us to operate. We can come together and do things together that make sense, but we're going to make sure that we're maximizing and optimizing those individual businesses first.
Operator
From Barclays, we have Julian Mitchell. Please go ahead.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Good morning.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Good morning, Julian
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Good morning, Julian.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good morning. Maybe my question would be around GE Capital. Jamie, you had talked about more work to be done looking at the liabilities relating to tax, WMC, insurance and so on. Obviously that will set alarm bells ringing given the scale of miscalculations at things like insurance and so forth. So maybe just give us an update on how sizable you think some of these liabilities might be? Is there a risk that they do end up similar to the scale of the insurance adjustment earlier in the year?
And also related to that, maybe I missed it, but I didn't see any reiteration of the $25 billion capital asset sale plan by the end of 2019, so I just wondered if you have an update on the pace of those asset exits at Capital?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Sure. So with respect to the first piece, at this point we see at least $3 billion of capital contributions into GE Capital, as I mentioned. We continue to shrink GE Capital, and we still are on our plan for $25 billion of asset reductions. To date we've seen asset reductions via sale of about $7 billion. You saw $11 billion down on the balance sheet. A lot of that is just seasonal timing and some other shifting. And we do expect to see another big tranche be sold in the fourth quarter, so well on track there.
And then with respect to the other elements we're monitoring, it's a little bit of a moving target. We monitor tax reform. We've got some interpretations we expect to either be cleared up or sent out in the fourth quarter. That could cause some tax adjustments in the fourth quarter for GE Capital. WMC is something we continue to monitor, and then our annual fourth quarter insurance evaluation as well. With respect to that, we just reset that last year, as you mentioned. And interest rates are up more than planned, which is helpful, but it's a process we go through. And it's something we're monitoring.
And I'd say when I look out in 2019, 2020 and beyond, GE Capital's resources are just more limited as it shrinks, so GE may need to support GE Capital further if necessary. And when we think about either achieving desired capital levels, derisking debt maturities, those are the kinds of things we're thinking about. But right now as we look at 2019, we see the three things I mentioned as the monitoring point.

Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, Larry. So you mentioned obviously the portfolio plan laid out in June remains the base case, and that profile plan's key levers in delevering and derisking balance sheet. Can you just give us an update on the timing on the moving pieces for Baker Hughes and GE Healthcare? That's the first part of my question. And the second part would be, you've obviously spent most of your time so far with Power. Obviously, Power results this quarter were less than – obviously, well below what we expected. Can you maybe just quantify what those onetime items were hitting the P&L this quarter? And how you see the path of cost reduction in Power progressing? Thank you.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Sure. Sure. Nigel, I would say with respect to the strategy, again, what we're reinforcing today is the strategic framework that we highlighted in June with respect to derisking and delevering the balance sheet and really setting the businesses up to win and, in some cases, businesses in an independent form. You mentioned Healthcare. We talked about that back in the summertime. Today, I don't think we really have much to say relative to Baker Hughes. They've got their earnings call here shortly.
I think what we can say is that our intent, as expressed in June, holds and that you should expect us, in an orderly fashion over several years, to implement that objective. I think with respect to Healthcare, we're still of the view that Healthcare operating in an independent form is probably what is best for that business and that team. Might the timing and sequencing there change relative to some other things that we're working on, too early to tell, but it's certainly something that Kieran [Murphy] and I have been talking about.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yeah, and I'll jump in here on Power, you asked about the negative Op profit in the quarter and some of the different charges. So I talked through earlier the goodwill and the Power Conversion intangibles. Focusing on Power operations, in the quarter, we had $240 million of charges on the blade issue with respect to warranty and maintenance reserves. We saw about $400 million of project reserves and other execution issues and about $150 million of just some other execution issues. We saw lower volume in the quarter and if you really put that back together, Power probably came in about as expected operationally, with the exception of these charges that are incrementally flowing through.

Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Covered a lot of territory so far and maybe some broad brush questions for you, Larry. First would be, what do you think are the – 30 days in, the biggest misperceptions that people on the outside have right now about GE? And then related is, you're coming in from the outside and you're basically on unfamiliar ground. You're surrounded by senior managers who didn't grow up with DBS, don't know the playbook. How are you set with building out your team, basically your inner circle of advisers?
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Sure. Well, let me take those in order. The biggest misperceptions, Deane, there are a lot of people around GE that know the company far better than I do, right. In this role for 30 days, on the board for less than a year, I won't claim any special expertise but, again, I think as you get into the business, I have been truly impressed with the talented people I've met really around the world. This team's been through a lot the last several years. The company perhaps doesn't enjoy the reputation in certain quarters that it once did. But people here are committed to embracing that reality and changing it. And I take a lot of comfort and strength from that.

Frankly, I'm not sure when my board colleagues came to me, that I would've stepped into this role hadn't I been out on the road over the course of the summer. Visiting our business and our team in China, getting the opportunity to walk a couple of plants in Power, getting out with David Joyce and the Aviation team and really seeing the strengths of GE that go a bit perhaps underappreciated today.
And I don't want that to sound like I'm sugar-coating our reality. This is not a quarter that we're particularly proud of, but, that said, Aviation knocked the cover off the ball and Healthcare wasn't too far behind, Transportation in a good place. We really like what we're going to do strategically there with the merger.
So there are good things going on here. That doesn't necessarily take away from today's headlines, but there are things we can do to build on, this team, these assets, these strengths and that's what we're going to do.
With respect to the team, Deane, you and I both know, we share a passion for the local ballclub here. Alex Cora just won a World Series, as best I can tell, largely with the team that was on the field a year ago that didn't do so well. So I am listening to a lot of people here in these first weeks. That will continue, listening, learning. But again, I feel good about the group that we have here and we're committed to building a stronger General Electric.

From Bank of America Merrill Lynch we have Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Good morning. We've been getting a lot of question on GE Capital, particularly the aircraft leasing business. Can you just walk us through what you guys are seeing in terms of book value of the assets? And just a broader question, as you look at GE Capital and as you sort of make a statement about no capital raise, does that mean that you feel that GE Capital – you are comfortable with where GE Capital values are or are you saying that, look, I'm only in for 30 days and it's going to take us a while to get through those? So just two-part question. Thank you.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yes. Andrew, on GECAS, I would say with respect to asset values there, we're not seeing anything unusual come through. We can work with you through more offline to give you more specifics if there are specific questions on that. And then with respect to the discussion about an equity raise, I'm not sure I have anything more to add to what Larry said before.

Larry, if I think back to when Dave Cote took over Honeywell and Ed Breen took over Tyco in similarly difficult times and you've got Capital, the thing that's striking the most to me is at least these expanded investigations that came out today and the ongoing question about faith in the numbers that you've got to base your decisions on. So just trying to get a sense for what is giving – where are you in kind of your continuum of getting confidence into the underlying numbers that are at the core of basing the rest of the decisions on?
And just before I go, if you can also just address Healthcare. You're saying it's very strong. Just seemed a little flat in terms of the growth up 3%. The rest of the segment peers seem to be doing a little bit better, a little confidence there, too, would be helpful. Thanks.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
Yes. Steve, I would say with respect to my discovery work here and beginning to kick things into gear, it's early, but where I'm focused primarily is what we can change going forward in terms of the trajectory and the underlying performance. I think part of what we need to do at Power is wring out a little bit of the undue optimism that I think we referenced in our prepared remarks so that we can establish a baseline that we can build on, a baseline, frankly, for our own internal processes, let alone when we're talking about the business on the outside.

In that regard, again, it's early, but I have conviction that there are things to build upon, there are improvements that are well within our reach and we just need to do that. And that's – again, it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take some time, but I'm hopeful that we can build that credibility, deliver that performance over time.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Hey, Steve. And just a quick comment on Healthcare, as you asked about. Healthcare revenues were up 3% on an organic basis. We saw segment profit up 10%, a consistent basis. And when you really peel back the layers, we're seeing very consistent growth across the different regions, as well as in the product line.
U.S. was down a bit this quarter. We expected to have tough comps again in the fourth quarter, but largely driven to big orders we had last year from the VA in the U.S. China strength continues. And what the business is really doing well is getting a really nice mix of growth in the market coupled with strong cost control and a real steady focus on how they're investing in R&D, so nice profile
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.
And Steve, just to be clear, I think we're well aware that Aviation really was the standout force in the third quarter of this year. My comments about the strength of the Healthcare business were not rooted into the last 90 days but really looking at that business on a prospective basis. I think it's an outstanding business there, well positioned in a number of attractive submarkets, and we intend to grow that going forward.

John Walsh - Credit Suisse
Hi. So I wanted to actually talk about Aviation because that was clearly a source of strength in the quarter, and you reiterated your view of 15% plus on the OP line there. So that does imply sequentially that the margins are lighter. Obviously there is the LEAP ramp, or there's higher LEAP in Q4. But as we think about that longer term because it will be a big driver of the future GE, do you still believe the construct of holding the margins while you ramp LEAP is the right way to think about that business? Or has anything changed there?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yeah. I'll give a little bit of context on the quarter, the year and just a macro level. In the quarter, we just continue to see real underlying strength in the business. Global passenger travel up 6.8% year-to-date, passenger load factors at all-time high, which just means our engines are just flying more, which means we bill more hours under services contracts, we consume more parts as they go in for maintenance.
We are seeing negative mix as the LEAP volume ramps. This has been partially offset by nice improvement in LEAP product cost and at services, like I mentioned, just a very strong spares rate and just strong spare part consumption on our T&M contracts.
Peeling back and looking forward, we do see CFM coming down, but it's more than offset by military being stronger, the LEAP cost curve really coming down over the next few years and the services strength continuing. We expect to see continued healthy growth there, particularly as CFM continues to work its way through the services cycle. So backlog, strong revenue growth, air miles, strong services growth, and LEAP coming down the cost curve is probably the way to think about it.

From Goldman Sachs, we have Joe Ritchie. Please go ahead.

H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. - General Electric Co.

Good morning, Joe.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Hi, Joe.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So just a couple quick clarifications. Jamie, on the net leverage target, I didn't see you guys explicitly call out 2020, but you did mention in the next few years. Has that 2.5 times changed at all from a timing perspective? And then the second question, in just thinking about the comments around GE needing to support Capital beyond the $3 billion in capital infusion in 2019, is the new insurance policy going to make you revisit the $15 billion capital outlay over the next few years?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
So with respect to the first question on the net debt to EBITDA, we intend to reach net debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times. We plan to achieve that over time with substantial progress through 2020. That's really how we're thinking about that right now.
With respect to the – and I assume you're talking about the insurance accounting standard – that is something that, as I said, we expect will have a material impact on the financial statements. Not effective until 2021. It requires more granularity around loss testing. It changes the discount rate assumptions. And we'll evaluate that over the next couple of years, but it does not impact the statutory reserve accounting. And that is really what drives the capital funding requirements for insurance.

Hey, John.
John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Hi, guys. Jamie, what was the Capital stranded debt at the end of the third quarter? And as a follow-up, what would you say is the actual free cash of the businesses that we've committed to selling to try to discern what could be some sort of a normalized cash rate, say once working capital and restructuring balance? So I guess there's rail, ambulance, Distributed Power, Industrial Solutions. Is there any way to put that into a context?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
Yes. We've said before that the free cash flow of the businesses that we're selling is a little over $1 billion, about $1.2 billion in free cash flow. So that's some sizing there. And with respect to excess debt, pay-downs in 2018 will be $7 billion; 2019, we expect that to be about $9 billion and then we've got long-term debt maturities in 2020 in GE Capital of $16 billion and it's really a question there of issuances that might offset that. So that might give you a little bit of sizing there.

Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Yes. Just wondering as you look at GE Capital overall and the GECAS asset, curious if you see net positive value of the GE Capital balance sheet and earnings power here and if we should think of potentially selling GECAS as a silver bullet to shore up what might come with the accounting standard change in insurance and if you will not wait until 2021 to answer that rather than leave it as an overhang?
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
GECAS is a really strong business. Over the years, it's, I think, demonstrated its strength in terms of its risk and its underwriting and how it performs with low loss ratios over time. We think it's really advantaged because of its knowledge of the underlying assets.

And due to that, we receive inbounds on this business all the time. We think it's a valuable franchise. We have not made any decisions or have plans right now to do anything with GECAS, but certainly that's something, as we think about the timing and pace of execution on our overall plan, that is something we could think about.

Are there other plans on the asset sale side within Industrial? There have been some sort of news reports about potential asset sales beyond the ones already announced.
Jamie S. Miller - General Electric Co.
We've got our $20 billion disposition plan in motion. We've executed a number of those already this year. Distributed Power, as I mentioned, is on track to be sold in the fourth quarter. Transportation's on track for the first quarter. We do have a few Aviation businesses and Current and Lighting that we're still well underway in those processes. So those will likely come through as well.
Beyond that, I think it really gets back to Larry's comments on Baker Hughes and Healthcare and a planned, orderly separation over time with Baker Hughes and over time, a separation of Healthcare as well.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Eaton Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the call now to, Mr. Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for today for Eaton's third quarter 2018 earnings call. As all of you that are on the call have noticed, today our call is occurring at 11 AM versus our traditional 10 start. We moved our call today to allow those of you who follow Cummins to participate in their call, which occurred at 10 AM this morning. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.
Our agenda today as typical includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the performance in the third quarter along with our outlook for 2018 and a preliminary look at 2019. As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.
The press release from the earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of this call is going to be available on our website and will be available for replay after the earnings is complete.
Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to forward-looking future results of the company and are therefore by definition forward-looking statements. The actual results can differ from those forecasted projections due to a range of items covered in the uncertainties covered in our press release, presentation and on the 8-K.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Okay. Thanks, Don. Hey, let me begin with a quick summary of our Q3 results. And overall it was a solid quarter where our balance across multiple end markets really allowed the company to deliver strong results and so we're really pleased with our Q3 results.
Earnings per share of $0.95 on a GAAP basis or $1.43 excluding the impact of the arbitration decision we previously announced in August. This is towards the upper end of our guidance range of $1.35 to $1.45 and up 14% above prior year, excluding naturally the gain from the JV that we formed last year in Q3. Our sales were $5.4 billion, up 4%, and this was comprised of 6% organic growth offset by 1% each from both currency and some small divestitures we had during the course of last year.
We're very pleased with our strong margin performance, which included an all-time record margins of 17.6%. Our teams really executed well, which led to all-time record margins in three of our segments including; Electrical Products, Electrical Systems & Services, and Aerospace. And finally, we produced solid operating cash flows of $1 billion in the quarter.

On page 4, we compare our performance of the quarter versus prior year and I'll just highlight a couple of items here. Notice that sales were up 4% and strong execution, segment operating margins were up 120 basis points over prior year and we posted 11% increase in segment operating profits.
We did have two unusual items impacting the year-over-year comparisons, the gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in Q3 2017 and the expenses from the arbitration decision in Q3 2018. Excluding these items, net income was also up 11%.
On page 5, we summarize the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenues were flat with organic growth of 1%, offset by 1% currency. And I'll just note here that revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by the Lighting business. As we discussed in prior calls, in the Lighting business organic revenues declined slightly in the quarter, in line with declines that we've seen in Q2 and excluding Lighting, Electrical Products had 3% organic growth. In the quarter, we saw revenue strength in North America with particular strength and solid growth in the industrial end markets.
We had expected our Lighting sales to turn positive in the quarter and we do believe this will happen next quarter. This assumption is also supported by the growth that we saw in our orders during the course of Q3. Overall orders increased 3% for the segment with solid growth in industrial and residential markets in North America. And our backlog is up some 16% over last year. So we're pleased to see the really strong strength and building backlogs during the course of the quarter. Segment operating profits increased 4%, with operating margins up 70 basis points to once again an all-time record of 19.2%.
On page 6, we outline the results of our Electrical Systems & Services segment. Organic growth was 9% in the quarter, an acceleration from Q2, which was up 7% and Q1 which was up 2%. Foreign exchange and the divestiture of a small joint venture each reduced revenues by 1% in the quarter. We saw strength in industrial markets and data centers and geographically we saw strength in North America and also in the Asia-Pacific region. Bookings were up 4% with strong growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and with data center orders up double-digit globally.
We did see a degree of caution in late September in U.S., especially in large project orders. We've seen this kind of caution in the past on periods of economic uncertainty and so we do think that impacted our orders a bit in the quarter and at the end of the month of September. Notably, our backlog was up 12% versus last year. Operating margins of 15.4% were up 160 basis points and were an all-time record for the segment.
On page 7, we cover our Hydraulics segment. Here revenues were up 6%, 7% organic growth offset by 1% from currency. We had strength with multiple OEMs in both construction and ag markets and also in the distribution channel. Orders increased 4% with geographic strength in Asia and in the Americas, and this is on top of very strong comps from Q3 of 2017 which were up some 22% last year. So we saw end market strength in both construction and also in agriculture – with agriculture OEMs.
Geographically, orders were up 12% in the Americas, up 9% in Asia and down 16% in EMEA. Similar to last quarter, orders in EMEA were down due to largely reduced lead times. Our shorter lead times and better delivery performance continues to reduce the need for customers to place long-dated orders in the Europe market. Our Europe orders for deliveries in the three month period, so those shorter lead-time orders, were actually up again this quarter. We continue to have a strong backlog, which was up 24% from last year, operating profits increased 18% and our margins were 14% and 140 basis point improvement over last year.

Next on page 8, we summarize Aerospace's performance in the quarter. The Aerospace segment accelerated nicely from 6% organic growth in Q2 to 9% growth in Q3. In the quarter we saw strength across many platforms including military fighters, rotorcraft, regional jet, biz jets, and in both military and commercial aftermarket, so really broad-based strength in our Aerospace business. Orders remained strong in the quarter, up 12%, with particular strength in commercial transport, commercial aftermarket, as well as in military rotorcraft.
Our backlog is also up strongly, up some 15% in the quarter. And operating leverage here was really outstanding with profits increasing 25% to an all-time record. Margins of 22% and up some 280 basis points over prior year. In addition to solid execution, I will acknowledge as well that we had favorable mix in the quarter, which positively impacted margins, largely as a result of strength in the commercial aftermarket business which grew faster than the overall segment.
Moving to page 9 in the Vehicle segment, in Q3, our organic growth was 7%, and this organic growth was offset by 3% from FX and 2% from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture last year. The NAFTA Class 8 market continues to perform well. We've increased our production forecast for 2018 from 295,000 units to 320,000 units and this is being offset somewhat by weakness in light vehicle markets in China and a bit in Europe as well. Operating profits increased 11% while operating margin stepped up 140 basis points to 18.9%. Overall, another very strong quarter in our Vehicle business.
And wrapping up our segment summaries, we move to the eMobility segment on page 10. Organic growth was 7%. As anticipated we're ramping up our R&D investment in this business and therefore segment margins stepped down to 12.5%, which is really in line with our full year margin guidance for the segment. In Q3 we secured an additional contract win for a new eMobility program, which reinforces our optimism for this fast-growing market. And we're also currently in discussions with a large number of additional customers and so our long-term growth outlook for this segment remains quite optimistic.
Now moving to page 11. With three quarters behind us and heading into the final quarter of the year, we're fine-tuning our segment expectation for 2018 for both organic revenue growth and for operating margin. Our end markets continue to experience solid growth; we're reaffirming both our full-year organic growth target of 6% and our operating margins of between 16.4% and 17%.
While the overall organic growth expectation remains unchanged, we are adjusting our growth estimates for four of the segments. In Electrical Products, we're adjusting it down by a half a basis point (sic) [half a point] (11:01) from 3% to 2.5%, and this is mostly due to softness in Lighting, which we say – think has extended one quarter longer than what we originally anticipated. But with orders turning positive in Q3, we're really confident that this headwind for the segment has now abated and we expect to see better growth going forward.
We're also reducing Hydraulics down 1% from 13% to 12%. We had previously raised our outlook in Q1 from 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength in orders over the last 18 months, so this change from 12% to 13% we think reflects just some fine-tuning with three quarters behind us now.
We're also raising our revenue outlook in two segments. We're taking Aerospace up 2%, from 6% to 8% for the year, really on broad-based strength in a number of our end markets, and for Vehicle, we're raising our organic growth forecast by 1%, reflecting the increased production levels in NAFTA Class 8 market in 2018, moving it from 295,000 to 320,000 units.

For segment operating margins, we're fine-tuning some of the targets in a number of the segments, but overall, segment margins for Eaton overall remain unchanged. So we think a strong year of conversion.
And just turning to page 12, we've taken an opportunity here to summarize our thoughts around our raw material cost and tariffs. As we outlined in Q2, we expect the tariff impact for 2018 to be modest, and as background, it's important to note that we do manufacture in zone of currency, and as a result, we don't have large material flows that would disproportionally be affected by tariffs. Where we are affected we've been focused on taking both price increases and operational actions to ensure that we stay ahead of this issue and our performance today certainly reflects this in the margin strength that we're delivering in our businesses.
As we look to 2019, we remain confident in our ability to mitigate the latest round of tariff impacts with both pricing actions and other supply chain changes. As we take a look at the latest round of 301 tariffs that have been now finalized, we expect about $110 million of additional tariff cost in 2019 and we are in the midst of taking actions now that will ensure that the tariff related cost increases are once again fully offset by pricing and other additional supply chain changes. And so we're confident as we look forward just as we look backward that we have plans in place to fully mitigate any tariff related cost increases.
And next on the next page, we provide our Q4 guidance, and an updated guidance on the full year. For Q4, we expect EPS of $1.38 to $1.48 and this assumes 6% organic growth, it assumes margins of between 17% and 17.4% and a tax rate of between 12.5% and 13.5%. And as we take a look at the full year for 2018, for the third time this year, we're increasing the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance to a range of $5.30 to $5.40. This naturally excludes the arbitration decision impact. The midpoint of our EPS guidance is increasing 1% from $5.30 to $5.35. We now expect corporate expenses to be $20 million above 2017 levels compared to $10 million that we previously noted and this is largely the result of slightly higher interest expenses.
The tax rate for 2018 is now expected to be between 11% and 12%, reflecting really the impact of the arbitration decisions in Q3 that we noted earlier. And consistent with prior guidance, we're expecting operating cash flows of between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion. This does exclude the $300 million impact from the arbitration decision in Q3, and also unchanged, our free cash flow is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, once again, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision.
Our assumptions for CapEx and restructuring costs are unchanged from prior guidance. However, certainly given the recent pullback in the stock market, we would expect our share repurchases to range from $800 million to $1 billion for the full year and year-to-date our share repurchases have been roughly $600 million. So we'll certainly view this is a buying opportunity given the pullback that we've seen recently.
Lastly, at the midpoint of our EPS guidance, we would expect to generate 2018 EPS growth of roughly 15% excluding the impact of the arbitration decision and the 2017 gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins JV and the income arising from the 2017 tax bill.
Hey, just turning to page 14, and I know this is one of the big questions that's on everybody's mind, during last quarter's earnings call we provided a view of our key end markets and really split by three categories, parts of our businesses that we were basically in the early to mid-part of the growth stage, those that were in the middle part of the growth stage and the late stage of growth. And our conclusion then is still our conclusion today, the majority of our businesses are in the early to mid-part of the economic growth cycle. While we do expect the rate of growth to slow somewhat, given the strong 2018 results. We also anticipate that we'll see solid growth in 2019. This view of our end markets is consistent with our initial outlook for 2019 and our assumption that our end markets will grow between 3% and 4% next year.

And just turning the page 15, while we provide specific guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January – we will provide specific guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January, we thought it would be helpful also to share some high-level assumptions around 2019. As I noted, we think our end markets will grow 3% to 4%. At this point in the cycle we'd expect incremental margins on core growth to be between 25% and 30% and this does include any impact associated with tariffs. And our preliminary estimate on corporate costs, including pension, interest and other corporate, suggests that they'll be flat with 2018. We expect our tax rate to be between 14% and 15%, consistent with our expected long-term tax rate, and lastly we continue to see opportunities for attractive returns and restructuring opportunities and we anticipate restructuring spending for 2019 will be generally in line with 2018.
So with that, I'll turn the meeting back over to Don Bullock and we're happy to answer any questions that you may have.

Before I have the operator provide you with instructions for the Q&A, I did want to note that we do have a number of individuals in the queue for questions today. Given our time constraints of an hour and our desire to get as many of these questions as possible addressed, please limit your questions to a question and a follow-up. Thanks in advance. With that, I'll turn over to the operator to provide you with instructions for the Q&A.

Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our first question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Craig, I was wondering if you could actually address capital deployment a little bit more directly, and what you're thinking. The spirit I'm asking the question is what seems some plausible speculation you guys were poking around at Esterline. I don't expect you to address that specifically, but maybe you could give us some thoughts on what your appetite is for bigger deals and how you might kind of play that card as we look into 2019?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah. Thanks, Jeff, certainly appreciate the question, and as you noted, we don't comment on any potential acquisitions. I would say that our capital deployment strategy is largely unchanged with where we've been. We've said that our first priority in our call on cash is going to be invest in our businesses and to invest in organic growth, and we continue to see really lots of tremendous opportunities to do that.
We'll continue to pay a very healthy dividend and buy back shares, and in this environment, as I noted, we'll certainly be much more aggressive in buying back our shares where we think this is a tremendous buying opportunity, and we'll generate a lot of cash over the next several years, and we have the opportunity to deploy that cash in certainly value-creating acquisitions, and there we've said our priorities continue to be in our Electrical business, in our Aerospace business, and also in our new eMobility segment.
But having said that, what we've said all along as well, we are not going to lose our pricing discipline, that we have a very structured approach to the way we take a look at deals and those opportunities, and we think our cost of capital is 8% to 9%, and we talk about delivering a minimum of 300 basis points over the cost of capital. And so we intend to remain very disciplined as we take a look at opportunities and how we price them, recognizing that we always have an opportunity to go out and buy our stock back and essentially create tremendous shareholder value. So, we will continue to be disciplined as we have been in the past around the way we think about capital deployment.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Right. And by the same token, any other thoughts about just the portfolio overall? I think that probably is something you are always discussing internally, or thinking about internally. Do you think the structure, combined structure still makes sense for Eaton here?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I think in simple terms the answer is yes, we like the structure of the company today, we like the makeup of the company today, but having said that, as we've shared with this group in the past, we are always evaluating and assessing. We have laid out a very specific criteria for what's required to be a part of Eaton and the type of characteristics that businesses need to have and the type of results that they need to deliver, and to the extent that we have businesses that are not measuring up to those requirements, there are specific actions in place to improve.
And obviously they are on the clock, and they have to improve within a certain period of time. And if they don't improve, we'll do what we've done in the past, and we've always been willing to divest parts of the portfolio that don't live up to the company's expectation. And I can assure you that we have a very thorough process with our board where we review all of our businesses, including nonperforming businesses on a regular basis, and so I would tell you that we will continue to be smart and diligent in assuring that the things that are part of the company pass the criteria or have a path to it, or we'll take other action.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Right. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning, Nigel.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah, no one told me about the 10 o'clock, I actually dialed in quite early. So just want to dig in a little deeper on the projects pause, I think you called out, specifically within ESS, and I'm just wondering what are you hearing from customers here? Is this more inflation and having to back to the drawing board to reassess project returns? Is it just uncertainty around the macro? Any color there would be helpful. And any end market color in terms of where the project delays are coming from?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, what I see, Nigel, we did see it, as I mentioned, largely in large projects in the month of September, in the Americas primarily, and it was – certainly caught us by a little bit – by surprise as well, but I do think it's just simply the environment that we're in right now which is filled with lots of uncertainty, whether it's geopolitical issues, or it's the elections or it's tariffs, quite surprisingly, we were clocking along just fine and were surprised in the month of September, but we do think that it's a temporary pause, and if you take a look at the macro data, whether it's the C30 data or you take a look at some of the key end markets that we serve, there's nothing that would suggest that the fundamentals are not still very much intact. And so we'll have to see what Q4 brings, but at this point, there's nothing that would suggest that the underlying strength that we anticipated to see in our Electrical Systems & Services business would abate at this point.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then just on China, obviously there's a lot of push and pull going on in China with – obviously, we're seeing a slowdown in the data, the stimulus measures coming through. Feels like the construction markets are pretty healthy over there. Obviously you play quite strongly into the construction markets, but any comment in terms of what you're seeing in China would be helpful.

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I think, without a doubt we definitely saw a slowdown in China during the course of Q3. Principally, we saw that slowdown in vehicle markets which I think have been largely widely reported and we saw that slowdown as well, although we did deliver solid growth ourself in China in Q3 based upon a number of new wins.
And so I do think that as we think about the project business or commercial construction in China, at this point, we think that market continues to be fine. There's nothing that we're seeing in the overall economy that would suggest a significant pullback, although, clearly, there's some uncertainty in the China market as well.
I think the tariff impact and the uncertainty that that's creating, I just – I spent about a week in China myself a couple weeks ago, had an opportunity to meet with a lot of our customers and CEOs of local Chinese companies, and they, too, are feeling this period of uncertainty and I do think there's a little bit of a pause taking place in that market, as well, pending our elections and the ultimate resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Thanks, Rick.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So maybe just following up on that question on just the large project pause in North America, I guess I'm just trying to understand, did you guys have a sense that these projects were going to be awarded in September and then the customers decided to pause on the decision? Or was this more of like just a gap in the market from the strength that you'd been seeing in the most previous quarters?
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Joe, I'll take that one. It really was the former. We had expected contracts to be signed by the end of September and due to the uncertainties that Craig talked about, there are various customers that delayed committing to projects. We think it's temporary. These are projects that are quite far along, so it's not likely that they won't go forward, but it seemed to be that phenomenon, really, just in the last two weeks of September.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
And I'd say that that position is really buttressed a little bit by the fact that if you take a look at our backlog in both our Electrical Systems & Services business, as well as in our Electrical Products business, the both of them were up quite strongly in the quarter, up 12% in Electrical Systems & Services and up 16% in Electrical Products. And so I think that that thesis is really borne out by the increase in our backlog.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And perhaps my follow-on question, Craig, you mentioned earlier just initial thoughts into 2019 on the contribution margin of 25% to 30%, so that includes the tariff related impact. I'm just wondering, how much are you anticipating to get back of the $110 million in tariffs? And then, also, if you think about just like cadence from a pricing perspective, like how are you guys thinking about that as you progress through 2019?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I'd say that – once again, appreciate the question. The 25% to 30% does include the impact of tariffs and while we fully expect to recover all $110 million of the tariff related cost increases, what's obviously problematic is trying to get an incremental on top of a tariff.
And so the incrementals that we're talking about for 2019 are somewhat muted as a result of what we think will be an inability to get an incremental margin on a tariff related cost increase, but we certainly expect to fully recover those costs and we expect to be out in front of it and ensure that as we go through the quarter, that the tariff related cost increases are not a headwind to margins.

Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Understood. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey. So just a couple questions here, truck, big revision here. Is that being driven by the supply chain improving there, any kind of color?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I'd say, one, Jeff, absolutely. There were some supply chain constraints that we experienced early in the year and there was some concern that we and others had about the industry's ability to actually deliver against the underlying demand that was in the marketplace. And certainly, those constraints have been largely eliminated during the course of the year. And so that's certainly part of what drove us to revise our forecast up, as well as the market has just continued to be very robust. And I'd say the really good news even about some of the order intake that we continue to see in the North America Class 8 market, is that in all likelihood, all of these orders are not going to be delivered during the course of 2018 and they'll spill off into 2019. And so we think 2019 will be another growth year for North America Class 8 on top of a very strong year in 2018.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then data center, I think you cited as been strong, certainly it's been red hot in 2018. If you just look at backlog and quoting activity, what does that suggest for that data center market into 2019?
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, right now we enter, we will enter 2019 with a pretty decent backlog and certainly there are continued discussions for some large orders next year. So we would expect 2019 would be another robust year. Right now it's a little bit hard to say will it be as robust as 2018, 2018 after all did step up dramatically, but it should be another strong year.
Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning, Nicole.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. So just I don't want to harp too much on this ESS order issue but just had one more point to clarify. I guess when you think about the customer conversations that you're having and the fact that they're kind of pushing out signing contracts, is there any visibility at all on how long they're pushing out? Like is this oh, we'll delay until 4Q because we want to get this into our CapEx year? Or are these contracts more likely to be signed in 2019 once we get past this next stage of tariffs?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I think it's really difficult to say precisely, Nicole, how much of a delay we're talking about, but with these projects in general you can't delay them for that long, right? I mean, as they're tied to other underlying requirements for facilities and buildings. And so we don't anticipate that this is going to be a long delay and we would hope to see in the course of this year in the fourth quarter and certainly by time we get to Q1, that this thing rights itself.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Craig. And then second question just around Hydraulics margins, you guys had to take down guidance again. I guess what's going on there? Maybe a little bit more color and is this just a structurally less profitable business than you thought? Or is this just really attributed to price cost and other issues that are more transitory? And I guess, does Hydraulics have a place in Eaton's portfolio given what we've seen with the margin performance year-to-date?

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Sure. First of all, I'd say we too are disappointed in the fact that we've got to take margins down again in Hydraulics, but I'd say the underlying margin issue in Hydraulics is largely a function of supply chain and operational inefficiencies that we're experiencing throughout the system. They're not structural, they're absolutely fixable but we have continued to struggle with the ability to work through supply chain, we're spending a lot more than we anticipated in premium freight and expedite and overtime as the industry has ramped up and our ability, and quite frankly our suppliers' ability to deal with this ramp in orders and sales.
And so I'd say structurally speaking, nothing has changed, but having said that, as I've said with all of our businesses, Hydraulics is on the clock. And there are certain things that we have to do to demonstrate that the Hydraulics business can be a consistent performer in the company in terms of underlying margins and underlying growth rate and reduced cyclicality. And so all of the criteria that we've laid out for every part of the company also applies to Hydraulics and they have some work to do to demonstrate that we can create the kind of business that we want to own long term inside of Eaton.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
But structurally speaking, no concerns. And they're operational issues that we have to work out with our supply base. But the business remains largely on target.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks, Craig.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with UBS.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Hey, thanks, and good morning.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Just on the 2019 overall market growth of 3% to 4% that you're calling out, are you still thinking about your own outgrowth of that generally and kind of the one and a half times or two times? Or how are you guys thinking about your own performance relative to that?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I think at this point, Steve, we're still in the midst of doing our own planning internally, but you have the thesis right. The 3% to 4% is market and we would anticipate our businesses growing in excess of market. And so as we get through our own internal profit planning for 2019 and we provide guidance in January, we'll give you a sense for what we think the overall growth rate of the company will be. But it will be something on top of market growth.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on your comments on that delay that you talked about so much on the call. The order delays around ESS, are those projects that are already in the backlog that you saw the risk or just new? And if they are already in the backlog, are you – can you think about sort of this is 12 to 18-month projects; I assume these are sort of shorter term ones?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
No, I would put – these are really largely in the category of negotiations that did not result in an order, so, therefore, are not in the backlog.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So, therefore, you're not seeing or calling out any incremental risk to what's already in the backlog?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Absolutely not.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC
All right. Thanks, I'll pass it on.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Yes. Good morning. I just want to go back if we can, to your 2019 tariff comments. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on which segments might be impacted more than others? And I'm also wondering if Section 301 essentially gets taken all the way, what would be the incremental impact, if you know it, or you had a to calculate it versus what you've got in the pipe today?

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Sure. I'd say – first of all, I'd say that, to answer maybe to your last question first. Most of the stuff that we do in terms of trade between China and the U.S. has already been captured in the current proposed wave of tariffs. And so if they ended up tariffing 100% of what came out of China into the U.S. it would have an immaterial impact on our company. So most of it's been captured in what's already been announced. And in the context of what's already been announced by segment, I'd say most of it will largely be in our Electrical segments. We had some earlier – some of the earlier stuff caught our industrial businesses. And this last wave, most of that will be in the Electrical sector. But we will have some smattering of impacts across the other businesses as well.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
I see. That's helpful. And again, looking at 2019 incremental margin comments, 25% to 30%, based on what you just said about tariff impact, is there a way to maybe rank the various segments in terms of where you see opportunity for incremental margins? What's above-average? What would be below average? How do you think about it?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, we certainly appreciate the question, and I'd just say this once again, it's a little bit early for us to provide that level of detailed guidance, as we've not worked through our own internal profit plans. And so perhaps in January we can provide you a bit more insight. But for right now I think if you use 25% to 30% for the overall company, it should help you at least do some preliminary modeling.
Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
All right. Thanks.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Good morning, Josh.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just to maybe dig on EP here, I know you guys have talked at length in the past about an implicit attachment rate between EP and ESS. Craig, you mentioned in some of your opening remarks that the industrial side of EP was doing a little bit better. So I would assume that attachment rate is still holding, but when I think about the deceleration in the quarter, Lighting was cited as a bit of an issue. And I would imagine in 2Q that was an issue as well. So I'm just trying to figure out what inside of EP feels different sequentially, understanding that maybe Lighting isn't moving around as much.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, let me take a stab at it. I would say the fundamentals of the business, let's take Lighting out, that's a separate set of issues. The fundamentals feel not very different than in Q2. The tone of the market, the momentum. What we did see, though, right towards the end of September, is we did see a similar slowing in some of our flow goods in various parts of the business and I would attribute it to the same kind of caution that we saw in ESS, in the orders in ESS. It's just that in a flow good type business, you tend to see it in sales because it just – it's an immediate impact as opposed to simply an order being placed.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then just to go back to the outgrowth question that was asked earlier on 2019, could you maybe frame up how you think about the 6% for 2018 and what that represents of outgrowth versus markets just so we can kind of level set how that has trended?
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
I can take a stab at it. I mean, it's really hard.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Don't stab too much, it's close to Halloween, Rick.

Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, yeah.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Right.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
The way I would think about it – first of all, the way I would think about the general growth in our revenues, 2018 was a year of growth in many of our markets. It was probably above trend and what you're seeing in 2019 is you're coming back towards a more trend-like rate of growth. And our outgrowth in 2018, it's hard to know your markets, particularly in this tumultuous time very exactly, but at 6% organic growth, we're probably a point or so, maybe a little more than a point, of outgrowth.
And so if you think about 2019, you could take the 3% to 4% and add something, a point to a point and a half, maybe, roughly, outgrowth and get some kind of rough estimate of what kind of organic revenue growth we're likely to have. It'll be a little less in 2019 than in 2018, but that's to be expected, you come back to a more trend like market growth.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I think you just answered the question, Rick, that I said I wasn't going to answer.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Sorry about that.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Appreciate the color.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question is from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. I was hoping to pile on just a little bit on your thinking around 2019 and when you see overall market growth of 3% to 4%, it feels like half to three-quarters of that's probably available in terms of pricing, which would imply a fairly low growth rate on sort of a unit level. And I'm curious sort of how you think about that.
And then the follow-on would be on incremental margin. I guess I would have assumed that 25% to 30% is a good base level, but you would have had some sort of restructuring benefit on top of that. And so, recognizing you probably don't want to put numbers around that, just sort of how do we think about that qualitatively?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Inventories in the market.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yes. There is a holding number for price in our 2019 market outlook, but it's really preliminary and I wouldn't read too much into that. Does the 3% to 4% need ultimately, to be adjusted for price? Maybe, but it's just too early to have a good feel for that.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
And the incremental margin?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I'd say the way I would think about the incremental margins is that – keep in mind that a lot of the restructuring stuff that we've done, really, we got a lot of those benefits in 2018 and we'll be spending more – a similar level of restructuring expenses in 2019.
And so I think you saw the pop in incremental margins in 2018, but as you think about just the timing of programs and expense versus benefits, as you take on more and more programs, the profile of cost versus benefit changes. And so I'd say that the 25% to 30% is a good number to use right now and the restructuring programs will have good paybacks, but the – as you look at every incremental program, the length and the payback pushes out a little bit.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
I think it's fair to say we have not yet gone through the detailed restructuring initiatives for next year. So until we do that, we can't be really precise about the benefits next year from those programs.
Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC
Fair enough. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Good morning.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Just a question on taxes. Given where taxes ended up for this year, why do we think the tax rate will go up next year, particularly as you're working to reduce it longer-term?

Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Well, there – 2018 is still a transitional year with some changes in the regulations associated with the tax bill. And so we, as we look at those changes including a step-up in the rate of the BEAT tax next year, we believe that the tax rate will naturally move a bit higher.
Now 11% to 12% we say is the overall rate, but mind you, that rate's a little lower than it would be because of the Pepsi arbitration. That was a U.S. expense, and of course a U.S. expense pulls with it the U.S. relatively higher tax rate than the rest of the world, and so that pulls the overall rate down. If you look at the rate without that Pepsi expense, the rate is going to be higher by something on the order of a point to a point and a half. And so the difference isn't as great as it seems.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got you. And then another question. How should we think – you guys sort of broke out eMobility. And how volatile should we expect this segment to be, both in terms of profitability and top line?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I'd say that we can expect a fair amount of volatility in this business. Largely, if you think about the top line, is programs and program wins will naturally be lumpy, and they come in very large chunks when you win a program. So I think from a standpoint of the revenue growth – and once again, the revenue growth we're still saying is going to be out a couple years or so. But it will naturally be lumpy, just by virtue of the type of business and the growth phase that we're in, in this particular industry. And we will continue to invest heavily in R&D. I mean, we talked about the underlying profitability being, order of magnitude 12% as we continue to invest heavily in R&D. As we win programs, each of those will require a level of R&D investment, and so I think you can expect a fair amount of lumpiness in the segment as we move forward.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Morning, Deane.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Craig, was hoping you could expand on your comments regarding that you thought most of your businesses were still in the early to mid-stage of the cycle. So what are you basing that on? Are there some bellwether verticals that give you good indications of that as to the size of projects? But some color there for starters, would be helpful.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, I mean, and once again, everybody has their own kind of sense of forecasting, but one of the things we certainly look at in our largest segment, we look at the census data and we looked at consensus forecasts. And when you take a look at consensus forecasts, whether it's Dodge or IHS or Moody's or Associated Builders and Contractors, and we have an economic forecast. And there's also a number of economic forecasters and prognosticators who basically have a view of what 2019 is going to look like. And I'd say, their consensus numbers would suggest that 2019 will look not terribly different from 2018. A little bit of moderation in growth on average or looking at the median, but you're still talking about growth in the 3% to 4% range when you look at this consensus body of forecasters.
And when you – if you talk to customers, you look at negotiations, you take a look at where we are in the economic cycle versus our historical cycles. You put all these factors together. We take a look at an aerospace business that continue to do extremely well on commercial with a big backlog. You look at increased defense spending. You look at the type of orders that we're experiencing today in our North America Class 8 truck business and the type of – kind of backlog that they'll carry into 2019. So we think it's really only the vehicle markets around the world that have shown clear evidence of sales retrenchment. And most of the other markets that we serve, whether we're looking at the current view or the outlook for our markets would suggest that we continue to see growth.

And even for us, if you think about some of the headwinds that we've experienced this year in the context of even Lighting, we don't expect those headwinds to necessarily be there next year. And so once again, we think it's the forecast that we laid out, that our markets will grow 3% to 4% next year, is supported by all the economic data that we take a look at and supported by what we're hearing and seeing from customers as well.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
I appreciate all that color. And then just follow-up on the free cash flow question, was there any sort of prebuying done? We talked about this last quarter, but pre-buying ahead of the tariffs, and maybe also for what you all may have done in terms of inventory building. But anything unique or an impact on the quarter that we would see?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I would say for sure we did, as I think we talked about a little bit last quarter, we did some pre-buying in terms of inventory to get out in front of the tariffs and protect our customers, and so we did build a little bit of inventory during the course of Q3 that we'd expect to unwind in Q4, and as we go forward. But nothing that I would say is material. Our cash flow numbers in the quarter, $1 billion dollars of free cash flow, and we are maintaining our guidance for the year, and so everything that we've done, we expect to largely unwind it during the course of the year.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yes, one way to think about it, Deane, is that if you look at simple way of thinking about amounts of working capital. So receivables inventory less payables divided by annualized sales were at about 21.5%, and most of the time we've operated more like 19%. So there is an opportunity to bring that down, it's largely in the inventory area because of some of the need to take positions to deal with the tariff issues. We have not yet done that, but certainly we have plans to take down this inventory back to more normal levels. We hope to make some of that progress in Q4 and some will probably extend into the first quarter of next year.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's real helpful. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
The next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning, everybody.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Hi.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Wanted to dig into the pause you discussed in some the Electrical markets and look into another vertical, Hydraulics. Did you see any similar pause in that business, specifically in energy and mining?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I'd say in Hydraulics, no, we really did not see any particular pause in energy and mining and one of the great proxies for what's going on for example in mining, you see the Cat data that's out there, which was, once again, very strong in Q3, and so material prices, the commodity prices are up, that's generally a very good thing for mining overall, very good for the equipment manufacturers. So no, we really did not see any pause in that market at all. China is a big piece of construction equipment and in China in Q3 we continue to see very strong numbers in excavator sales and wheel loaders, and so no, we have not seen a pause in those markets.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you, Craig. And then separately, Eaton's historically had a really good feel for the NAFTA Class 8 truck market. And we're seeing customers having to wait a real long time for truck deliveries. Are you guys seeing any sign of double ordering within that backlog?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
No, I think at this point we'd say no, we've seen no evidence of that. The market is good right now and obviously rates are up, capacity is up, and we are actually in a replacement cycle based upon trucks that were basically sold, and it peaks eight, nine years ago. And so right now, I'd tell you it all feels good, Andy, and that market as you know, it's subject to be volatile, but everything that we're hearing today from customers and seeing in the market would suggest that no double ordering, and 2019 will be another growth year on top of an extraordinary year in 2018.

Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you very much.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
The next question comes from and Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered by now. But maybe you could expand on the project win you talked about in eMobility, where is it, what is it, what's the timeline, just some color on that would be great?
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Yeah, it was largely, I'd say, Ann, if it was a win in the commercial vehicle segment, and it was a relatively modest win in that particular business. And so I'd say today, not one that's big enough for us to make a lot of noise over at this point, we are still bidding on a number of very interesting opportunities in eMobility, but I'd say that one was largely in commercial vehicles with some of our existing customers, and really not one that I'd say that's worthy of a lot of discussion at this point.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then as a follow up, I think when I was with you earlier in the quarter and European construction was showing some signs of weakness, and yet on page 14 it's listed as mid-growth stage. I would think that that's one end market that may be at the later growth stage just given how long that market has expanded. Could you just discuss that a little bit?
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
We actually, a quarter or two ago would have said it was not yet into even mid, it was sort of late early stage and we think it's moved into the mid stage. But barring political issues in Europe, we think you'll have another year or two of reasonable growth in European construction, Ann. So that's our thinking as to why it's in the mid stage.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And any regional color, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Germany versus other regions? I'm just trying to get a sense of where you're seeing the growth. Thank you.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
I have to say, Ann, that I can't give you that off the top of my head but certainly Don can follow up with you on that.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, okay. No problem. And then the only other segment that I think I would disagree with is ag equipment, but we can talk about that offline also given the Chinese tariffs. I'll leave it there for now. Thank you.
Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc
Okay. Thanks, Ann.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
We're probably going to have time for one last question as we want to wrap up on the hour. So we've got John Walsh with Credit Suisse.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse
Hi, thank you for fitting me in here.
Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
Great.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse
So just going back to the initial thoughts on 2019 and as we think about pension and where rates are and I think there's a little bit of a refi benefit potentially in 2019, is there something in corporate to call out? Or is it just it's early days and flat's just the appropriate way to think about it today?
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
I'd say first of all, it is early, and we think it will broadly be flat. But secondly, you do have short interest rates rising and we, like other most large corporates have roughly half of our debt swapped into floating. And so as the short rates rise, our interest costs go up. And so it's really those two factors. As a general matter, it'll be pretty flat, but secondarily, we do know at least of one factor that's likely to increase expenses slightly.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse
Okay. And then I guess thinking about data center and what the growth looks like from here is there any discernible mix benefit or headwind to call out as we kind of see the shift to colo and edge over hyper and what that impact is to Eaton?

Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc
I'd say not. I'd say that we have a very strong position as a company in hyperscale, and that is the fast-growing segment of the market. And so I think if anything, the advantage goes to Eaton as you look at these larger, more complex hyperscale data centers.
John Walsh - Credit Suisse
Okay. Thank you.
Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc
With that, we'll wrap up the call for the day. I do want to remember that we will be available for follow up for the remainder of the day and in the days and weeks following this. Thank you all for joining us on the call today.

Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo’s Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today’s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.
Jamie Caulfield
Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s Chairman and CEO and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s CFO. We'll lead off today’s call with a review of our third quarter performance and full year 2018 outlook and then we'll move on to Q&A.
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information.
Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today’s earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
When discussing our financial results on today’s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items, such as the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other tax related items, foreign exchange translation and acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other changes from our reported results. You should refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning’s earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo’s website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.
Now, it’s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra Nooyi
Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us. As most of you know, we announced in August that I'm stepping down as CEO of PepsiCo after 12 years in the role effective tomorrow. And so today will be my final conference call with you. Actually my 75th and final, if you also include the calls I've participated in as CFO.
After we complete the primary business at hand, reviewing the results and outlook and taking your questions. I'd like to ask for your patience and allow me to make a few concluding remarks at the end of the call.
So, moving on to business; for the quarter we generated $16.5 billion of net revenue driven by 4.9% organic revenue growth and delivered core earnings per share of $1.59, a 9% increase on a core constant currency basis. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the quarter.
The organic revenue growth represents another quarter of sequential acceleration and the highest rate of organic revenue growth in 12 quarters. The majority of our businesses again perform well, but particularly strong performances by our international sectors and solid performance by Frito-Lay in North America.
And while North American beverages profit performance was impacted by inflation and a double-digit increase in advertising expense, the sector posted 2.5% organic revenue growth with a good balance between volume growth and net price realization.

Frito-Lay North America delivered balanced volume growth and net price realization driving by strong innovation and brand marketing. For example, in June we launched Stacy's Cheese Petites inspired by French Cheese Puff, these bite-sized cheese snacks have real cheese baked inside creating a sophisticated snacking experience.
In fact cheese is the primary ingredient. Petites are a good source of calcium and have six grams of protein per serving, and they come in a resealable pouch making them great for a convenient on-the-go experience.
Over the summer, Doritos and Mountain Dew partnered on our Worlds Collide program to appeal to our Gen Z consumers who thrive on accelerating experiences. The program highlighted the brands recent innovations, Doritos Blaze and Dew Ice and rewarded consumers to purchase both products with merchandise and experiences.
The eight-week media campaigns supporting the program span social media channels that are also featured on Pandora to reach our consumers' distinctive music. Tostitos' growth was fueled by new products such as Roasted Red Pepper and Black Bean and Garlic.
To support the product launches we created the program to drive trial during the summer get-togethers. Our Buy, Ride, Get Together already program allowed consumers to scan a code of specially marked bags to redeem a $5 lift credit making it even easier for our consumers to get safety to and from summer parties. And Cheetos benefited from the launch of Cheetos Flaming Hot Chipotle Ranch earlier this year, appealing to consumers growing desire for intense flavors.
Cheetos further benefited from our Cheetos Museum Win What You See campaign, with our first-ever Cheetos promotion supported by TV commercials directing consumers to winwhatyousee.com where we invited our fans to find and submit unique Cheetos shapes to have a chance to win what they see. We garnered more than 80,000 submissions and the program is now been localized and rolled across seven additional countries and counting.
Turning to North American beverages, while the marketplace remains highly competitive, we are encouraged by improving overall category growth trends and a generally rational pricing environment.
We had another quarter of sequential organic revenue performance and improvement. Organic revenue growth of 2.5% is the best you've seen in NAB in eight quarters and was driven by retail sales growth in Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee, Lipton ready-to-drink tea, Gatorade, our water portfolio, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.
Certainly strong innovation across the portfolio is contributing to the improving performance. For example, LIFEWTR continues its journey advancing and showcasing sources of creativity with the launch of our Series 6 Bottle themed diversity and design.
LIFEWTR achieved more than $150 million in measured retail sales in 2017 which was its introductory year. And is on pace to achieve more $200 million in measured retail sales in 2018.
Bubly, a new flavored sparkling water where there's no artificial flavors, colors or calories which we launched in February of this year continues to perform exceeding well and has projected to exceed a $100 million in measured retail sales in this first year.
Mountain Dew's performance is benefiting from the launch of Mountain Dev Ice, another launch which should surpass a $100 million of retail in its first year from launch, and from the return of Mountain Dew Baja Blast as our summer limited time offering.
And in June, we launched Gatorade Zero. With zero sugar and all the electrolytes of Gatorade Thirst Quencher, Gatorade Zero is providing hydration options for more athletes in more occasions and is off to a strong start.
And we believe our stepped-up advertising and marketing, particularly on trademarks Pepsi and Mountain Dew, are also starting to contribute to improve performance as we saw sequential net revenue accelerations in both trademarks in the third quarter.

Commodity inflation, operating cost inflation particularly in transportation cost, product mix and stepped-up advertising expense each pressured our profit performance in the quarter. However, we expect that our recently implemented pricing actions will improve profit performance in the coming quarters.
At Quaker Foods North America, our hot cereal business posted its fifth consecutive quarter of market share gains supported by our marketing campaigns highlighting the functional benefits of oatmeal and innovation like Simple and Wholesome Organic Hot Cereal, a Multigrain Hot Cereal with no artificial colors or preservatives.
In addition, Quaker light snacks gains market share with high singe digit retail sales growth. In our Aunt Jemima pancake business, grew retail sales for the eighth consecutive quarter.
And to close out our conversation in North America, we are pleased to report that in the third quarter PepsiCo was the largest contributor to food and beverage growth at retail in the United States.
Turning to our sectors outside of North America, we are extremely pleased with the 10% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging market as a group, which is the continuation of the strength and experience across many of these markets in the first half.
Strong marketplace execution led to continued solid growth across many of our key international markets. Within Latin America organic revenue grew 10% driven by high single digit growth in Mexico and double-digit growth in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.
The LatAm team is doing an excellent job, building our business and growing our market share in key countries in the region. In our Europe sub-Saharan Africa sector, Russia and South Africa each grew organic revenue high single-digit, while Turkey and Poland had double-digit organic revenue growth. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw mid single-digit organic revenue growth in the UK and France. Again, continued good performance from this team.
And in AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Saudi Arabia, India and Egypt, and high single-digit organic revenue growth in Australia. Excellent results from our AMENA team. This strong top line performance translated into impressive bottom line results with core constant currency operating profit up 12% in our international divisions as a group.
The international results reflect our initiatives to continue to expand distribution of our big global brand and to innovate in locally relevant ways. For example, we continue to drive international growth of our zero sugar Pepsi Black and Pepsi Max trademarks with introductions of lime and cherry flavors across Easter Europe, lime in the Nordics, and lime and vanilla flavors in the Philippines.
We are driving growth in Doritos internationally, whether through expansion to new markets like China where the brand just celebrated its first anniversary since launch, to innovation in existing markets like India, where we launched Doritos Heat Wave.
And the Quaker's trademark continues its global expansion. From the launch of Quaker's super food in Mexico, to our launches of Quaker Kids and Quaker multigrain instant oatmeal platforms in China.
Finally, during the quarter we reach an agreement to acquire SodaStream. As we said on the day of the initial announcement, we believe PepsiCo and SodaStream are an inspired match.
Daniel Birnbaum and the rest of the SodaSteam team have built an extraordinary company that is offering consumers the ability to make great tasting beverages while reducing the amount of waste generated.
That focus is well aligned with performance with Purpose, our philosophy of making more nutritious products while limiting our environmental footprint. Together, we can advance our shared vision of a healthier, more sustainable planet. SodaStream will also add to our growing water portfolio while accelerating our ability to offer personalized in-home beverage solutions around the world.

From breakthrough innovations like Drinkfinity to beverage dispensers like Spire for foodservice and Aquafina water stations for colleges and universities. We are finding new ways to reach consumers beyond the bottle and the SodaStream is fully in line with that strategy.
As we previously announced the acquisition was unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. The transaction is subject to a SodaStream shareholder vote, certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and consummation of the transaction is expected by January of 2019.
Net, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across many of our international markets. In North America, Frito-Lay continues to perform well, North American beverages is making steady improvement, and our recently implemented pricing actions will help improve profit performance in North America. And finally, we are excited about the new opportunities that the pending SodaStream acquisition represents.
With that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston.
Hugh Johnston
Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. I'll jut provide a quick update on the outlook and then we'll move to your questions. After considering our year to-date performance and other factors we've updated our guidance for 2018.
Specifically, we now expect at least 3% organic revenue growth for the full year. We now expect our core effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. We continue to expect core constant currency EPS growth of 9%.
However, we now expect core earnings per share in U.S. dollar terms of $5.65, which reflects a one-point headwind from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus rates due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This is an 8% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23.
We continue to expect strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital allocation with prudent reinvestment into the business. For 2018 we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter. And we now expect net capital spending of approximately $3.3 billion.
We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion reflecting a 15% increase in the annualized dividend per share that began with the June payment and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following items to consider for the fourth quarter. Frito-Lay North America is lapping 5% organic revenue growth from the fourth quarter of 2017.
We expect operating profit to decline in our AMENA division as we lap strong results and a refranchising gain in Jordan from the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect the previously announced refranchising of our Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia business operations to benefit ESSA operating profit in the fourth quarter.
And finally based on market consensus forecast, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both net revenue and operating profit by approximately three percentage points in the fourth quarter.
With that, operator, we are ready to take the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Indra Nooyi
Good morning, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian
Hey, good morning. Congratulations Indra, on an illustrious career of Pepsi and best wishes for you in the future.
Indra Nooyi
Thank you.
Dara Mohsenian
So, the quarter itself clearly saw a large acceleration of the organic sales in emerging and developing markets that's in contrast to some of the fears out there over slowing macro. So, I was just hoping you could give us some more detail there on what drove the sequential improvement? Do you think it's more category growth accelerating or Pepsi market share picking up, maybe some of the key countries behind that. And then most importantly, just are those drivers sustainable as you look going forward beyond Q3 as you think about the strength in the business in the quarter?

Indra Nooyi
Hugh.
Hugh Johnston
Yes. So from an international perspective, I think we saw remarkably broad-based results. The list of countries that had a strong quarter is probably too long to enumerate on the call. We'll use up our entire time doing that. Maybe most notably I think if we saw a strong volume growth both in snacks and in beverages. Snacks were somewhere between 4% and 5% volume growth, beverages between 3% and 4%. And I think it really does sort of demonstrate that both the power of the portfolio and then in addition to that the relatively broad-based strength of economic performance around the world.
So, I think we do expect international to continue to perform very well. I think the portfolio was sturdy and well insulated. Look, at any given time as countries are disrupted, we always have some exposure to those disruptions. But by and large I think we have a remarkably powerful international business.
Indra Nooyi
And our execution also picked up quite a bit.
Hugh Johnston
Yes, absolutely.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
Indra Nooyi
Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Grundy
Good morning, Indra. And I want to extend my congratulations as well. Can we start on the North American beverage business? Results improving. So congratulations on that. But coming at costs when we look at the margin pressure year-over-year and understanding the freight and commodities are playing apart, but you're also picking up your advertising and marketing spending. So maybe you could touch on the ROI on the spent if you're satisfied at this point?
And then two, maybe touch on the necessity to maintain higher levels here into Q4 and even next year particularly behind CSDs and sports drinks as we look at the some of the market share trends we see in the Nielsen data in order to maintain this level of growth? Thank you.
Hugh Johnston
Hey Kevin, it's Hugh Johnston. Couple of things on that. You're right. The P&L was negatively impacted by two things. Number one was cost pressure both transport cost and aluminum were up. Number two, it was the increased in advertising and marketing spend across a number of our businesses. Maybe just we'll step back a little bit in terms of the way that we think about advertising and spending levels. Our intention generally speaking is to be competitive on advertising and spending levels, but not to accelerate beyond competition.
Our goal is to win based on the quality of our advertising and the execution that follows that advertising rather than that the level itself. So I think we will maintain levels of spending that are competitive, but not beyond competitive. Regarding the input cost inflation whether it's transport or whether it's aluminum, our history is always been to price through inflation in our developed markets. We'll look to do that here. We did that post Q3. It's fairly unusual to take pricing in the middle of the summer. So despite the fact that we felt some of that pressure in the summer, we didn't take pricing until September. I think you'll see the profit picture improve in Q4 as a result of that pricing.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Bryan Spillane
Hey, good morning everyone, and Indra, really just want to wish you the best going forward. It's been a pleasure the last 20 years covering you.
Indra Nooyi
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Bryan Spillane
I guess the bigger question I would have is just -- you're looking at the business today in this year, right? We've seen some an increase in investment for advertising and marketing. We've also seen SodaStream as a relative to some the acquisitions you've done in the past a little bit bigger, which Soda suggests that there's just more of a need to sort of invest to continue to drive the top line.

So I [Indiscernible] yes, Indra, if you could if you could just sort of address this. We are at a point now where there is just a need to spend more whether it's operating expense or M&A to sort of drive the top line or was this year sort of more of an anomaly?
Hugh Johnston
Hey, Bryan, it's Hugh. Those are too fairly points, so let me address them separately. In terms of capital allocation broadly no change in policy here. We talked about $500 million here in tuck-ins that continues to be our stated policy. SodaStream in a lot of ways is a unique asset in that it gets into a completely different market that we really weren’t touching at all, which are consumers who preferred to prepare beverages at home, whether they be just sparkling water, whether they be flavored beverages. So I would view [Indiscernible] to increase in advertising and marketing in the beverage business as anything more than a response to competitive increase and that’s a competitive increase that remains to be seen as to where it goes in the future. I think our expectation as we said before is we want to compete on execution, we want to compete on the quality of innovation that we want to compete on the quality of our marketing and we think we are well positioned to do that particularly whether integrated system.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
Ali Dibadj
Hey guys, first Indra very start -- if you go, you’ve really transformed the company and frankly the whole industry, so we feel very good about that, so would love to hear what made you decide to go after 12 great years and maybe that will be in the closing remarks but would love to hear that at or now or later. And then more specifically about the quarter, clearly the topline has been very good, the margins have seen little bit of pressure and we understand about the advertising increases as well as some of the commodity and other costs that are in there, but historically you’ve been able to insulate a lot of that through the $1billion or year of cost savings plan that we’ve seen here, where do you think you are on that, are you towards the end of that and that’s why we are seeing a little more pressure on the margins or do you think that has led to continue for many more years and to insulate you guys from what we are seeing from this quarter and most recent quarters on margin pressure? Thanks.
Hugh Johnston
Ali, well I’ll handle your second question first. In terms of productivity going forward, the bucket which we drive productivity, we call operating expenses about $28 billion bucket. It’s got a natural rate of inflation of about 3% to 4% partly because the bucket is more tilted internationally where inflation rates are higher. So I do think we’ve got years and years of productivity to come into the future. I’m not here to announce a specific new program right now beyond what we’ve announced, but I do think we have lots of opportunity out there for further productivity.
Regarding your question on whether we can continue to drive growth through the P&L funded by productivity. I think broadly the answer to that is yes, in a lot of ways I think that the third quarter was reflective of the timing of our pricing decisions where we decided to take those post Q3 rather than during the quarter which obviously pressured margins a little bit, and it was also reflective of continued investments that we are making in top line growth initiatives, whether it’s advertising and marketing which was up about 6% in the quarter, R&D spending was up about 22% in the quarter, e-commerce spending was roughly double in the quarter.
So I think in many ways what you saw was a timing issue in terms of the timing of commodity increases versus the pricing increase and continued investment in the business while delivering the short-term performance that frankly in many ways has been emblematic [ph] of interest entire 12 years in running the company or posture in doing so over the last 20 or more years with the company.

Indra Nooyi
Ali and I’ll answer your first question in my closing comments for sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong
Thank you, good morning and congratulations Indra and best wishes from me as well. So I guess first on the guidance used so the FX [ph] obviously came down by about a percent, the core EPS didn’t change, the revenue went up, the tax rate came down so maybe there’s a little bit of additional pressure kind of between those lines, so maybe a little bit color there. And then just follow up on NAV pricing, so Q3, post Q3 the price increase, can you just give us a little bit color just the magnitude of the price increases and the category that you have announced the price increases and where you think the elasticity might be in terms of the pricing impact? Thanks.
Hugh Johnston
Yes, so in terms of the – the point that you made regarding the P&L. We’ve said all along to the degree that we have upsides from tax and things like that we intend to deliver our guidance and invest back in the business. You just heard me articulate a few of the areas that we’ve been investing in. Regarding pricing in the market place what we said broadly is the pricing will be somewhere in the low to mid single digits and that pricing is basically in right now in the beverage business.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays
Indra Nooyi
Good morning, Lauren.
Lauren Lieberman
Good morning, thank you. Indra, I was hoping to just take this opportunity to ask you kind of as you look forward and you think about what are the biggest opportunity do you think that are still ahead for PepsiCo what do think some of the biggest challenges are and into the loss that has been built under your watch to continue development for example of DST in the U.S. and that we’ve got this dramatic changes in retail. So if you could just give us some thoughts on kind of opportunities but then also some of the challenges and adjustments that might need to be made in the business model going forward as you set to your retirements in the company? Thanks.
Indra Nooyi
Thanks, Lauren. And I think PepsiCo has the scale and scope to remain one of the most successful food and beverage companies well into the future. I think over the years we’ve assembled the portfolio that is very synergistic, has tremendous growth potential and more importantly we’ve built out a geographic footprint which is quite impressive.
Going forward, I think there’s still tremendous amount of growth available in emerging markets. I think there’s growth available and re-thinking some of our businesses as platforms rather than just products. For example, we still haven’t fully exploited how snacks can be mini meals and what we can do with the combination of our snacks and dips [ph] and that’s something our teams are looking at very seriously. How do we look at sports beverages more as holistic sports nutrition on a sports field platform and our teams are looking at that? And so our growth prospects whether it’s a development markets or the developing markets and emerging markets is actually what we imagine it to be, not necessarily what the reported numbers are, so that’s the first topline opportunity.
I think the wonderful thing about PepsiCo is that we reinvent ourselves constantly, whether it’s rethinking innovation and top line new capabilities we need to invest behind, or if its re-thinking the cost structure. As I’ve said to many of you I think there’s lot of technology driven disruptions that are coming down the pie that are going to force us to rethink many many parts of our cost structure, but we started that work several years ago and I think over the next year or so you will start seeing a lot of these taking root, and how we implement these in the company and reshape our cost structure for the new realities is really going to separate the great companies from the not so great companies and I’m confident PepsiCo is among the great companies and we will re-shape our cost structure using technology as a big driver and I think will also use data analytics and insights to think about innovation a whole lot differently.

So I feel good about where we are. We have made a lot of investments, the trick now is to keep investing in the company judiciously so that we deliver a good balance of short term results and make investments to keep this engine going into the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Indra Nooyi
Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog
Good morning and congratulations to Hugh and Indra, we all wish you really the very best in the future. And I had a quick question on your guidance. Your outlook for organic sales is now slightly higher for the year, but it implies a sequential deceleration in Q4, so could you guys first reconcile that for us and then whether you are being conservative or is there something else going on and then I was also hoping to hear an update on your current thinking on the strategic options you are exploring for your beverage business in North America, guess I’m wondering if you guys have made any more progress and you know determining the right path for this business and really what your latest thoughts are on potential benefits of refranchising? Thanks.
Hugh Johnston
Yes, happy to jump in on that. Number one, I would remind you that the Q4 lap on revenue is more difficult that Q3 was so while the guidance does imply a sequential slowdown in Q4 some of our thinking is driven by that. And frankly the guidance we’ve laid out there is at least 3%, so we’ll see how the quarter comes. And regarding North America beverage and refranchising nothing new to report on that. We’ve said we look at it as we always do, the one thing that I would say generally is we do think the integrated system does make us more innovative, it does make us faster to respond to customer needs and it does make us more cost competitive. So those are the hurdles that we have to overcome if we were to see some benefit to refranchising in the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
Caroline Levy
Good morning and – and hi Indra congratulations and really can’t wait to see what you are up to next, and you’ve been a great role model for many women, so congratulations. I just – my question is on Frito North America where the margin growth hasn’t been as robust this year as it has historically and I’m wondering how you are thinking about the fourth quarter which has a very difficult lap. I know you had some one-time payments in the first quarter on bonuses, but as Frito has always been such a great driver of growth for the total company Frito, North America is there a point at which the margin expansion story thinking longer term maybe needs to slow as you invest in new opportunities?
Hugh Johnston
Hey Caroline, it’s Hugh. I think the answer to your question is no, because we think that, that business is so strong in its ability to leverage new ideas and new technology and to scale them relatively quickly to provide increased margin overtime. In terms of the short term numbers that you are speaking to, what are the factors affecting Frito-Lay this year is transport cost. Now transport in Frito was more heavily internal relative to beverages which uses more common carriers. So beverages has been more exposed to the driver shortage and the impact in terms of transport cost, but Frito-Lay is not immune to that it does use some common carrier and there is some wage inflation and the driver pool is well up. One of the things you will see Frito-Lay do is take some pricing in the fourth quarter particularly in single served which I think will mitigate the impact of the inflation and you will see their margin performance return to a more normal, a more normal margin improvement.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.

Andrea Teixeira
Hi, thank you and Indra thank you for making history and best wishes for you and Ramon as well.
Indra Nooyi
Thank you.
Andrea Teixeira
Thank you. My question is related to NAB, why are we encouraged to see the volumes return to positive, but the trends continue to decelerate on a two-year stag, so how should we think about volume performance on a sequential basis as you move through the fourth quarter, I’m assuming that you are going to have some of the results of your increased investments and also execution that strayed? Thank you.
Hugh Johnston
Yes, Andrea, I’m not going to – I don’t want to get into guidance on a division specific perspective and on a division specific quarterly perspective particularly not. I would view it as the business is both improving but it’s improving in a broad based way. So watching volume alone may not be as meaningful as watching the combination of volume and revenue particularly in light of the fact that where we’re seeing the best growth is often times in non-carbs and premium products which are obviously they moved the needle less on volume but they moved the needle on revenue in a substantive way. So, again I think the message here in terms of North America beverage is continued sequential improvement in the overall business. The pricing will obviously help in Q4 as well and we think we are getting that business back on track with the investments behind the advertising and the innovation that we have.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
Indra Nooyi
Good morning, Steve.
Hugh Johnston
Hey, good morning.
Steve Powers
Good morning and congrats and thank you from me as well Indra.
Indra Nooyi
Thank you, Steve.
Steve Powers
I guess – I had a question on I guess the question that Brian asked earlier on sort of a different perspective. If we step back and look at what’s happened over the course of the summer with the official creation of KBP [ph] with the alliance between Nestle and Starbucks with Coke purchasing body armor and then cost to coffee and your own action with SodaStream it just- it feels like there is a tremendous amount of activity and change all across beverages right now. I just – I’ve loved your thoughts as to why there is so much activity right now and what does it say about the feature of the LRB category and PepsiCo’s role in it amidst all this change? Thank you.
Indra Nooyi
Go ahead, Hugh.
Hugh Johnston
Yes. You know Steve I agree with you there is a large amount of activity right now and you just sighted a couple of competitors coming at it from a couple of different angles. I don’t want to speculate on their strategies as those are questions probably best asked of them. I do think you have people using different approaches to reach for growth and to reconstruct their portfolios to some degrees.
From PepsiCo’s perspective by and large we like the construction of our portfolio right now, it’s been built over the better part of the last two decades and we think it’s well positioned to compete, well positioned to innovate on as we build on the platforms that have existed here for a long time. SodaStream, I wouldn’t compare to the other things that you have citied, I think it’s an exception to the rule because it actually gets into a market that we weren’t playing in at all up until now and frankly I don’t think any of the other people that you mentioned are playing in a substantive way at all later, so I wouldn’t compare our move in SodaStream with some of the other competitive moves because I think it’s driven by a new opportunity for us as opposed to getting into categories that some of those folks already in that just weren’t scaled up.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.

Indra Nooyi
Good morning, Vivian.
Vivien Azer
Good morning, Indra and congratulations. One of the things that I think is rung through through your tenure at Pepsi and certainly coming through a lot and here on this call is the focus on innovation and how that really helps differentiate the story. So with that in mind, I was wondering whether you could speak at all to how Pepsi is thinking about an opportunity in Canada’s based products and specifically non-psyhcoactive cannabis as an additive to non-alcohol drinks. Thanks.
Indra Nooyi
I mean, really I don’t have anything to say, but Hugh, I don’t know if you want to add something there.
Hugh Johnston
Yes, I mean obviously we – I think it’s fair to say we look at everything, but I think that the difficulties in investing in that category particularly in the U.S. were federally these things are still not legal or quite a considerable challenge. So, we look at everything but certainly no plans at this point to do anything.

Good morning, Amit.
Amit Sharma.
Hi, good morning everyone. Hi, good morning, Indra and very best wishes for you after the retirement here. Two questions if I may. One, Hugh to your response on the NAB franchising and perfectly [Indiscernible] answer, I just wanted to look at it from, when you look at your potential partners from a bowling side, if that also a consideration in your decision to keep the current structure imtact?And then second, as we look to the end of this year or next year, there is a ton of contribution from below the line in terms of EPS, as you look at next year how much room do you have in that below the line in terms of flexibility or should we expect operating profit to be generally in line with earnings throughout next year?
Hugh Johnston
Yes, Amit happy to answer both of those. In terms of the potential bottling partners we have a lot of high quality bottlers in our business, so that’s not a factor in the decision. The factors are the ones that I mentioned earlier. Regarding your question on 2019, we are always quite disciplined around not talking of our guidance for 2019 or even things that potentially impact guidance until we get to that year, so we’ll talk about that in February.

Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
Pablo Zuanic
Thank you, all the best Indra. All the best, two quick questions if I can. You know a bit forward think in terms of snacks, it seems to me that yes, Frito is very strong and salty, but a lot of innovation it’s more on the savory side I would argue. We have seen a lot of the food companies coming into to snacks, so just help us frame how Pepsi fits in there, because from my perspective the company obviously protects it’s very strong salty franchise and they have seen adjacencies very lightly maybe perhaps not to dilute the core, but the market seems to be moving and shifting away from salty into those other categories, so is that a concern how should we think about that?
And the second very, very brief is there room for a closer collaboration with Starbucks in the case of coffee. I mean, obviously Starbuck now is doing things with Nestle overseas and in the U.S. is there room for Pepsi to do something with Nescafe for example if you can comment on that, thank you.
Hugh Johnston
Yes, Pablo, it’s Hugh. Regarding Frito-Lay I think we’ve continued to inch out of salty into savory, really over the course of the past decade or more whether it’s our Sabra joint venture or whether it’s Stacy’s, there is a lot of examples where we’ve gotten beyond salty and into savory. I think the good news is the combination of our consumer insights which are broad-based around how people consume snacks, I think leads us into savory in a fairly effective way. The reality of it is consumers don't think in these industrial terms like salty or savory. They think about occasions and they think about what they feel like eating. Frito-Lay's insights I think are extremely well-positioned to pick the right areas to go and to develop the right products to take advantage of those consumer opportunities. And then in addition to that, the scale of the Frito-Lay operation, once a decision is made to enter a new subcategory, I think allows us to be very very successful very very quickly.

The scale being from the perspective of brands, from the production systems, from the distribution systems, so I think you'll see Frito-Lay continue to be very successful in the savory area. Regarding your second question around Starbucks, look, we've had the Starbucks partnership now for the better part of 20 years. It's been remarkably successful for both of us. I think you'll continue to see us expand and build on the relationship with Starbucks.
Indra Nooyi
The only thing we're not going to do again is the restaurant business with Starbucks.
Hugh Johnston

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.
Indra Nooyi
Good morning, Robert.
Robert Ottenstein
Good morning and congratulations. Two questions, Indra, a little bit more big picture. First, a few years ago you describe and I think you were talking more about the U.S. consumer is somewhat confused on health and wellness issues in terms of how they were viewing sugar and artificial sweeteners. I think there's probably three years ago. So I'd loved to get an update in terms of your thinking about U.S. consumers is looking at the health and wellness space and particularly with regards to sugar and artificial sweeteners?
And then the other question is perhaps maybe give us a little bit more insight into your successor. Obviously he has done a fantastic job on the international front, but maybe a little bit of thought of kind of the things that he's done in his past that could be very helpful with the rest of the organization? Thank you.
Indra Nooyi
Yes. So I'll just speak to the U.S. consumer. What we have been seeing over the past three years is that even though there's occasional confusion on artificial sweeteners good for you or not, why not real sugar. What's wrong with the high fructose corn syrup, those kinds of questions, there is a general trend towards health and wellness, whether its consumption of more zero calorie, flavored waters or drinking diet products or lower calorie products, there's definitely a trend towards whole grains, closer to nature. So that trend might vary in speed year-over-year, but the trend is there.
And as a millennials age, I think they are driving this trend more and more. And the availability of more healthy products whether its ready prepared meals or home delivery of anything that's healthy is actually taking away any barriers to buying a healthier products whether it's better for you or good for you products. So I think you're going to see an acceleration towards that trend as the years go by.
Now Ramon is an outstanding executive and you'll get a chance to get to know him over the next few weeks and months. The good thing is a lot of the trends we are seeing in the U.S. have already happened in Europe, whether its retail consolidation, whether its trends towards health and wellness, competition amongst all of the European food and beverage companies where warehouse delivered products are really have to negotiate to the retailers, all of those trends, Ramon is a veteran of. And he's going to bring all those skills to the United States.
Second as you know over the last year as President, Ramon has been leading the productivity program for the company, been leading innovation. So I think he's uniquely suited to bring a fresh pair of eyes to everything we do here in North America while preserving its knowledge of the international market. Finally, he's just a good guy. I think you'll find his mix of operating expertise, plus his ability to think about customers, consumers, and bring the two together, to be refreshing. So get to know him. I think you will be very happy with what you see.

Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.

Indra Nooyi
Hello, Laurent.
Laurent Grandet
Hey, good morning, Indra, good morning, Hugh. Indra, so let me first congratulate you on for having been at the forefront of consumer goods company with performance [indiscernible] your vision that redefine, I think, the company role in society and embrace, I mean, the new reality of consumer mindset. So having seen this from the insight I can only relay your passion and commitment were second to none.
Indra Nooyi
Thank you.
Laurent Grandet
So, maybe something you will cover in your closing remarks, what will you have done differently should you have the opportunity to rewind time? And then more in the business, right now, your campaign, Pepsi generations and increased A&M behind the brand did probably enough to stabilize the brand Pepsi this year? Now, good thing that the campaign was probably pleasing to boomers with some nostalgia retro back, but not sure it's attracting the consumer into the franchise. So could you please share with us Pepsi specific, I mean, brand KPIs especially as -- in regards to millennial consumers, please?
Hugh Johnston
Yes. So as you might imagine that the KPIs on Pepsi are the ones that you would traditionally look at. First, the highest level market share performance and velocities in the stores from a consumer perspective we tend to look at purchase intent regard relevance to consumers. A lot of this stuff is done through survey work. And we have seen over time the metrics that we measure while it may not be immediately responsive. They do tend to prove out over time sales trends both positively and negatively.
And the good news is what we are starting to see are given the increases in advertising early green shoots of improvement in those performance metrics, that again do overtime tend to correlate with sales performance.
Indra Nooyi
Thank you all for your questions. Just, let me make some closing comments. After 12 years at the helm of the company, today is my final day as CEO. It ends my 24-year career as a PepsiCo Executive. I have been blessed to have had the opportunity to lead such a great company and work with such incredible people including our outstanding board, executives and other associates, our customers and other partners, our shareholders and all our other stakeholders.
You know 12 years is a long time as a CEO, and even though I have a lot of fuel still left in my tank. I wanted to do something different with my life. Spend more time with my family and give the next generation in PepsiCo a chance to lead this great company.
Throughout my tenure however, we've strived to achieve a difficult balance between attending to short term pressures while managing for the long-term. And I'll leave today proud of the work our team has done. We were pioneers in business sustainability and social responsibility and embedded the sense of purpose in everything PepsiCo does guided by our Performance with Purpose philosophy. We have transformed our product portfolio by growing our good for you and better for you option from about 38% of revenue in 2006 to roughly 50% in 2017. 
We more than doubled our investment in research and development to expand our more nutritious offerings and minimize our environmental impact. We became an even more valued partner to our retail customers. We were selected as a number one food and beverage supply in the United States in the most recent 2017 Advantage Report and named Best-in-Class Manufacturer by Kantar for the second year in a row.
We've made positive contributions to communities around the globe in which we operate through our support of access to clean drinking water, human rights, nutrition, agricultural programs and many more initiatives. And we invested significantly new capabilities in areas like design and e-commerce to better position our company for a successful future.

In the midst of managing the business for the long-term, we also delivered strong and consistent financial performance specifically during the period 2006 to 2017. Net revenue grew more than 80%. We added a new billion dollar brand almost every other year. We returned $79 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our market capitalization increased by $68 billion. Dividends per share nearly tripled from $1.16 to $3.17, and we generated total shareholder return of 162%.
Finally and very importantly, we have been on Ethisphere's list of most ethical companies for the past 12 years. For all of this I am grateful to my outstanding PepsiCo associates who gave so much to PepsiCo and me over the past 12 years.
And now, I’m handing the reins to Ramon Laguarta, who becomes PepsiCo’s sixth CEO. Ramon is a terrific executive with a long and proven track record of growing businesses. He has a deep understanding of the changing preferences of consumers and other critical trends unfolding around the world, and he has demonstrated that he knows how to navigate them successfully. He has been a critical partner to me in running the company and I’m confident he will lead PepsiCo to new and greater heights in the years to come. The potential for PepsiCo is enormous. Finally, I want to thank you, our investors and analysts.
During my time as CEO and CFO, I’ve had a lot of spirited and fascinating conversations with many of you. I’ve always valued your perspectives even in those instances when we may have disagreed. You often challenged me, offered your opinions and provided different perspectives. My interactions with you over the years helped make me a better executive and helped make PepsiCo a better company. Thank you all for your time today and your engagement through the years. And thank you for the confidence you have placed in us with your investment. Thanks.

Good day. My name is Latif, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Kraft Heinz Company's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.
I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.
Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our business update. We'll start today's call with an overview of our third quarter and nine months results as well as our view on the path forward from Bernardo Hees, our CEO; and David Knopf, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, Paulo Basilio, President of our U.S. Zone, will join the rest of us for the Q&A session.
Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation available on our website.
Now let's turn to slide 2, and I'll hand it over to Bernardo.
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Three months ago, we said that we expected organic growth from Q3 onwards, driven by a stronger more incremental marketing and innovation pipeline, leveraging investments in category management and go-to-market capabilities and supported by incremental merchandising spend and best-in-class customer service.
Today, we believe and are confident our Q3 results show that the turnaround of our top line performance is firmly underway, not just in terms of headline organic growth, but also real volume growth.
The transitory factors that negatively impacted first half sales are fading as expected and we saw further improvement in consumption trends in most countries, in most key categories. In fact on a global basis, more than half of our categories saw consumption growth in Q3.
In our categories in United States, are going to a trend bend, with aggregate consumption across our categories, improving nearly 2 percentage points in Q3 versus Q2. Excluding planters club entity, they are flipping from negative to positive.
Our market shares are also improving. Across the total company, Kraft Heinz is holding or growing share in more than half of our categories, including very strong market share gains in our Rest of World markets.
And finally, we continue to see solid performance in non-measured channels, including e-commerce and global foodservice. Breakthrough innovation and strong in-store activity, distribution gains and whitespace expansion are coming together.
Overall, while we did provide solid end market support for these activities and pricing in Q3 was down versus the prior year, it's important to note that our commercial growth is positive.

Commercial profitability or the profit contribution from price, volume and mix is positive and growing. Execution is improving, and our pipeline is getting stronger, both in terms of innovation and go-to-market initiatives.
At the same time, third quarter profitability was held back by several one-off factors, including commercial investments, the unfavorable impacts of bonus accrual versus 2017 and supply chain inflation as we expected, but also, by our decision to prioritize customer service as you saw volumes ramp-up and for goals, some degree of profitability in the short term.
In the end, we are confident pushing commercial growth higher, given the greater visibility we have on both retailer support and consumer interest in our programming as well as below-the-line for favorability from both tax and lower-than-expected interest expenses that we see coming through.
And as David will discuss, we are equally confident that profitability will improve going forward, as one-off negative factors from Q3 fall away. But before I hand it over to David, I think it's important to recognize that the commercial growth you're now seeing, and I believe that are in the path to sustainable, profitable growth, and driven by the fact that we are adapting the company with speed. And doing these two investments in both, our people and in-house capabilities.
On the slide 3, we show this fixed goals from the post integration framework, we introduced early this year. During the third quarter, we continued to make good progress in each one of those areas. More important, the different investments and in-house capability we have built are now coming together for measurable, sustainable gains and making our brands more relevant than ever.
For instance, look at our efforts in data driven marketing and brand building and innovation, we can see in United States that our ratio of quality impression to total impression is at 75%, significantly outpacing the industry average, (6:52) impression, I expect it to be up 9% in 2018 versus the prior year.
And year-to-date, we have had $14.5 billion PR impressions versus $13.5 billion of all of 2017, all good numbers, but more powerful when you consider how these two areas come together to drive incremental gains.
For instance, again in the United States, our PR campaigns to generate awareness for the launch of Heinz Mayo, not only lead to strong share gains in Mayo, but gave birth to a new product, Heinz Mayochup, which just landed of the shelves of American retailers and we will be going to the UK next.
This summer, Country Time rally people to save lemonade stands contributing to the strong gains we're seeing in our beverage mix business. And now our renovate all natural Capri Sun line up is taking ongoing in-school cafeterias through the #SitTogether pledge.
The data driven insights and in-house capability that drive these results are scalable and sharable across all categories and geographies. I mentioned on last call that you felt, that you had the strongest pipeline of activities in place. In our short history at Kraft Heinz and the numbers are starting to prove it.
In a similar fashion, our efforts to reinvent category management by deploying tools like revenue management, assortment management and planograms are supporting and informing everything we do, as we expand go-to-market capabilities around the world. For instance, we have more than doubled our in-store head count in United States, now fully trained Kraft Heinz employees armed with insights from our category management tools are helping to drive faster product velocity.
In areas, where we have greater in-store coverage we are seeing better performance in our key power windows, lower rates of out-of-stock merchandising and brand activation to display and shelving initiatives. This will help us push our total dollar velocities ahead of category average. And in both meals and sauces, our combination of powerhouse brands and optimize category management activities is driving dollar velocities 40% and 28% above their respective category average.

And we have been able to push strong incremental gains with innovation like Just Crack an Egg, which in the third quarter had velocities that outperformed its entire category. The old (10:07) United States retail in foodservice, you are seeing the benefits from assortment management, as we look to expand distribution and drive incremental gains in each region of the world, while reducing complexity in our supply chain.
And in the digital space, our year-to-date e-commerce sales in United States are up roughly 80%. We are capturing our fair share. And in many focused categories like snacks, nuts and condiments, we're significantly ahead of our fair share.
That being said, we still see a long runway for global growth. The ability to further leverage our data-driven insight and category management knowledge and we're investing aggressively in the next generation of capabilities.
These initiatives include deploying the next-generation of our Kraft recipes website, a cornerstone of our relationship marketing effort; building easy-to-use mobile technologies that learns about you and your family; recommends meal plans; and seamlessly connects you to grocers; and establishing a venture capital fund that can invest up to $100 million in emerging tech companies to further strengthen our business model.
From a capability building perspective, these initiatives can improve our ability to engage consumers in an environment characterized by expanding retail channels and fast-changing shopping patterns.
Finally, what make all of this come together is our effort to build best-in-class operations, as well as recruit, develop and align our people. In operations, we continue to deliver against industry-leading targets, we set for ourselves in quality, safety and customer service in all geographies where we operate.
Cost is one area we are falling short this year. This is due to a combination of greater than expected cost inflation in United States, our desire to invest and protect customer service as we ramp-up volumes as well as (12:43) to delay some savings projects to avoid operational disruption.
That said, we believe we have the right people, the right training and the right level of engagement to execute with excellency in all areas going forward. Specifically, our employees' recruiting remain strong with more than 85 candidates for each spot in our United States trainee and MBA program, and more than 400 candidates per spot internationally.
And our vertical promotion ratios are up versus prior year showing meritocracy in action. To summarize, we feel good about our commercial performance, sales and profitability and our ability to sustain this positive momentum. We continue to build and deploy new capabilities and adapt with speed. And while we have seen and accepted more volatility in EBITDA in the near-term, we believe our investments will allow our brand to be there in a bigger way tomorrow.
I will now hand it over to David to provide more color in our results and our path forward.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thank you, Bernardo and hello everyone. Turning to our results on slide 4. Total company organic net sales were up 2.6% in Q3, bringing year-to-date organic growth into positive territory. This was driven by 3.5 percentage points of volume/mix growth in Q3 and bringing volume/mix to essentially flat through the first nine months. Encouragingly, this performance was driven by volume/mix growth in every reporting segment and led by consumption growth in a majority of U.S. categories.
Pricing was down 90 basis points in Q3, driven by increased promotional activity and key commodity-related pricing in the United States that more than offset higher pricing, mainly to offset local inflation and Rest of World markets.

By segment, the U.S. had a strong volume/mix led quarter, characterized by consumption-led growth across the majority of categories. As expected, the change from positive first half pricing in the U.S. to lower pricing in Q3 was primarily driven by combination of three factors. One, lacking carryover pricing from last year; two, increase in-store activity to support our commercial pipeline, including higher year-over-year support in natural cheese and ready-to-drink beverages; and three, passing-through recent declines in some key commodities during the quarter, mainly bacon.
In Canada, while we saw solid growth in Coffee and Mac & Cheese, sales were down as anticipated from a combination of select product discontinuations, higher promotional expenses in the current year as well as comparisons with prior year limited time condiments offers and activities that were not repeated. As we mentioned on our last call, however, we do expect a solid pipeline of activities to return Canada to growth in Q4.
EMEA stayed in positive growth territory in Q3 as strong growth in Southern Europe and Germany, where we continue to grow the Kraft brands more than offset some one-off headwinds in Middle East. And in Russia, where we ran into destocking activity related to World Cup-related promotional products.
That said, we expect EMEA to improve sequentially in Q4 as the headwinds in Middle East and Russia fall away. And in Rest of World, in addition to the strong contribution from pricing, we've seen all year, Latin America drove strong organic volume/mix gains from a combination of pasta sauce and condiments growth in Brazil as well as whitespace expansion across the region. And this more than offset lower shipments of canned seafood and cordials in Indonesia.
Moving to EBITDA. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was in fact lower than expectations we had outlined in our previous earnings call, resulting in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA now being down 7.2% on a constant currency basis. We certainly benefited from organic net sales growth. And in fact, our commercial profitability with the profit contribution from volume/mix and pricing combined, was positive. Despite all the stepped up merchandising activity we carried out during the quarter. However, several factors that we do not expect to repeat negatively impacted both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of profitability in Q3.
As expected and as we outlined in our previous call, year-on-year EBITDA growth was negatively impacted by a combination of the commercial investment programs we've talked about all year, the swing from overhead favorability last year to a more normal bonus incentive compensation accrual this year, and the non-key commodity inflation we've previously noted.
In addition to that, our absolute level of profitability in Q3, was negatively impacted by three factors. The first was higher than expected one-off operating costs in the U.S. from our decision to prioritize customer service, delays some saving projects to avoid disruption and buy more spot market freight during the quarter than we otherwise would, in a normal course of business. Second, was the disproportionate impact from commercial investments, particularly marketing, as we stepped up our investment levels in the second half of the year. And third, were some unanticipated one-off supply chain costs mainly in the Middle East.
Looking forward, we expect both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of EBITDA margin to improve beginning in Q4. Specifically, we expect to sustain our organic top line momentum, the one-off factors that drag Q3 EBITDA down should fall away. And on top of that, we expect to see a better year-on-year balance between cost inflation and savings.
Finally, at adjusted EPS, we were down $0.05 versus Q3 last year as lower taxes on adjusted earnings in the current period mitigated part of the adjusted EBITDA decline.

I would also add here that for the full-year in 2018, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 20% versus 21% previously. And incremental interest expense in 2018 should be roughly $70 million versus the $80 million, we previously outlined.
Which leads to our outlook on slide 5. I'll start by reiterating what we said before that we believe the pipeline and capabilities are now in place for us to push a more aggressive growth agenda from innovation that drives incremental consumption, to distribution gains across channels and expanding our brands into geographic and category whitespace.
We continue to believe we're in a strong position to deliver organic growth for the full-year and sustain that momentum into 2019. We also expect a much better balance of top and bottom line growth going forward.
2018 has clearly been a year where results have been more or less dominated by a number of transitory issues, on both the sales and cost sides of the equation, that we do not expect to repeat.
At the same time, we've essentially accelerated what would have been three years of commercial investments into 2018, push commercial grow even harder than originally planned, given greater visibility over the likely success of our pipeline. And this was largely offset by tax savings.
Going forward, we feel good about our ability to continue driving commercial growth and our ability to drive EBITDA dollar growth and industry-leading margins as one-off factors fall away and the contribution from our savings initiatives accelerate.
To-close, I think it's worth repeating the thoughts that we've expressed all year, that we're developing capabilities to create brand and category advantage and achieve profitable growth that we're investing aggressively now in order to see benefits sooner, and that these are the key factors shaping our near-term results into 2018 and we believe will drive sustainable profitable growth into 2019 and beyond.
We think our focus on EBITDA dollars and our returned based discipline in sales, marketing and innovation will lead us well positioned to deliver top-tier organic growth at industry-leading margins.
We have good visibility on considerably better post-integration cash flow. We have and will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and credit standing through both de-risking and other activities such as divestitures of non-core assets when consistent with our strategic framework as we recently announced.
And our ability to continue building brand and category advantage through differentiated capabilities will not only be a key enabler, but will make two plus two equal more than four in the event of a transformational deal.
Now we'd be happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your question please.
Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thank you so much. Wondering if you can help us quantify the magnitude of what you would consider one-time or non-recurring cost in the P&L. There is a lot different costs, there is a lot of different things that drag down your EBITDA this quarter. I think some of them like marketing probably don't go away, some of them like maybe the customer service issues maybe do go away. I'm just trying to get a sense of that, because it's difficult to maybe model ahead unless we have a better understanding of sort of what just happened.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Ken, this is David. Thanks for the question. So, as I break this down for you, I think the first thing to reiterate here is commercial profitability for Q3 or the profit contribution from vol/mix and pricing combined was positive, okay? Which is good considering all the growth initiatives and stepped up merchandising activity that we had in the quarter. So, we're very happy with that.

Beyond that, there are really four main drivers of the year-over-year decline, many of which were one-off in nature. So first, we have the stepped up commercial investments that we previously outlined, with Q3, seeing the heaviest quarterly impact within the year.
Second, you have the swing from overhead favorability we mentioned last year to more normal incentive compensation accrual this year, so that is one-off in nature.
Third, we had additional cost inflation that we previously noted, however the impact was worse in Q3 from our decision to prioritize customer service, as our volumes ramped up through the quarter, which in turn led us to delay certain supply chain savings projects and also by more spot markets freight than we otherwise would have.
So, a lot of those factors were in fact kind of one-off in nature for the quarter. On top of that, we had some unanticipated one-off supply chain costs that were mainly related to the transition of the Middle East business to our European business.
All that to say, we're not going to provide precise numbers around it but we expect both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of profitability to improve significantly beginning in Q4 and into next year versus what we saw this year and in the first half.
Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then can you – as a follow-up, just the prioritizing of customer service is a headwind, can you just walk us through what that means in practical terms? I'm not quite sure I understand in this case.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Yeah, sure, Ken. This is David, again. So I'd say some of the savings projects that we anticipated for this year were very much variable cost in nature, so things like yield and variable labor. So – and this is versus fixed cost that we've captured over the last three or so years. So we decided to delay some of those productivity initiatives that we're executing across our factories. And this is really to ensure that there is no disruption as volumes ramped up in the quarter and ramped up more than, frankly, we had expected. On top of that, the additional volume that we didn't anticipate above and beyond what we planned for came at an additional cost and a lot of those costs are logistics or freight related.
Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your question, please.
Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Two questions from me. One is just a follow-up to Ken's question. I think on the last earnings call, the expectation was the EBITDA split for the year would be roughly 50-50, first half, second half. So given that we missed by, I don't know, about $100 million or so in the quarter. I guess the question is, is the split for the year now more like 49-51? Or is the split different? Just trying to get a sense for kind of where things stood relative to maybe where you're fourth quarter expectations were. And then I have a follow-up.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Bryan, thanks for the question. This is David, again. So as we said in the last call, as you pointed out, and as we said today, we do expect both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of EBITDA margin to improve in the back half and further improve in Q4. And this is based on the sustained organic top-line momentum that we're seeing, the one-off factors that I talked about that drag EBITDA this quarter which will fall away next quarter, and a better year-on-year balance between cost inflation and savings.
Relative to your specific question that we talked for the last quarter, I think given the unexpected one-off factors in Q3 that we experienced, it may be difficult to get all the way back to the 50-50, first half, second half, (28:32) EBITDA that we targeted. But we should see a very good sequential improvement into Q4.

Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. So order of magnitude, it's around that $100 million sort of miss in the quarter is sort of the one-off piece that you may or may not be able to close the gap on?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Yeah, I think around that range would be appropriate.
Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then just one other question in terms of asset sales. I guess the asset sale in India. is that sort of indicative of the larger sort of strategy of maybe potentially selling more assets down the road? Just some color or some context around that as well. Thanks.
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Bryan. Hees (29:17) Bernardo. Look, we – like we always said, we like our portfolio. I think each brand has its role in its specific country and region. But we do evaluate every business and brand on its own and see the returns and what we can do with that, right?
In the India case, I think it was very clear for us that we didn't have really the competitive advantage in the new market and the beverage portfolio we have in the country. It could not scale, right, for the level you wanted to. (29:55)
And the value we're receiving from the proceeds are really higher than we could have been doing with the business. Like you said, I think there are other things to be considered within the portfolio in general. And we always evaluate very careful on a case-by-case situation. I think an important side effect of this is really the fact that we – obviously, with the proceeds, we're able to strengthen our balance sheet, right, and give us more firepower, especially in a moment where industry evaluations are more attractive, right? And that I think is a positive in this case.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula of UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Hi. Thanks for the question. So similar to the previous two, I wanted to dig into the $100 million EBITDA miss that we saw in the quarter. At what point did you realize that things were tracking below plan? How did you react to it? And can you walk us through what of that $100 million actually washes away in the fourth quarter? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Sure, Steve. This is David, again. Thanks for the question. So we said that we expected Q3 adjusted EBITDA dollars to be down a greater order of magnitude than what we saw in the first half. So that gets you to more than $140 million at the start. So kind of two big factors in the quarter that took us lower than what we had originally expected. Again, we had a higher than expected one-off operating cost in the U.S. against a prioritized customer service. We delayed some of those savings projects to avoid disruptions. And we bought more on the freight market, which increased our logistics costs than we otherwise would have given the additional volume. And then on top of that, the unanticipated one-off supply chain costs.
But again as I said, we expect both EBITDA growth and our absolute level of profitability to improve significantly into next quarter. But unfortunately, we're not going to provide any more specifics around the magnitude of that into Q4.
Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And given what you've seen right now, is there any reason to think that EBITDA dollar growth can't expand in calendar 2019? I know it's early to talk about 2019, but given the inconsistency of recent performance, I think, maybe investors deserve a little bit of clarity as to how confident you feel about the sustainability of what the trends you're seeing develop in the fourth quarter. And is the tax rate sustainable at 20%? Thank you.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.

Sure, Steve. David, again here. Thanks for the question. So for 2019, we do expect a much better balance of top- and bottom-line growth going forward. In 2018, we've had a number of transitory issues that we don't expect to repeat. We really accelerated and pushed commercial growth harder given the greater visibility on the investments that we're driving and putting in the business. And then on top of that, the tax favorability which mitigated a number of these headwinds on the bottom-line.
Going forward, we feel good about that balance for several reasons. Our ability to continue driving real volume/mix driven organic growth; our ability to drive EBITDA dollars and at industry-leading margins as one-off factors fall away and the contributions from our savings curve accelerate.
And finally, I think our ability to build the brand and category advantages and capabilities that we've been talking about, the same thing will make two plus two greater than four in the event of a transformational deal.
And then finally, with respect to your tax rate, I think we started the year a bit higher but based on further clarity on new tax laws, I think, we're really expecting to get to that 20% for the full year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. So I just want to focus on U.S. pricing. I understand that some of the decline was probably pass-through pricing, but I'm assuming you're still down ex that or at least not up substantially, which is surprising just given the level of gross margin pressure and EBITDA pressure we're seeing here at the corporate level. So just wanted to get your thoughts around what sort of drove the sequential deceleration in pricing?
Obviously, a lot of your direct and even more so indirect peers in CPG land have been talking about taking more pricing recently given some of the margin pressures in this sector. So do you have plans to increase pricing going forward? And as you look at your price premiums in the categories you compete, given they moved up over the last few years, do you think you need adjustments in those price premiums? Or are you comfortable you can get more pricing going forward? Thanks.
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Dara. This is Paulo. Thanks for the question. So when we think about the price and the profile we have in the quarter, it was really consistent with our expectations. The change from the positive pricing we had in the first half to a lower net pricing in the third quarter was primarily driven by three factors. The first one was we start lapping (35:45) the carryover pricing we had from prior year. Second, we pass through recent commodity declines, mainly in bacon. And given our strong innovation pipeline and portfolio position, we believe that was the right time to expand trial, consumption, and drive strong volume gains which we didn't (36:05).
As David noted before, our commercial profitability or our profit contribution from pricing and vol/mix was solid. We believe that we have a very strong portfolio of brands with ability to price as we have been showing over the past several quarters as we've mentioned. And for your last point, and you look forward to the next year, for sure, price will be an important lever we will consider in managing our cost profile.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then the comment on 2019 EBITDA, I just want to be clear. You talked about a better balance. Did you mean year-over-year growth in EBITDA in 2019, just to be clear? Or are we talking about sort of level of improvement relative to 2018? I just want to be precise there. Thank you.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.

Hi, Dara. This is David, again. Thanks for the question. So, when we talk about our ability to drive EBITDA dollars, we do mean year-over-year.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your question, please.
Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, good afternoon. Just two things from me. One quick one first. Sometimes when – I think when investors hear sort of the term spending to ensure customer service and things like that, I mean sometimes the notion comes up of, is it slotting or paying more to keep product on the shelf for retailers sort of asking for more dollars or those sorts of things. So, I was hoping you could just address that just to take that off the table if that's not the case.
And then I guess more importantly, putting the one-offs and the one-off spending aside, you still did it looks like or sounds like increased sort of commercial spending, spending around capabilities, spending that's ongoing that will be in the base, if you will.
And it sounded like after the second quarter that you had a pretty good read on that and obviously it increased in the third. So, really, I guess what gives you that comfort level that this is the right number and that in 2019 there's not, ultimately, the need for another significant step-up? Because we have seen some other food companies already starting to talk to 2019 and saying, hey, one year of reinvestment spending that was tax reform-led actually isn't enough to get the top-line going. It really needs to be a multi-year timeframe. So, any color on that would be really helpful, too. Thank you.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Andrew, this is David. Thanks for the question. So, let me take your first question and then I'll take part of your second question and hand it to Bernardo. So in terms of the costs, additional costs that we incurred, that were one-off in nature to support the volume, these were not any sort of trade or slotting cost. These were twofold.
One kind of logistics, freight costs which were higher than what we anticipated given whenever we have more volume than what we planned for, you need to go to the spot market and specifically more expenses. Going forward, as we planned the higher volumes, you wouldn't expect to see those same level of cost.
The second piece was actually less about cost inflation and more about our savings projects, which we chose to delay. So, in short, it was not related to anything like freight or slotting fees.
In terms of the commercial spending, I think just one important caveat here. We did talk about the incremental investments this year. We did have some kind of one-off costs associated with the fact that as you release this into the P&L, it did come in higher in Q3 than what would be reflected on a run-rate basis. So there is kind of some lumpiness from the quarter-to-quarter perspective that drove EBITDA down that is one-off in nature. But that's on top of the investments that we talked about and anticipated this year. And then, I'll turn it to Bernardo to answer your last question.
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Andrew. In respect of the level and thinking already about 2019, we do believe what's the right call in the beginning of 2018 to take the decision to go to the $300 million commercial investment given the benefit in the strong balance sheet we have with tax reform and so on. And this number is already in our base. So to be honest, looking to 2019, we do believe the investments we're doing now is not only for 2018, but there are significant benefits coming in the quarters to come in 2019 and beyond. I think the commercial results with the volume/mix grow especially in the United States is a good testament (41:01) to that. So as we're seeing today, I think the numbers are already in our base. We are not seeing the reason to increase that into 2019.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Just one question on pricing and promotion effectiveness, you've talked about and we've heard about your sales team making pitches for promotional changes out there with retailer customers using data to do that. It's not always easy to get retailers to change the promotions that they currently do. They feel like they know what they're going to get. And we see in these results it's tough to see the effectiveness really coming through. You talked about cheese and ready-to-drink promotions as drags on margins. So can you just speak to the traction you're getting? Maybe provide some examples or maybe some evidence of how you're getting smarter and convincing retailers to take this journey with you on promotion effectiveness? Thanks.
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, David. This is Paulo. I think the main driver here to see this is the comments that we saw the commercial profitability that we saw in the quarter. So, we are really comfortable and happy with the efficiencies we got in the moment that we decided to do the investments we did. So, in the start of the promo discussion, I think we are – yeah, we've been investing in revenue management strategy. We've been getting (42:50), which type of promotion to execute. And an example, I think we were very successful in the beverage promotions that we did in ready-to-drink. And all this ended up appearing in our commercial profitability.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is open.
Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thank you. Good evening. Just had two questions for you, if I could. The first would just be, as we think in relation to the gross margin performance, you mentioned before David some comments about positive commercial profits. And but I was surprised with the weakness in the gross margin. So I want to make sure I understand some of those unique factors, how they would've affected gross margin versus, say, SG&A. I felt like some of those were could have gone either way. Do you have any color on that you can provide?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Chris. This is David. Thanks for the question. Yes, so, we did see both gross margin and SG&A increase into that way on EBITDA margin. Again, driven by the same factors that I talked about with the higher-than-expected supply chain cost in the U.S., okay? So more related to operations side.
Disproportionate impact from the commercial investments that we made, which is going to be on the SG&A line. And then unanticipated one-off supply chain costs from the Middle East that we moved to Europe. And that will be more of a gross profit, gross margin impact. But again, as many of these one-off factors fall away, we would expect to see the dollars and the profitability improve significantly in Q4 and going into next year. And that's going to be across both gross margin and SG&A.
Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, thank you for that. And then just a question in relation to your U.S. sales, you had obviously very strong performance there, volume driven. I don't see that level of growth in the measured channels. But I wonder if you could say is there anything unique that's helping boost the U.S. sales in this quarter, being new products, that kind of thing? Or maybe also how your unmeasured channels performed in the quarter to help kind of round up that performance for the U.S.?
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.

Hi, Chris, this is Paulo. Thanks for the question. We estimate that our underlying consumption growth in Q3 was roughly 1.3% across all retail channel splits and service. This excludes the Planters and club where we lapped shipment loss in July. The strong trends (45:22) we saw in first half was pretty much driven by frozen, snack nuts, beverage, meats and sauces businesses.
The other drivers in Q3, if you go for Q3, were a combination of inventory shift and timing of (45:38) prior year. Net-net, these other factors added roughly 50 basis points to authentic growth in Q3.
Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC
Thanks for the question. Wanted to delve into this time you've been using commercial profitability. Can you just talk through like, what is included in that number and why is that a good measure of sort of the ongoing profitability of the business? That would be helpful, and I have a follow-up.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Sure. Akshay, this is David. Thanks for the question here. So, in terms of the commercial profitability, as we look at it, we define is as the contribution from pricing and vol mix, okay? So EBITDA together. And this is before things like investments and inflation on the business.
Now, the reason that we're calling it out is because we think it's important to understand that even with the lower negative pricing year-over-year, the significant volume pickup that we had that was significantly positive leading to organic growth, was positive on EBITDA and not negative.
That being said, we're still seeing inflation and we need to address the inflation in the business, which in the near term we're managing with our savings curve. And going forward we'll evaluate other levers like price.
Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC
Got it. So in other words, I mean when the market's seeing pricing down and profits down, they're assuming you've got the profit from taking pricing lower, right? And what you're trying to say is that's not what happened basically?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Yes, Akshay. The key point here is that, profitability on a dollar perspective actually increased in despite negative pricing because our volume mix was so strong in the quarter, which we are very happy with.
Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC
Got it. I'll pass it on. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi, sorry about that. Can you guys hear me?
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Yes.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Awesome. A little phone malfunction here on my end. I wanted to come back trying to sort of unpack the drivers of the decline from a slightly different angle. Looking at the EBITDA year-on-year decline in the U.S., it's been accelerating obviously at least another $100 million-plus of year-on-year erosion this quarter. It sounds like that's predominantly driven by these onetime factors, right, as well as maybe a little bit of bonus accrual?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Jason, this is David. Thanks for the question. That is correct. So the same factors that I outlined on a global basis are very much the drivers for the U.S. year-over-year and a big piece of that is going to be the bonus accrual that were lapping from prior year has an impact in our year-over-year growth. And then the other items were more related to our kind of current year margin profile, all of which together is why we feel confident that we'll see that sequential improvement into Q4.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

And maybe you can help me size the bonus piece thing because if I look at $100 million, I hear you on marketing, geez, with the amount of marketing you spend in the U.S. an incremental $10 million will be a really high percent. So it's hard to see that incremental marketing is a material driver. And it's difficult to wrap our head around the logistic side being another $100 million or so that it would kind of had to be the bridge there. So maybe I'm not just fully appreciating the magnitude of this bonus accrual. Can you contextualize that for us with some real numbers?
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, Jason, this is David. So unfortunately we can't provide specific numbers on the bonus and some of these other drivers. But what I'd say is, the bonus is quite a large driver in the year-over-year delta as you can imagine the magnitude, the variable compensation that we have.
On top of that the operational costs are also quite significant in the quarter, both the logistics costs I talked about as well as the savings projects that we didn't anticipate in Q3, but we're ready to execute at the right moment. And then finally there was a supply chain cost that we talked about related to Middle East and Europe. So, I think there are a few different components. The two largest I guess I can go ahead and say are the bonus and the higher operational costs that we talked about.
Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay. I had to try. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hi, thank you for the question. I thought that your shipments in the U.S. were shipping slightly above the consumption that we were measuring in Nielsen. Presumably, I think it's because you're getting more shelf space. But I tried to find that in Nielsen data and I couldn't really get it. Maybe it's on a lag. Can you speak a bit about the shelf space that you might have gained from all these new product introductions? Are you seeing it in your tracking data? And also are you taking steps to make sure that you're not causing an environment where maybe there could be an inventory de-load in fourth quarter, which has happened before but maybe not with all these new products? Thanks.
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Hi, this is Paulo. So, again if you think about the breakdown between the 1.8% growth, 1.3% is coming from what we're seeing is underlying real consumption in Q3. The other 50 bps is the volume effect of that I mentioned about combination of timing of to expand an inventory shift (51:47). So the real consumption we see for the business is 1.3%. And this is pretty much a combination of a management channel's growing around 0.8% and un-corporate channels, including foodservice growing another 50 bps.
So that is how we're seeing our consumption happen. So, we are very happy, confident with the consumption improvement. We are seeing this in Q3. We're also seeing this in Q4. So we're seeing our real, as I said, underlying consumption growth in Q3 in the level of 1.3%.

David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Great. Thank you so much and good evening. So just wanted to confirm, Paulo, I think you said that shipments in the quarter were ahead of the consumption including the unmeasured channels. Is that correct? And then will that reverse out in the fourth quarter?
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.
No. No. What I said now is that our underlying consumption overall is around 1.3% growth year-over-year. And this 1.3% is a combination of measured channels 0.8% growth plus 50 bps coming from other unmeasured channels including foodservice.

David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. A follow-up on the bonus question. So in most companies when we see companies miss profit targets, usually the bonus accruals are – they go the opposite way. There's not more bonuses. There is less bonuses. Why is it working that way here? I just don't understand something.
And then I just had a final question on market share. Can you give us some sense on your read on Kraft Heinz's market share movement across its major categories and major geographies? It's a big picture question. A lot of companies have some nice simple metrics to give us an understanding as to whether or not you're gaining or holding share in certain percentages of categories. I don't know if you guys can provide that, but it would be helpful. Thank you.

Hi, Rob. It's Bernardo. In regarding to metrics of compensation, and so as we have been discussing quite some time, we are very performance driven organization, right? In our case here, since the beginning of the year we have a combination of different KPIs between top-line growth that have been accelerating EBITDA and cash flow.
And we deem the strength, the variable compensation established by – with this in mind and looking at our balance sheet, our performance this year have been surpassing significant performance last year. Not in all KPIs, but in general. And that relate to our variable compensation. With that I want to ask David to take the KPI overall metric that you're requesting.
David H. Knopf - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Sure. Thanks, Bernardo. I think a couple data points that I think Bernardo said earlier on the call. On a global basis, more than half of our categories are consumption growth in Q3, okay?
And the second point to point out, I think a particular relevance in the U.S. Our categories are going through a trend then with aggregate consumption across our categories improving nearly two percentage points in Q3 versus Q2, which obviously excludes the one-off impact of nuts that we've talked about.
But we've seen a sequential improvement both in measured channels, and as Paulo pointed, overall consumption. But on a global basis, more than half of our categories saw consumption growth in the quarter. Paulo, I don't know...
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio - The Kraft Heinz Co.
I can comment more about the U.S. What we can see is that in the first half we were losing and pretty much the same happened in 2017, we are losing around 0.6% share in our – across the portfolio.
In Q3, we reduced this to 0.3%. And if we exclude the nuts business that we are lapping shipments since July, this number would go around 0.1%. So it's a significant improvement in share performance that we see in – moving – when we move through the year.
David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you very much.
Bernardo Vieira Hees - The Kraft Heinz Co.
And Rob, just to complement on that, I think that what makes us actually positive about what's coming because you see consumption and share in most parts of the world really improving behind the commercial initiatives and the investments, right?
Where the results representing now and we believe they can be sustainable in the coming months and quarters, we'll continue to see acceleration in share, in volumes and in the commercial performance in general.
David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you.
Christopher M. Jakubik - The Kraft Heinz Co.
Thanks, everyone. I think we'll stop it there. For anybody with follow-up questions, Andy Larkin and myself will be available and anybody in the media with follow-up questions, Michael Mullen will be available.
So thanks very much for joining us. And have a great evening.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a solid quarter, and our community and business continue to grow quickly. 2.3 billion people now use Facebook every month, and 1.5 billion every day. Revenue grew 33% year over year to $13.7 billion.
Last quarter, for the first time, we also shared the number of people who use at least one of our apps each month. We believe this is a better way to measure our community over time because so many people use more than one of our apps. There are now more than 2.6 billion people using Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger each month, up from around 2.5 billion last quarter. But now, on average, more than 2 billion people use at least one of our services every day.
Today, I want to talk about our strategy overall as we navigate challenges and opportunities on several fronts. For one, we're seeing the way people connect shifting to private messaging and stories. We have great products here that people love, but it will take some time for our business to catch up to our community growth.
Two, we're seeing video grow dramatically across the ecosystem. And while Watch is now growing very quickly, we're well behind YouTube and still working to make this a unique people-centric experience. Three, we continue to face increased safety and security threats. We've significantly improved our systems here, but we have more to do.

So let's start with messaging and stories. Public sharing will always be very important, but people increasingly want to share privately too, and that includes both just smaller audiences with messaging and ephemerally with stories. People feel more comfortable being themselves when they know their content will only be seen by a smaller group and when their content won't stick around forever. Messaging and stories make up the vast majority of growth in the sharing that we're seeing.
On messaging specifically, we think we've built the best messaging apps in the world. People now send around 100 billion messages each day using our services that even our second most popular service, Messenger, has a higher daily message volume than SMS had globally at its peak. And this isn't just text. People share more photos, videos and links on WhatsApp and Messenger than they do on social networks.
We are leading in most countries, but our biggest competitor by far is iMessage. And in important countries like the U.S., where the iPhone is strong, Apple bundled iMessage as a default texting app and it's still ahead. In countries where there's more competition between iOS and Android, like much of Europe, people tend to prefer our services.
Now, it's worth noting that one of the main reasons people prefer our services, especially WhatsApp, is because of its stronger record on privacy. WhatsApp is completely end-to-end encrypted, does not store your messages and doesn't store the keys to your messages in China or anywhere else. And this is important because if our systems can't see your messages, then that means that governments and bad actors won't be able to access them through us either.
Our roadmap focuses on continuing to make WhatsApp and Messenger even simpler, faster and adding basic utility features like payments. We found that every time we make our services faster and simpler, people communicate more. We'll also keep pushing our messaging services to be more private and secure, and we believe this will continue to be a competitive advantage for us.
On the business side of messaging, our first step has been to enable people to connect with businesses organically in ways they find useful, and then the second step is to give businesses additional paid tools to increase those interactions. We're well into step one at this point, with more than 3 million accounts on WhatsApp Business. We'll begin step two with a couple of products, paid messaging and ads in Stories.
And by making businesses pay to send messages, we believe it will make them more selective with what they send. Payments will make each of these services more useful for people and businesses, even though we don't plan to profit from it directly. I'll update with more progress on each of these efforts in the next few quarters.
On Stories, we are even better-positioned. People now share more than 1 billion stories every day. We lead in almost every country. There are a couple of reasons we've focused on building Stories in all of our apps. First, I just think that this is the future. People want to share in ways that don't stick around permanently, and I want to make sure that we fully embrace this.
Second, Stories is a medium like feeds that can feel very different in very different contexts. So just like most major social apps have feeds, including Pinterest, Twitter, or LinkedIn, but you wouldn't say that those services do the same things, I think many services will have Stories in the future too, but will serve different functions.
Now, while this effort is going well, we're also working through a couple of challenges here. One is that while WhatsApp Status and Instagram Stories immediately took off and have been huge successes, Facebook Stories started off slower. It's now growing quickly and I think we'll be in a better position soon, but our effort to shift Facebook from News Feed first to Stories first hasn't been as smooth as I had hoped. But this is important for the Facebook community long term.

Another challenge is that we're earlier in developing our ads products for Stories, so we don't make as much money from them yet as we do from feed ads. We're following our normal playbook here of building out the best consumer products first and focusing on succeeding there before ramping up ads. I'm optimistic that we'll get ads in Stories to perform as well as feed over time, and that the opportunity will be even bigger because it looks like Stories will be a bigger medium than feed has been.
But I want to be up front that even assuming that we get to where we want to go from a feed-only world to a feed plus Stories world, it will take some time and our revenue growth may be slower during that period like it was while transitioning our products to mobile.
Now, talking about messaging and Stories raises the question of what's the future of our feed product and the Facebook app overall. On feed specifically, people continue to use them heavily and we don't expect that to decrease. From a business perspective, feeds will drive the majority of our growth over the next couple of years, at least until Stories become an even bigger driver.
On the Facebook app overall, what we see is that we are generally stable, although we may be close to saturated in developed countries while we continue to grow quickly in developing countries. For a few years, we saw a trend where people's time was increasing primarily because they were consuming more video and public content, even as they interacted with friends and family less. But people were telling us what they wanted was to interact with people more. So we didn't think that this trend was sustainable.
We've made a number of changes this year to focus the product on meaningful social interactions, and those generally seem to be working. That means the trends in how people are interacting have improved, even though we've purposefully reduced time spent on things like lower-quality viral videos and news to achieve this.
While there's a lot to do to improve News Feed, our roadmap for the Facebook app is very focused on a few priorities: Stories, which we've discussed; video, which I'll get to in a moment; and a much bigger focus on communities and groups.
If the last 10 years have been about friends and family, then the next 10 years will be about your communities as well. When we say communities, we mean both helping people connect with people who share their interests, which is a major need in people's lives, and also building out specific services for bringing people closer together, like helping you find someone to date, or find a job, or buy and sell things, or grow your small business, or create an event, or start fundraisers, or bring together a group to volunteer.
A lot of these services are growing quickly. Hundreds of millions of people now belong to meaningful communities that are a central part of their social support structure. Marketplace is now used by 800 million people and is emerging as one of the most popular places to buy vehicles online. On jobs, our new tool has helped people find more than 1 million jobs. On fundraisers, in the last year we've helped people raise more than $300 million for charities on their birthdays alone. And I'm looking forward to rolling out dating across the world soon too.
These are services that generally benefit from having everyone you know connected on a single platform. And while people may not spend as much time on some of these tools as they do in News Feed, these are very high-value activities for our community.
Now, we're seeing a similar dynamic in Instagram, where there's still a lot to improve in feed, but we're increasingly focused on other experiences as well. But in Instagram, instead of focusing on communities, we're very focused on helping you explore your interests. So this will take the form of IGTV, which I'll discuss more in a minute, plus new shopping experiences and really building out Explore. These areas have huge potential for serving our community and a lot of potential for businesses as well. For example, Explore is already about 20% of the time that people spend in Instagram. But unlike feed, we haven't built any ads experience for it yet, so that's an opportunity.

Now, I want to discuss what we're seeing with video specifically, since it's such an important and growing area. Our efforts here have grown, but we've had challenges reconciling all this passive video consumption with what people uniquely want from us, which is meaningful social interaction.
Video has grown a lot on our services, but as I mentioned earlier, we hit a dynamic where when it grows in feeds in Facebook and Instagram, it displaces some social interactions, and people tell us it makes the experience less valuable even though they're spending more time on it.
So the solution to this has been building separate video experiences outside of our feeds with Watch on Facebook and IGTV on Instagram. And what we found is that when people seek out video experiences intentionally, they don't displace social interactions as much, and the quality of the experience is generally higher. We've also been able to build experiences that help creators build communities around their content, which fits our mission and our focus to encourage meaningful interactions.
At this point, Watch has really hit its stride and it's growing incredibly quickly, about 3x in the last few months in the U.S. alone. IGTV is still earlier in its development, but I think we have a good sense of how to make it work as well. To be clear, these services are still well behind YouTube, which is our primary competitor in this space, but they're growing very quickly.
Now, that said, beyond the mission challenges of video displacing social interactions, there is also a business challenge, which is that video monetizes significantly less well per minute than people interacting in feeds. So this means that even though we've made video more community-oriented and minimized displacement of social interactions, as video grows, it will still displace some other services where we'd probably make more money.
From a mission and a business perspective, though, we still believe this is the right thing to do. Video is a critical part of the future. It's what our community wants as long as we can make it social, and I think will end up being a large part of our business as well.
All right, next I want to talk about safety and security. So let me start by saying that last month, we had a serious security issue. Our teams did well to find and close the vulnerability quickly, but we have a long road ahead to prevent these kinds of attacks in the future. Over the last couple years, though, we've done a lot of work and made a lot of progress. We still have at least a year before our systems are at the level that we want, but they're getting better every day, and that's both technology and people.
Our systems for proactively identifying harmful content are improving. Our systems for detecting interference in elections are a lot more mature now. The upcoming elections will be a real test of the protections we've put in place. With a community of more than 2 billion people, we will see all the good and bad that humanity can do. And we will never be perfect, but I'm proud of the work that we're doing here.
We've reduced the incentives to spread misinformation. We're partnering more closely with governments and outside experts to improve security, including here in the U.S. And we set a new standard for transparency in advertising. This quarter alone, we've found and taken down foreign influence campaigns from Russia and Iran attempting to interfere in the U.S., UK, Middle East, and elsewhere, as well as groups in Brazil that have been active in their own country. We still have a lot of work to do in all of these areas that I've talked about.
News Feed continues to be very important. We're building the best messaging and stories and community tools in the world. Our video services are getting better and growing quickly, and we still have a lot of work to do on safety. And we're also heavily investing in AR and VR, as well as hardware for bringing people closer together, like Portal for video presence and Oculus Quest, the all-in-one VR experience that delivers rift like quality with no wires attached.

So with all of this ahead, I expect 2019 to be another year of significant investment. Dave will say more about this in a moment, but I want you to know that looking out beyond 2019, I know that we need to make sure our costs and revenue are better matched over time; and that's something that I'm focused on as well.
So, overall, this has been an important year. It's been a tough year, but we've built products that I'm proud of and we've made a lot of progress on some of our hardest issues. As always, I appreciate your support. And thank you for being a part of this journey with us.
And now, here is Sheryl.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Hi, everyone.
It was another good quarter for our business, with ad revenue up 33% year over year. Our growth was broad-based across regions, marketer segments and verticals. Mobile ad revenue grew 40% to $12.5 billion, making up approximately 92% of our total ad revenue. Since Facebook launched its first ad products, we've been in the business of growing our clients' businesses, from the largest brands in the world, to the entrepreneur in her living room.
Over 90 million businesses rely on Facebook pages to reach potential customers for free. In a global survey, half of small businesses with a presence on Facebook said that they are hiring because of growth they're able to achieve through our platform. More than 6 million advertisers are active across Facebook, Instagram and our other services. With more than 2 billion people using at least one of our services every day, we're the best place for these advertisers to show people ads that work.
We know that our continued growth depends upon maintaining the trust of the people who use our services and earning our clients' business each and every day in a very competitive environment. Every time I meet with clients, I tell them that we want to be the best minute and the best dollar, euro or peso they spend. As we look ahead to 2019 and beyond, we're focused on continuing to build our clients' businesses and ours by helping advertisers reach consumers where they are and making ads better.
First, helping advertisers connect with people where they are. Consumers often adopt new technologies before businesses do. Our competitive advantage is helping advertisers close that gap. We've done this before on desktop, mobile and News Feed. In the early days, we helped businesses deliver personalized marketing at scale on desktop. With the shift to mobile, we've helped companies large and small build their mobile presence.
Now, we're doing it again with stories, messaging, Marketplace and Watch. Today, the primary way advertisers are reaching people on our services is through Facebook News Feed and Instagram Feed. Feed ads on Facebook and Instagram represent the majority of our revenue growth and the majority of opportunities for marketers to generate ROI.
Quarter after quarter, we make improvements that help advertisers use feed ads to launch new products, find new customers, build awareness and increase sales, all in a highly efficient way. We're always working to enable more marketers to achieve their goals through mobile feed, and we see continued opportunity here going forward.
At the same time, as Mark mentioned, more and more consumers are using stories and private messaging in addition to the time they spend in News Feed and Instagram Feed. Because our services share a common platform, advertisers can use the same tools to buy across all our ad services.
Building on the strength of ads and Instagram Stories, we rolled out ads in Facebook Stories in Q3 and announced plans to introduce ads in WhatsApp Status next year. We know it's not enough to make a new format available. We also need to make it easy for advertisers to optimize their campaigns.

In Q3, we improved how ads from News Feed look in Stories. This is important for advertisers like Pandora, which uses Facebook and Instagram to reach potential listeners. Previously, they would buy Instagram Story ad separately and develop unique creative each time. Now, with automatic placements, our technology converts their horizontal video and captions from Facebook into a design that looks native to the vertical Instagram Stories format. For Pandora, this resulted in a 10% lower cost per view than their stand-alone campaigns simply by checking a box in our ad tool.
When it comes to messaging, we have an opportunity to help people and businesses connect in ways that are valuable for both. On Messenger, over 10 billion messages are sent between people and businesses every month. It's still early, but we're exploring how we can help advertisers reach people in Messenger through sponsored messages and inbox ads.
For WhatsApp, we're growing our business ecosystem starting with the WhatsApp Business model app on Android. In August, we launched the WhatsApp Business API to help larger companies send useful information such as boarding passes or delivery confirmations. This paid messaging model will ensure that companies are selective about what they send and don't clutter people's chats. As always, people will be able to block any business they want with one tap. As we build the business on WhatsApp, we're determined to maintain the simple private user experience that people love.
That's also true for Marketplace and Watch. Last year, we started allowing advertisers to extend their News Feed ads to Marketplace, helping businesses reach people where they already shop. In Q3, we expanded Marketplace ads to nearly 70 marketers. It's early days, but advertisers are seeing good results.
With Facebook Watch, we've been working closely with advertisers to better fit their current planning and buying process for video. In Q3, we introduced a way for advertisers to buy video placements from a selection of the most engaging publishers, choose specific content categories they want their ads to play alongside, and pay only for ads that are watched to the end. Again, it's still early, but we're pleased with advertiser interest and results so far.
We have a big opportunity to help our large and growing advertiser base expand to new platforms and formats to reach potential customers. Our service makes it possible for every business to access the same tools as the largest brands. We start by making it simple for small businesses to transition from using our consumer apps to using our business tools, and then we make it easy to run more sophisticated campaigns.
This has been true every step of our journey so far, from online to mobile and now for messaging and stories. In the future, this will include opportunities with the new VR/AR platforms that we're creating as well.
We're also focused on making ads better. One of the top things people tell us about our ads is that they want them to be relevant. We create value for people when we show ads they are likely to find useful, for advertisers when we deliver ads to the right audience, and for our own business by performing this match effectively.
Our business model is and always has been to connect people and businesses with relevant marketing messages without sharing people's personal information. Protecting people's privacy is incredibly important because people and businesses will only use our services if they feel Facebook can be trusted and if sharing on our platform is safe. That's why we're making significant ongoing investments to better protect privacy and security.
In Q3, we completed the shutdown of partner categories and tightened our standards for Custom Audiences. These changes help protect peoples' privacy and ensure that advertisers have more oversight of the information they use for advertising. We also continue to invest heavily in technology and people to remove bad content as quickly as possible and prevent it from going up in the first place, while giving advertisers more control over where their ads are placed.

This quarter, we added more tools for advertisers to see where their ads might appear in Audience Network, Instant Articles and instream placements like Watch. They can block their ads from running in videos or articles from certain publishers or categories of content and review all of their placements at the end of each campaign.
Making ads better also means increasing efficiency for advertisers. In Q3, we expanded campaign budget optimization so advertisers of all sizes can now set a single budget, and our system automatically finds the best opportunities across each of those segments. Improvements like this one add up and help businesses maximize the value they're gaining from our products over time. This is critical for small businesses that don't have large advertising budgets or expertise, and it's an important way we support economic growth and job creation around the world.
As we wrap up the year, I want to thank our clients for their partnership and their continued feedback which helps us improve. And I also want to thank our teams at Facebook for helping these businesses reach their customers and grow.
And now, here is Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with our community metrics. Daily active users on Facebook reached 1.49 billion, up 9% compared to last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. This number represents approximately 66% of the 2.27 billion monthly active users in Q3. MAUs were up 199 million or 10% compared to last year.
Note that our Q3 2018 community metrics reflect an update to our calculation methodology. This resulted in the removal of the small percentage of accounts or approximately 15 million DAU and 9 million MAU worldwide. This change will modestly impact our year-over-year user growth rates until we lap it next year. Further details are included in the earnings slides on our IR website.
Turning now to the financials, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q3 revenue was $13.7 billion, up 33% or 34% on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant compared to last year, Q3 total revenue would have been $159 million higher.
Q3 total ad revenue was $13.5 billion, up 33% or 35% on a constant currency basis. In terms of regional ad growth, Asia Pacific was strongest at 38%, followed by Europe and North America at 34% and 33%, respectively. Rest of world ad growth trailed at 26% due to both currency weakness and economic challenges in Latin America.
Mobile ad revenue was $12.5 billion, up 40%, and represented approximately 92% of total ad revenue. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 7% and the number of ad impressions served across our services increased 25%, driven primarily by feed ads on Instagram and Facebook.
Our impression growth in Q3 came primarily from product surfaces and geographies that monetize at relatively lower rates. For example, ads in Instagram Stories contributed to our impression growth this quarter, although these ads currently monetize at lower rates compared to feed ads. Payments and other fees revenue was $188 million, up 1%.
Turning now to expenses. Total expenses were $7.9 billion, up 53%. We ended Q3 with approximately 33,600 full-time employees. That's up 45%. The majority of our new hires in the past year have been in technical functions. Operating income was $5.8 billion, representing a 42% operating margin. Our Q3 tax rate was 13%. This was lower than we expected because we did not take the one-time charge that we anticipated due to the Ninth Circuit Court withdrawing its decision in the Altera case.
Net income was $5.1 billion or $1.76 per share. Capital expenditures were $3.3 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. In Q3, we generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with approximately $41.2 billion in cash and investments. In the third quarter, we bought back approximately $4.3 billion of our Class A common stock.

Turning now to the revenue outlook, in Q4, we expect that our total revenue growth rate will decelerate by a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to our Q3 total revenue growth rate. Several factors are contributing to this deceleration. First, we expect more of our impression growth to continue to come from product services and geographies that monetize at lower rates. Second, we are seeing some impact from data privacy initiatives on pricing growth. And third, as we focus more of our product efforts on the growth of Stories, its more prominent placement on Facebook will displace some ad impression opportunities.
Turning now to the expense outlook, we anticipate our full-year 2018 total expenses will grow approximately 50% to 55% versus our prior range of 50% to 60%. We anticipate that full-year 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $14 billion to $14.5 billion compared to our prior estimate of $15 billion.
Turning to tax, at current stock prices, we expect that our Q4 tax rate will be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, fluctuations in our stock price will impact our tax rate.
I'd also like to share our initial outlook on 2019 operating expenses and CapEx. As Mark mentioned, we plan to continue to invest aggressively across the business and expect that full-year 2019 total expenses will grow 40% to 50% compared to full-year 2018. We also expect that full-year 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $18 billion to $20 billion, driven by a continuation of our data center build strategy that seeks to put in place adequate capacity ahead of our needs. We anticipate that our full-year 2019 tax rate will be in the mid-teens.
The third quarter marked a period of both solid revenue growth across the globe and heavy investment as we make progress on our mission to bring the world closer together. We are confident in our ability to improve the products that our community loves as well as to provide innovative new experiences in the near and long-term.
And with that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask two. First for Mark, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of the challenges that you see for Stories within Facebook relative to their stronger adoption in Instagram and for WhatsApp Status. And then also, what if Stories don't gain traction on Facebook over time here? How do you think about that for the platform as well?
And then, secondly, for Dave, just on OpEx for 2019, the 40% to 50% growth, should we think about that as still the same buckets of spend that you've been talking about over the last year or so, and does their prioritization change at all for next year? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, so I can take the first part. I think a lot of this is really basic. When I say that we got started slower on Facebook, that starts with literally rolling out on Facebook a number of months after we had rolled out on either WhatsApp or Instagram. And then the initial version of what we shipped I just think wasn't as high-quality as where it needed to be. It wasn't as fast. There were bugs. And we've been working on dialing that in.
I'm less worried at this point about it not working because we're starting to see it really take off. Certainly, with different groups of people, it's stronger on Instagram or WhatsApp or Facebook, but across all three at this point, it's growing. And as I said in my opening remarks, I think we're going to be a lot better positioned here in Facebook in the next year.

David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Hey, Doug. It's Dave. Just on the 2019 expense growth guide, a lot of that is consistent with what we've been talking about as our big investment areas. If you look at just head count growth in the past year, it's up 45%. So that compensation expense base that we're bringing into 2019 is really factoring into the overall growth guidance for the total expense guide, so that's a big factor there.
In addition, we've been investing significantly in CapEx, and those investments are starting to flow through the P&L in terms of depreciation. And then I'd point to significant investment areas like AR/VR efforts, the content ecosystem around video, and the ongoing investment in safety and security.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you so much, maybe one for Sheryl. When you think about some of the friction points you're trying to solve for on either the creative side or the selling-through side with respect to video and Stories, maybe you could call out some of the conversations you're having with advertisers and how you see some of the moves Facebook can make to solve for those friction points looking out to 2019 and beyond. Thanks so much.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks for the question. We have a very large and growing advertiser base, and that gives us we think a really strong position to get people into new formats. When you do that, a couple of things really matter. One is that the format of an ad really has to match the format of the consumer experience. So the right ad in News Feed is different than the right ad in an Instagram or a Facebook story is different than the right ad in Watch, which would be video-only. And so making these new formats of ads is actually hard for people and expensive. And so we're working hard on tools to make the formats easier, and I talked about one of those examples before.
What's nice is that the same targeting, the same measurement systems really work. Because we are looking to show relevant ads to the right person at the right time, the systems we have that understand in a privacy-protected way what ads people are likely to be more interested in, those work, whether you're in Stories or Watch or Instagram Feed or News Feed.
And the other thing is that our systems for measuring the effectiveness of ads, which help advertisers get all the way through to their ROI, which help them bid in our system, also work. And so we take the advertiser base, we take the systems we have for targeting and measuring ads, and then we help advertisers move to the new format. And I think that's the process we're on.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, last quarter, Dave, you made some comments about a multiyear margin outlook, and I appreciate the comment this quarter about engagement in the feed, et cetera. I was just curious when you thought about that margin outlook, how do you think about the one or two key drivers of News Feed monetization over the next few years, given you expect to be flat overall engagement?
And then secondly on Watch, I'm wondering, Mark. Could you just talk about the key one to two steps you need to sort of clear in order to drive higher Watch and video engagement to sort of catch up with some of the competitors? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Hey, Brian. It's Dave. In terms of what we're seeing as opportunities, I mean, we continue to see good growth opportunities for revenue across both Facebook and Instagram, including both feed and Stories. I think in terms of impression growth, you're going to have more opportunities in Stories, probably more opportunity on Instagram, but good revenue growth opportunities in both places. So that's obviously what we're looking for when we look forward. Beyond that, I don't have much to update on in terms of any more specific revenue outlook.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
And to the video questions, the biggest thing that we need to do is make sure that the video experience is people-centric and that we're helping creators build community and we're helping people interact with each other. Our journey with video has been a little bit funny, in that people really want to watch a lot of video. And to a large degree, we've had to limit its growth and we had to do the things so we can stop limiting it.
The things that have caused us to limit it are, on the one hand, when we see passive consumption of video displacing social interactions, that's not something that we've wanted because we feel like that's what Facebook is. We build social products that help people interact. There are lots of places in the world that you can go to consume content, but we're the Internet service that people use to help connect with other people and we're not going to let passive consumption get in the way of that.
So we needed to figure out a way so that video can grow, but people can also keep on interacting doing what they tell us that they uniquely want from Facebook. And now, I think we're starting to work through what the formula is going to be so we can take some of those rate limits off and let video grow at the rate it wants to. And I think that's a very exciting opportunity ahead, and that's one of the reasons that I'm very optimistic about the Watch growth that we've started to see recently up about 3x in the last few months in the U.S. alone.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Mark, first, on Facebook engagement. There are some questions about usage. And when you look at the engagement, do you see it stable? I think you mentioned that earlier. And does that include some of the changes you've made on video earlier in the year?
And then, secondly, some usage may be moving over to Instagram. When you look at Facebook plus Instagram, how do you feel about how that usage is trending? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So I mean across the whole family of apps, I mean all of this engagement is growing quickly and we're very happy with how we're enabling people to share. As I said, the vast majority or the majority of the growth that we're seeing in sharing is coming from private messaging and story sharing. So that's kind of the big thing.
The basic story that we've seen within the Facebook app is, over the last few years, the amount of time that people were spending in the app was increasing primarily because people were consuming more public content, like passive video consumption and news. But it was coming at the expense of people interacting with each other as much. So interactions were down. And we got a lot of feedback from people saying that's not what they wanted.
We don't think that that's what we're uniquely here to do. It's not the mission of the company. So we felt like that was not sustainable. So we've made a lot of shift this year, which I've talked a lot about on a bunch of these calls, to encourage more meaningful social interactions instead. And we have seen that those changes have improved the trajectory of how people are interacting.
Now, at the same time that we have intentionally reduced time spent on certain things, like lower-quality viral videos, some news, some passive content, but that's what I was talking about before when I said that now the trend – and you can kind of look at it in developed markets and developing. In developed markets, it is stable and we feel like we're pretty close to saturation in a lot of countries, like the U.S. And in developing countries, where a lot of people are still getting on the Internet, it continues to grow at a fast rate. And we think that there's a lot more connecting in community that people want there.

So that's kind of what we're seeing overall. Across the whole family, I would say it's very positive. On Facebook overall, I feel like we have a handle on what the drivers of this are and we're kind of driving it to be what people tell us they want and what we think is going to be sustainable over time. That's the picture that we have.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Two questions. Dave, you mentioned 4Q revenue is going to have a mid to high-single digit deceleration. That's a tad better than what you stated 90 days ago. So just I know it's a small change, but I think folks on the line are looking for anything incremental in terms of what you're seeing. Has anything improved? And then, any initial read on what kind of deceleration we can expect to see in 2019, if at all, as you start turning on the ads on WhatsApp?
And then, one for Sheryl. The shopping experience on Instagram, how do you compare, I guess, just the overall commercial intent on Instagram compared to Facebook? And what do you think that says about the long-term monetization potential for Instagram versus Facebook?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
All right. Ross, I'll start off on that. I think the outlook that we're giving for Q4 deceleration is broadly consistent with the outlook that I gave last quarter with the benefit of a little bit more visibility. I'd just reiterate the points that I'd made in the earnings script around what's driving that deceleration.
And as far as to how that plays into 2019, we're not providing a specific revenue outlook for 2019. We continue to see good growth opportunities across the platform on both Facebook and Instagram and feed and Stories. Those are going to be the drivers. I would characterize the launch of Status apps on WhatsApp as being a much smaller thing than a driver of 2019 revenue growth, and it's going to be more about Instagram and Facebook. The same factors that I discussed impacting Q4 growth will likely continue to play out to some extent in 2019, but we've got a lot of good growth opportunities for next year.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
When you look at the Instagram Shopping experience, we're seeing some really nice growth. We have 90 million people tap to reveal product tags and posts every month to learn more about them, and we're putting real investments behind this. In Q3, we rolled out Shopping in Stories globally and began testing the Shopping Channel in Explore. And so, we think the opportunities are big.
As you think about commercial intent in Facebook versus Instagram, there's so much activity on both. We think there's a lot of opportunity for people to have commercial intent, if not have it when they start, but develop it because they see things they're interested in, in both. Instagram can be more interest-based in some places than Facebook. So there are places in Instagram like Fashion or like Shopping that have very high signal, and that gives us I think a very strong opportunity there.

Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Two questions, if I can. First, just, Mark, your comments in prepared remarks on Stories having potential to be a bigger medium than News Feed suggests that the engagement is a net positive in terms of time spent or sessions per user. Is that the right way to interpret that as you see people engage in this they actually spend more time overall?
And then, second question for Dave. Last quarter, you guided to kind of long-term operating margins in the mid-30s range. The guidance on OpEx for next year kind of implies we may already be there. Is that the right interpretation and should we expect it to be kind of stable beyond that based on some of the comments from Mark about recognizing that revenue and costs should be matched over the long-term? Any help you could give there would be great.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So on Stories, I don't know if we've given any metrics on time spent or anything on that side. But what I can say is that all of the trends that we've seen suggests that in the not too distant future people will be sharing more into Stories than they will into feeds, and that the whole market across all of the Stories type of products will be bigger in a market where people are sharing more moments from their days into Stories-type products than into feed-type products.
And this happened very quickly, right? I mean this whole trend is much newer than the trend with News Feed and feeds overall and it continues to grow incredibly quickly. So we just see that there is a lot of upside there.
Now, on the flip side, I try to be very careful in my remarks to be clear that this is one of those situations where the community growth that we're seeing is outpacing the progress that we've made so far on developing the ads in that space. And I think we'll get there over time, where the performance for Stories ads will converge with what we have seen in feed. And I think that the opportunity will be bigger because there will be more in Stories – or more Stories overall than in feed. But I can't tell you just yet what that timeframe is going to look like, but I think we're well-positioned over the long-term because we're leading in Stories in basically every country.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And, Lloyd, on the margin question, as I mentioned, 2019 will be a big investment year. So I would expect us to have the biggest change in our margin structure to happen in 2019 and for it to moderate from there. It's hard to be too prescriptive about 2020 and beyond, but I think the biggest change will be 2019.

Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Just on Europe, there's been a more pronounced deceleration. Just curious in terms of how you think about the stabilization there going forward in your model and maybe a little more color on the pricing.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Brent. It's Dave. I think, I guess, if you're talking about DAU and MAU, Europe is stable on that front in terms of Facebook overall. The accounting methodology change did affect how Europe sequential growth rate came in, but really stable if you kind of take that aside. And we had some impact from GDPR over the last two quarters. So I think, from that perspective, it is broadly stable for Facebook there.
European growth rate I think was healthy from a revenue point of view. So I think we're still seeing good growth in Europe on the revenue front, and a lot of the similar dynamics playing out in Europe as in the rest of the world where you see good impression growth opportunity, especially in areas like Instagram and Stories contributing to overall ability to drive revenue growth.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. You seem confident that Stories will ultimately be a more effective canvas both for users and businesses and maybe even more so than the feed, but you also talked the transitional challenges. What specifically are those challenges? And since Instagram is further along with Stories, are there any things you're seeing with Instagram Stories monetization that gives you line of sight to reaching monetization parity, not only at Instagram, but also at core Facebook eventually?
And then maybe just a second one. In addition to Stories, Mark also discussed how private messaging is also a growth use case. In private messaging, the company has, understandably so, been cautious on the monetization side. So just curious if you could discuss how optimistic you are about building a meaningful business around private messaging.

Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
I can take those. When you think about the transition or people using feed versus Stories, there are a couple of things that are different. One is just the format. And again, we have a lot of experience at this. People had display ads or search ads before they really did Facebook ads, if you look back a decade. And teaching people here is what a Facebook ad looks like was a new format people had to understand. Then, as we moved into more photos with Instagram, more videos, a video ad on Facebook or Instagram is a very different thing if they perform well. They need to be natively social than a video ad that runs on TV.
So Stories is a new format. It has multiple pictures, multiple screens, words and phrases intermixed in a different way. And so again, that's a new muscle for advertisers. I think we're getting people up the curve well this time. We've learned that we can't just rely on teaching our clients and teaching the ad agencies to do it, but helping them do that. And so some of the tools we've rolled out that I talked about where we can take your Facebook pictures and your posts and make it a story, that makes that process faster.
I think when you think about the long-term monetization opportunities, it's really going to depend upon the time people spend. The amount of ads we would feel comfortable inserting into a consumer experience really depends upon how many different things you go through. So if you spend more time in Stories, they'll be need to be more engaging because there will be fewer ads in there.
Now that may be possible because there's high, high, high engagement in Stories. So we're going to have to see the length and how quickly people scroll through them to see how many ad opportunities there are and to see how effective those ad opportunities are. Our business depends upon the amount of ads that we can share and the effectiveness of those ads, which drives up ROI and ultimately the price.
When you think about messaging, if we've already made the transition in a big way to feed, if we are starting to see real success in Stories, messaging is in a much earlier stage. And what we're doing on Messenger and on WhatsApp are really making sure that businesses can connect with people, and then in the early stages of testing messaging. So we think paid messaging, as we've talked about.
And WhatsApp is interesting because by virtue of paying, businesses are going to have to be careful about the content they send. You're not going to send a lot of things people don't want to see if you're paying for them. And so really focused on the consumer experience there and figuring out over time.
The last thing I'll say is that I think these things are more connected than people realize, in the sense that we're already seeing some nice traction with click-to-Messenger ads. So one of the things advertisers are trying to do when they're in feed and ultimately when they're in Stories is drive to transactions and real engagement, one-on-one with a consumer is often part of that.
So a click-to-Messenger ad takes advantage of having both of those platforms so that businesses can deepen their relationship with the consumer. And I think those experiences and the interaction between them, we're even in earlier days there, but I think we have a lot of opportunity to explore there.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And, Mark, this is Dave. I just wanted to add in. I think you asked about line of sight on monetization parity on Stories versus feed. It's obviously hard to say that because they're both dynamic, they're auctions, there's a lot going on. But I would say that at least in the near term, the impression growth opportunity is significant on Stories. Pricing will take time. So as we bring more formats to Stories and bring more advertisers to Stories, we can build up that demand and balance that out with supply. But I think in terms of it converging on feed from any pricing perspective, that's a journey that's going to take years, not quarters. So it's going to take time.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Evercore.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Thank you very much for taking my question. Just really one for Mark, which is, I don't think anyone has asked much about the security investments that Facebook is making. And when I talk to investors, people are curious whether it's one-off or recurring. And so as you think about 2019, the magnitude of the resources that the company plans to deploy to protect privacy, to protect security, it sounds like you're in or will be in, hopefully, a better position to ward off bad actors than you were prior to the 2016 election.
But I just wonder. Do you look at this as an endless arms race, or is there some point in this investment where you might be able to get some better efficiencies on those investments, also relative to others in the industry who are making investments that don't seem quite as sizable as Facebook's? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
This is a really important question. I do think that we are up against sophisticated adversaries who will continue to evolve. So there is a large element of this, which is an arms race. And when you're talking about security issues and some of the safety and content issues, these are not problems that we fix. They're problems that you manage over time and try to reduce and prevent issues from coming up, but there's no silver bullet where you do the thing and then you're done.
That said, I do think that we were quite behind where we needed to be a couple of years ago. We started a roadmap, which we said was going to be about a three-year roadmap. I think that we have some confidence in that timeframe, which takes us through the end of about 2019, to get our systems to the level that we generally think that they should be at, where we're building AI systems that can flag content that might be problematic to a much larger security and review team that can manage the larger volume of stuff that our tools are flagging to them.
We're judging our success by, go through all of the categories of harmful content and behavior, whether it's terrorism, or self-harm, or hate speech, or just any different kind of thing that you'd be worried about. We're judging our success by how proactive can we get, so what percent of the stuff that we're taking down are we identifying before other people identify it for us. We've started issuing transparency reports so we can be held publicly accountable on this.
What we see internally is that generally every week and every quarter that goes by, we're getting better and better at this. But I anticipate that it will be about the end of next year when we feel like we're as dialed in as we would generally all like us to be. And even at that point, we're not going to be perfect because more than 2 billion people are communicating on the service. There are going to be things that our systems miss, no matter how well-tuned we are.
But I think we're making progress. We've made a lot of progress in the last couple of years on content overall. Elections are a special case, an extremely important special case of the content and safety issues and security issues that we face. But across all of the different types of content issues of people trying to spread hate or incite violence. We are making progress, and I feel good about the progress that we're making. And I think we will continue investing more. But I do think that to some degree the last few years and next year are probably going to be the biggest growth in the investment in the security efforts that we'll see.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. I just had two questions and I guess maybe you just touched on some of this, Mark. But the CapEx growth that you guys gave for next year, how far ahead should we think about you guys building out capacity? And can you help us think about the ongoing trend, in particular in light of your comments that you just made about how you'll feel about being more dialed in at the end of 2019? But how do we think about kind of that continued growth and CapEx number? And is there anything there that's a one-time item?

And I guess the other question would just be related to Stories. And I guess, I'm just wondering, I know it's early days in terms of advertisers putting ad units in there at this point. But given that you've got the technology that converts to creative and kind of help people with that process of how to do a good Stories ad, how effective do you think that's been in terms of helping to drive their adoption of this ad unit thus far?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Heather, I'll take the first question regarding CapEx. So, yeah, we are investing ahead of user growth, given the long lead time in deploying data centers and network capacity. So we are building some capacity ahead of our immediate needs. So that is playing into it. But we're also making investments to support the core growth of the business. There's a lot of compute that goes behind, things like feed ranking and ads ranking. We think there is good ROI to putting more servers behind things like choosing the right ad for the right impression opportunity that we have. So we are putting more compute behind that.
And then, I'd also make the comment that a lot of our growth is coming from markets in Asia, our top growth countries were India, Indonesia and the Philippines. So we're building capacity to serve that Asian peak and those users are at a lower ARPU. So that impacts the overall capital intensity. So we're continuing to invest and we're seeing increased CapEx in 2019, albeit at a much slower growth rate than we had in 2018.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
I'll talk about Stories and I'll share a fun and, I think, important example. We know that when people are using more of the opportunities to reach consumers, their returns often go up. So the fun example is the Furbo Dog Camera. They're a Taiwanese company. They built this camera where you can see/talk and you can see and talk and toss dog treats to your dog when you're not at home. They ran a video ad campaign across Facebook and Instagram Stories and they targeted people with dog-related interests and used Custom Audiences to exclude people who had already purchased their product. By running across Facebook Stories and Instagram Stories, they drove 20% more leads than our other digital campaigns. So anecdotally, with our early, early adopters, we can see that we believe the increased opportunities here really work, and we have other examples like this.
In terms of how early it is for adoption, it's super early. We just rolled out the ability to do this in August, and we have to drive awareness and drive people into trying it. And even when we make it super easy for people to get their ads into the right format, from the smallest mom-and-pop to the largest brands, people want to understand the creative of their ad and it needs to be in a format they feel comfortable. So as more people use Stories, we think they will increasingly feel comfortable in Stories. But we have a long road ahead of us even with tools that make it easy to drive awareness and adoption. We think once we do, the returns will be good.

Your last question comes from the line of Ralph Schackart from William Blair.
Ralph Edward Schackart - William Blair & Co. LLC
Good afternoon. Maybe switching gears to feed, you talked about it being a major growth driver and a lot of opportunities for improvement. Can you maybe share some perspective on what those opportunities look like from both a user, as well as an advertiser? And then also, maybe just more longer-term, how can feed continue to be a strong growth driver? Thanks.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
I can take that. When you think about feed, what people are doing is sharing. They're sharing in Instagram and Facebook. And that means there's, in many ways, almost limitless opportunity for consumers to do more. I think we've made some strong changes on Facebook in terms of meaningful social interactions, and I think the history of our ability to develop and iterate on consumer products shows that we can help people as they evolve, share the things they want to share, and have a very meaningful and important experience in feed as they're sharing.

Feed is fundamentally about information being pushed to a consumer and us helping figure out what is most interesting and most engaging and I think, in many ways, positive for people. And I think the product teams, led by Mark, have done a great job of that over time and you're seeing the continued investment there. Along with that, goes the advertising opportunities. As there are more Stories and feed, as more people are engaged in Facebook and increasingly in Instagram, that gives us more opportunities just on the supply side of ads.
On the demand side, all of the things we do to get more advertisers active in our system, means we'll have more ads to choose from, to make those ads more relevant, to measure the ROI of those ads so that people can then iterate and, again, make those more relevant. I think we've made real improvements there, but I think there's a lot more we can do.
And one of the ways I talk to people about it is just ask what percentage of the ads do you see in your feed are as good as the very best posts you see from friends. And I think most people will honestly say that certainly compared to a few years ago, those ads are much more relevant to them, but not all of them. And you can see in that example, even in your own feed, the opportunities we have to improve, finding the right ad and giving it to the right person at the right time, which drives businesses all around the world and drives our business as well.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Microchip Technology Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, Eric Bjornholt. Please go ahead, sir.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2018 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Net sales in the December quarter were $994.2 million, modestly higher than the midpoint of our guidance and down 1.8% sequentially from net sales of $1.012 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis gross margins were at the high end of our guidance range of 61.4% in the December quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were at 22% of sales which was a record low and below the low end of our guidance range which was 22.2%. Non-GAAP operating income was a record $391.7 million at 39.4% above the high end of our guidance of 39.2%. Non-GAAP net income was $341.2 million and was up 38.4% as compared to the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.36 which was above the midpoint of our guidance.
On a GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were a record 61.1% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $3.5 million of share-based compensation. Total operating expenses were $361.8 million, and include acquisition and tangible amortization of $121 million, share-based compensation of $20.5 million, $1.2 million of acquisition-related and other costs, and special charges of $0.2 million.

GAAP net income was impacted by a $439.8 million discrete tax event in the quarter primarily associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and we also incurred a loss of $2.1 million on the retirement of our 2037 2.125% convertible bonds. After these adjustments, the GAAP net loss was $251.1 million or $1.07 per diluted share.
The non-GAAP tax rate was 8.5% in the December quarter, and we expect the rate to be about the same in the March quarter. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we expect about $300 million of taxes to be paid over the next eight years related to the tax incurred on foreign earnings that were permanently invested offshore referred to as the transition tax. We estimate the tax payments to be approximately $25 million in years one through five, $45 million in year six, $60 million in year seven and $75 million in year eight. We will continue to evaluate the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and these estimates may change as we complete our analysis.
We are working through the impact of recent U.S. tax reform on Microchip's longer term effective tax rate. There is no impact on the fiscal year 2018 rate as you can see from our March quarter guidance provided in today's earnings release. Excluding the transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we expect our ongoing long-term cash tax rate to be below 9%, which is what we are providing to investors and analysts for cash flow and operating model forecasting purposes. We will continue to refine this over the coming months prior to providing guidance for Q1 of fiscal year 2019.
Moving on to the balance sheet, our inventory balance at December 31, 2017, was $487.1 million. Microchip had 115 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, our targeted inventory levels are between 115 and 120 days. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were at 34 days and up 3 days from the prior quarter, and in the normal historical range for distribution inventory.
The cash flow from operating activities was a record $365 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $1.985 billion, of which about $550 million is domestic cash. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the majority of our offshore cash could be brought back to the U.S. without incurring any material additional tax cost.
We bought back the remaining amount of our 2037, 2.125% convertible bonds in the December quarter through $58.3 million in cash. Capital expenditures were $66.4 million in the December 2017 quarter. We expect about $50 million to $60 million in capital spending in the March quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be about $200 million to $210 million, which is at the lower end of the guidance that we provided last quarter.
We are aggressively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies, and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. These capital investments will bring significant gross margin improvements to our business, particularly for the Atmel manufacturing activities that we are bringing into our own factories.
As mentioned last quarter, our capital spending in fiscal 2018 also reflects three new building projects we are constructing in Arizona, India and Germany, which will give us meaningful lease cost reductions and avoidance in the future, as well as allow us to cost effectively scale our future growth. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $32 million.
We also want to provide an update on the tax treatment of our dividends. In fiscal year 2017, our dividends paid to shareholders were treated as return of capital and we were expecting similar treatment in fiscal year 2018. The tax cuts and Jobs Act which passed in December 2017 has changed this outlook. Due to the U.S. taxation and fiscal year 2018 of our foreign earnings which were historically permanently invested offshore, Microchip is taxable in the U.S. in fiscal year 2018. As a result, dividends in the June September and December 2017 quarters are fully taxable to our shareholders, and dividends to be paid in March 2018 will be fully taxable to our shareholders. We believe the impact of U.S. tax reform on Microchip's U.S. taxable income in future periods will result in dividends being fully taxable to shareholders in fiscal year 2019 and beyond. We will continue to provide updates to shareholders on this topic in the future if facts and circumstances change.

I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. We performed better than we expected in the seasonally slow December quarter with a sequential revenue decline of 1.8% and year-over-year growth of 12.8%, all organic growth as there was no contribution from acquisitions in the last four quarters.
The Microchip 2.0 transformation continues to make good progress especially in terms of new design opportunities as we enable our clients' innovation with the very best smart, connected and secure solutions. Taking a closer look at microcontrollers, our Microcontroller business performed well in the December quarter with revenue down sequentially only 0.6% as compared to the September quarter.
On a year-over-year basis the December quarter Microcontroller revenue was up a very strong 18.9%. 8-bit Microcontroller revenue actually set a new record again, edging out the September quarter performance, while 16-bit and 32-bit revenue continue to have strong year-over-year performances.
Our Microcontroller portfolio and roadmap has never been stronger and we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time. Microcontrollers represent a 66.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter.
Now moving to our Analog business. Our analog revenue was sequentially down 3.2% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, and up 1.5% on a year-over-year basis. As we highlighted at our last conference call, our publicly reported analog results continue to see some revenue classification headwinds resulting from a deliberate shift in strategy we made several quarters ago. The change in product line strategy, as we reported last quarter, is that we have for some time been adding microcontroller cores to several of our more complex analog products, especially those that provide our clients with smart connectivity solutions.
The addition of microcontroller cores to these analog products enables us to sell a higher value and more defensible total system solution. These smart connectivity products are growing nicely, and as they replace older products and new designs, our revenue classification for these new products have shifted from the analog product line to our Microcontroller product line. Transitioning to more sticky and higher margin smart connectivity revenue is the right Microchip answer, but does impact some of the product line reporting that analysts are interested in as some of the revenue growth shifts into our Microcontroller product line.
In the longer term, as the revenue from analog attached design wins continues to ramp, we fully expect that the analog product line revenue will grow nicely. Our analog products represented 23.3% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter.
Moving next to our licensing business. This business was up 6.8% sequentially in the December quarter and up 15.5% on a year-over-year basis, setting a new record in the process. We are seeing the fruits of having licensed several foundries and independent device makers for several years on multiple process technology nodes as they manifest in our results as the license processes ramp volume and generate royalty revenue for many years to come.
Finally, our memory business was sequentially down 7.6% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, and up 3.4% on a year-over-year basis.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business and our guidance going forward. Steve?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2018. I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. Our December quarter financial results were good. Our net sales were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, which itself was slightly better than five years of seasonality. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 61.4% of sales was at the high end of our guidance.

Operating profit of 39.4% of sales made a new all-time record, and earnings per share of $1.36 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.01 per share. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip worldwide for delivering an outstanding quarter and calendar year 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, this was also our 109th consecutive profitable quarter.
Now I will provide you with an update on Microchip 2.0. We are continuing to experience an enormous customer preference to design with our Microcontroller solutions in all 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit customer applications. On top of that, our various acquisitions have now built a powerful diversified product line through which we are able to provide total system solutions to our customers. We are winning incremental design wins with multiple products in the same boards of our customers. We have a robust design win funnel and we feel very optimistic that Microchip 2.0 is working and increasing the organic growth of Microchip.
Based on SIA numbers, our Microcontroller market share in calendar 2017 was at a record 15.7%, up 220 bps from calendar 2016. To be fair, calendar year 2016 only had three quarters of Atmel, while 2017 had all four quarters of Atmel. So I calculated market share for three quarters of 2016 to three quarters of 2017, which will be April 1 to December 31 of both years. Based on that nine-month comparison, our market share gain was 91 bps higher than 2016. Also, our Microcontroller market share grew in each of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit product lines.
Now let us go into the guidance for March quarter. Our inventories at Microchip at the end of December 2017 were 115 days, which is right at our target. We were able to get to this target a quarter or so ahead of what we were thinking. This is due to enormous progress we made on the manufacturing side and bringing capacity online and decreasing lead times.
Our book-to-bill ratio has also continued to moderate from 1.11 in both March 2017 and June 2017 quarters, and then the book-to-bill ratio was 1.05 in September 2017 quarter and 1.0 in December 2017 quarter. This moderation of book-to-bill reflects the improvements in lead times that we have seen or we have been able to achieve over the last several quarters.
As we have indicated before, our seasonality for any given quarter will change as we integrate acquisitions and end up with a new blended seasonality. The seasonality of the Atmel business is driven by a larger percentage of consumer-oriented business, which has a sharper decline in the March quarter. In fact, the historic Atmel seasonality in the March quarter over the five years prior to the acquisition was a 7.8% sequential decline when they were an independent company. Meanwhile, Microchip's historic seasonality in the March quarter in the five years prior to acquiring Atmel was a 2.75% sequential growth. The blended average March seasonality results in a minus 1% sequential decline.
You can also see the contribution from Atmel's consumer business in the stronger than seasonal blended results Microchip experienced in the June, September and December quarters of 2017. We will compare our March quarter guidance to this combined seasonality of new Microchip. So now let's go into the non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We expect total net sales in the March quarter to be down 3% to up 1% sequentially, giving us a midpoint of the guidance at minus 1%, which is right at seasonality that I explained about.
In September quarter last year, our net sales were up 15.8% from a year ago quarter. In December quarter, our net sales were 12.8% from a year ago quarter. In March 2018 quarter, we are guiding the net sales to be up 9% from a year ago quarter, clearly demonstrating the soft landing scenario that we have been talking to the investors. Our total fiscal year 2018 sales ending March 31, 2018 with midpoint of the guidance is expected to be up 13.2% from fiscal year 2017 sales, beating most of our competitors for the same time window.

Regarding gross margin, we see a steady improvement in overall gross margin of the company. Based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers, we expect gross margin for the March quarter to be between 61.3% and 61.7% of sales. We expect overall operating expenses to be between 22% and 22.4% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 38.9% and 39.7% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.39 per share.
I want to remind investors that our long-term financial model is a non-GAAP operating profit of 40% and you have seen that we are relentlessly marching towards this model. Given all the complications of accounting for the acquisitions including amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and inventory write up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track its results on non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to First Call.
With this, operator, will you please pool for questions?
Question-and-Answer Session

Certainly. We'll take our first question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes, thank you. Steve, thanks for the color in terms of book to bill and lead times. When you think through the March quarter seasonality with Atmel/Microchip combined can you help us as you go toward June in terms of what you typically see for the June quarter?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, the June and September were stronger quarters for Atmel as well as for Microchip and you have seen pretty strong June and September quarters for the last couple of years since we have had Atmel in both quarters. And you've seen the December quarter slightly stronger than our historic seasonality as we just reported. And what their results is significant difference in the March quarter seasonality where Microchip was historically up for 2.5% to 2.75%, and Atmel was down a whopping 7.8%. And that's really when you combine it together, that's what results into a minus 1% seasonality.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then maybe just a follow up for Eric. As you approach the target model and given the margin expansion you've seen, can you talk about just some of the initiatives this year and maybe on the intermediate term for both gross margins and op margins?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So, I mean, on the gross margin front it's more of the same of what we've been talking about over the past year in terms of investing and the assembly and test and bringing more of that in-house, and we're making progress on that front. We've deployed a lot of capital over the last couple of quarters, we had more coming in this quarter as we talked about in my prepared remarks on the $50 million to $60 million of capital coming in. So that will continue to add to the gross margin improvement over time.
We've got good utilization in our wafer fabs and all those things are making our cost structure very favorable. At a midpoint of guidance here of about 61.5% gross margin, we've got about a 1% improvement to go to get to the target model, and we're confident that we're going to get there with all these initiatives that we have.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
And same thing on the operating margin, we just reported 39.4%, and our long-term model is 40%. And we're fairly confident that most of that gross margin will fall through and we're going to be in that range.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it.

We'll go next to William Stein with SunTrust.

William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if the inventory build is something that you had expected at the start of the quarter or if that occurred more as a result of perhaps orders not coming in with turn rates as fast as you might have expected when the quarter started?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So the inventory was pretty much right on target what we had guided to and what we achieved. The turns rate in December quarter was not soft. We beat the December quarter from the midpoint of our guidance so I don't think there was any issue in terms of our bookings in December quarter, which will have changed the inventory.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah. And you can see from the guidance that we had on our release, we think we're going to continue to be within our inventory target range of 115 to 120 days in the quarter that we're in right now, so I think inventory is well managed.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
That helps. One follow-up, if I can. You might have mentioned this, and I apologize if I missed it, but you've been talking about supply constraints on the Atmel portfolio, in particular in backend tests, and I think you've noted that you expected to be supply constrained there for – one time you said for the next year, maybe now we're at either six or nine months more. Any update on that relative to the capacity you've been adding. And I see the book-to-bill coming down and lead times coming down. Is that specifically related to the Atmel backend test? And any update there will be helpful. Thank you.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So Atmel had many business units. It was just not one business, it was microcontrollers and memory and defense and aerospace and RF and automotive and wireless and other businesses. We had broad based challenges on the Atmel business, and every quarter certain products, certain business units get help you on that. And we have been guiding from the very beginning that we expect this to take until about June of this year for it to – all business to get healthy and that really hasn't changed.
So as we speak right now, there is largely, I would say, one-and-a-half business units that are still having significant challenges. Most of the others are in the very tail end where a large amount of problems have been resolved. And this last one-and-a-half business unit largely chose the testing platforms to be the one that you cannot acquire any more of. These were very old testers of 1970, 1980 vintage that should have been obsoleted prior to the year 2000. And 20 years later they're still running, but they're not running, they're not running well. And the capacity on them is going down not up because every quarter you've got to take one of it down to use for spare parts because you cannot buy anymore, so therefore the capacity is decreasing not increasing.
So we are bringing that testing up on those products on more modern testers or microchip platforms, but that process is painful and then qualification of customers, many of those are automotive customers. So that is the process we've been going through for the last year-and-a-half, and I think during which we have grown the business, results have been great, lead times have been slowly coming down, but some of the remaining challenges remain and we think we need another five months to get it all behind.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thanks for the details.

We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all, congratulations on a solid quarter. 9% growth is pretty impressive, Steve. I wanted to ask about your outlook for March. In those markets, your broad end markets, auto-industrial consumer, which one do you think is going to outperform, in your opinion, the most?

Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, if the question is just for the March quarter, the consumer, obviously, is the weakest.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Sure.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Automotive should do very well. Industrial should do very well. In some markets you have kind of brand new budgets coming in, in the New Year. The only market that is soft which is driving a minus 1% guidance is because of the Atmel seasonality which is usually down almost 8%, and that is driven by some of the consumer markets. Everything else should be good.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
And maybe I'll add to that on a geographic basis, this will be a strong quarter for Europe. It always is, just many more shipping days in the quarter without the holidays. Asia is the most challenged just because of the Chinese New Year, and Americas should do pretty well.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.
So Steve, as my follow-up, you guys always run the company for the long-term, and historically in lean times even you've grown inventories, your target level of inventory is 115 to 120 days. You just hit 115 days now. By all metrics, end markets are still pretty good. Does it actually make sense for you to – can you make the case that you should actually be growing your inventory levels even further and beyond the 115 days? So why stop here?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, if our inventories get below 100, then we don't have usually all the right product in the right place and all the permutations and combinations and SKUs and permutations and combinations and SKUs and flavors available, and then you go on support and you're expediting and you're going to have a lot of manufacturing challenges. When you are in the 115, 120 days of inventories and I think we can manage our business reasonably well. I mean, I wouldn't distinguish between 115, 120 or a few days left or a few days even more than that on the outer side. But we don't want to have – keep going, like you said, to have 135, 140, 150 days of inventory, because then you're not really making the right use of that inventory.
We don't need that much inventory and you have the opposite risk of obsolescence where certain products, customer changes are flavored. They want to use a different package and we packaged it in and we want to keep most of the inventory and die (00:30:23) inventory. And when you do that, then its dollar value doesn't grow as much versus if you put it in the finished goods.
So I think that's well-tried over the years, that's really the right kind of number. And when we are lower than that, we're trying to grow inventory, when we are higher than that we're trying to decrease inventory, and that's kind of still the right number.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Understood. Thanks, guys, and congrats.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.

We'll go next to Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess to start if you could talk a little bit about where lead times are in general now? You're talking about them coming down. Would you consider them at normal levels now? And just following on from that, Steve, you had talked about the soft landing that you were trying to achieve. You've got lead times down now, you had the book to bill at 1, I mean, would you consider that with what you are seeing now, that soft landing is what we're seeing now or are there are more steps that need to be taken as you go into next year in order to achieve that?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So let me have Ganesh answer the lead time, then I'll pick up on your soft landing question.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.

So lead times are running – if I look at the December quarter in the 4-week to about 14-week window. So if you remember, we had – at the peak of this, we've had between 4 and 20 weeks and we have started out the capacity has come on board as we're able to get our manufacturing to respond. We've been bringing that down and we fully expect that it gets a little bit farther down in the March quarter, maybe closer to about 10, 11 weeks at the top end, and then gets down to between 4 and 8 weeks which is what we would consider to be normal on about 90% of our standard line items by the June quarter, right about on the same timeline we established about a couple of quarters ago.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So picking up on the soft landing scenario, I think I would say we've pretty much demonstrated it. We're on the tail end of it. So March quarter is right at seasonality combining Atmel and Microchip together. And if June quarter grows from here, June, September are stronger quarters, then we kind of just right went through soft landing and getting back to kind of seasonality and March quarter is up 9% year-over-year. And right in the upper end of that range that we had given you and over time it gets into the middle maybe or something around that. I mean, we're not minus 10%, we're not correcting like some of the people thought we will.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. Just as a follow-up on the analog business and some of your comments on that. And I think I understand what you're saying that there's growth in analog within the microcontroller market which is affecting what gets classified in the analog segment, but what does that mean going – well, I guess two questions. One is why are we seeing that now in that – are there particular product cycle transitions happening which would cause that to show up in the numbers now? And then what does that mean for the analog business going forward? Should we expect some flattening of the growth on the analog business over the next several quarters as that trend plays out?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So the transition we're going through is some of our analog business was connectivity business when it either got originally created or if it came to us from an acquisition, was largely all analog in its functionality and therefore classified as analog. As time went on, if you look at a customer's system, we then begin to see what are the other functions that are on that customer's system. And often there are microcontrollers that are there to be able to take advantage of that analog.
What we did some time back was create a new set of products which effectively combined the microcontroller and the analog into a single product. And as we go win new designs – and by the way, sometimes that microcontroller was ours, in other cases the microcontroller was somebody else's. But when you take a complete solution, which is a single chip which has the microcontroller and the analog, particularly in some of these smart connectivity solutions and there's a fair amount of software that we provide, the combined solution is a far more defensible, far higher margin and far more sticky business that we have. So it creates the right answer and we don't think ahead of time should we create products that fall into analog or fall into microcontroller. We're doing what we think we need to do to be able to grow, protect and have high profitability on the products we have. So that's one part of the headwind you're seeing, so to speak, by classifying it as microcontroller versus analog.
But the other side of the tailwind that is coming, and I think we will see it progress along is the standard analog products that we've had, as they get attached around our microcontroller, our new designs as we have talked about the total system solution and the whole Microchip 2.0 approach of going to market. The remaining analog products will, over time, get back some of that tailwind and have that growth. And there's a bit of cross-currents between some of the analog that is moving to microcontroller for the right reasons, and the new analog designs that will come in and give us growth. But in the long run, we fully expect that analog will be a part of the growth story for Microchip.

Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
By the way, if a pure analog company adds a microcontroller core to another complex product to improve performance or programmability or for any other reason, they would still call it an analog product. If exact same product existed in Maxim or Linear or Intercell or – they'll call it an analog product. But same product, if it has a microcontroller core, we put it in microcontrollers, so it's a classification difference. It doesn't change the value proposition. At the end, we have a better total solution for the customer, more sticky socket, higher ASP, higher margins and overall growing the revenue.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Sure. But just to be clear then, with that trend and the microcontroller growth on a year-on-year basis already up, as we model your analog business going forward, that trend should persist until, I guess, you said, you see that attach rate from the analog components start to rise. Is that the correct interpretation?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
It's certainly, as Ganesh described, it has some headwind because of that. Because of that classification, it puts a little tailwind on the microcontroller, a little headwind on the analog. How it will manifest itself longer-term next quarter or the quarter after and all that, we don't really yet know. It's a new phenomenon. I mean, we manage the company in an overall growth and we don't really care where you put it.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
All right. That's fair. Thank you.

We'll go next to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. First question relates to Atmel. Company did a fantastic job of improving the margin structure of Atmel and I had thought that maybe some of that margin improvement was adjusting which end markets are being targeted with the historical Atmel products, maybe more towards automotive and industrial. Can you just talk about to what extent that was a factor or is consumer still a pretty big part of the mix? And I asked just to better understand the comment around the Atmel seasonality in March versus the historical rates.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, I mean, we have had Atmel for seven quarters. That's usually the – six quarters plus is the lead time to get a new product in production. So if you talk (00:38:44) a lot of this improvement has come from because we largely changed the flavor of which markets the products were sold, I think you miscalculated there. What we had said was Atmel had a focus on – what terminology we used, home runs, Eric?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah. Swinging for the fences.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah. Swinging for the fences. We had a focus on large account in consumer segment, swinging for the fences and some you win, some you lose, and gross margins are lower and all that. So we very largely changed the focus on where the future retention is. And true, it's automotive, it's industrial, in other areas and less on the consumer accounts. But it didn't change the existing flavor of those parts in the last several quarters till those designs were obsolete and the new designs we are focused on come to fruition.
So a large majority of the margin structure change has come from improvement of pricing, disciplined pricing, dramatic cost reduction in the fab, assembly test, bringing a lot of those parts inside, reducing a large portion of the expenses, just doing the whole job overall better and rationalizing R&D, rationalizing manufacturing. But you cannot change the flavor of the business regarding what segments of business is in seven quarters. You barely touch it in seven quarters.

Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And then for a follow-up on capital allocation, the company had talked in previous quarters about potentially engaging in M&A now that the balance sheet has been improved. I'm curious for an update on how Microchip is thinking about that at this point, especially with the increased flexibility in your cash post the U.S. tax reform?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
We are really not thinking any differently. Post U.S. tax reform, the cash becomes easily movable from offshore that really was not easily movable before because it was permanently invested offshore. But our priorities have not changed. We continue to believe our priorities are investing in M&A first, dividend second, and our stock buyback only opportunistically. So those have not changed.

We'll go next to Christopher Danely with Citigroup.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey. Thanks, Steve. Just to talk about, I guess, the soft landing that we're all trying to engineer here. Can you give us a little more color on like specifically what would be the combined typical June seasonality for Microchip plus Atmel? And then could we be above or below that? I mean, I guess, how can we be sure that we've, I guess, landed yet in terms of the soft landing?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So I don't have the number for June quarter. It's a good question. We should have thought about it. I don't have it off the cuff. But you have seen strong June quarters for the last two years, you've seen strong September quarters for the last two years, and then you have seen stronger than historical December quarters. March quarter is right at seasonality. So it's really – that's what I'm seeing where it has landed. Therefore, the June quarter is below seasonal. If that's your concern, we think the June quarter should be pretty good, June quarter should be strong.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got it. And then how would you compare this slowdown or return to normal or soft landing or whatever you want to call it, versus like prior slowdowns that you've seen? Maybe talk a little bit about the linearity of bookings, how your customers feel, how the (00:42:53) feel inventory?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, I think when you look at cycles, no two cycles are really different. One, many of the prior cycles have crash landed, and this one certainly is not crash landing. We engineered a soft landing here. The other factor was in some of the prior cycles, some sort of second catalyst happened. In 2014, it was a dramatic slowdown in China that we saw at first, and four months later, everybody saw it in stocks' price significant selloff. In some prior cycles, they were driven by other factors, a tech burst in 2000 or whatever, we're going way back. I don't see any other second catalyst this time, it's just driven by getting a capacity in line, bringing the lead times down, going from a high book-to-bill ratio to a very moderating one book-to-bill ratio. I mean, at one book-to-bill ratio you can grow the business forever, just take incremental terms every quarter and the business can grow. And for 90% of our business life, the book-to-bill is around 1, right?
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah, that's right.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah. And that where it should be, that means the lead times are short, people can get their product. We still have some challenges on the Atmel side in about one-and-a-half business units like I talked about and those are built-in analyses, and that part of it we still need to soft land. But it's largely there, I think. I think it's right over the runway.

Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and Steve for giving us the numbers that really show the 10 percentage point difference between Atmel's first quarter calendar seasonality and what was Microchip to make sense of things. So what I wanted to do is shift over to margins and ask you about the target March model, because when I look at the business I see that with gross margins we're I think within a 100 basis points of target, with operating I think we're within 60 basis points. The team's done a spectacular job improving margins over time, and you've raised the targets multiple times, I believe. The question is as you get this close to targets, is there anything that you would see that test (00:45:42) the business would have a ceiling at those targets, or is there an opportunity to operate above those targets?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So I think what we do not want to do is on any parameter when we are above the target, or in the case of operating expense where we are below the target, then we suck that in and make that as a new target and keep thinking that the other one has to go higher. And then the operating margin goes over 40%, and then we say, well, how high is the target. The peak can't be the target. The business will oscillate over good times and bad times and very strong environments and weaker environments. 40% is a long-term target. Can it temporarily in good times go over 40%? The answer is yes, but there'll be equal times when a business is in recession and software will be less than 40%.
So if you're really doing the math like you did, you're saying, well gross margin is about 100 basis points away from target and operating expenses already at target, wouldn't our operating margin go higher? Well, the answer to that is yes but that's not long-term, that's temporary. It might go there. But during huge growth we have had last year, fiscal year 2017 or 2018, we grew 13.7% or a number like that. During that same time, expenses do not keep up and you get on the lower end of the expenses. And when the business moderates sometime, then the expenses catch up a little bit because otherwise, you're not able to hire people enough in a very, very strong time.
So again, you've got to give it a flex. And as managers, we don't want to be in such a tight box that every little slack, you suck it in. And then we're in such a small box, then we're just missing point one here and point two there. So think of that way. On a pure math basis, can the operating margins go higher? Yes, temporarily. We're not willing to yet admit that the longer-term margins could be higher than 40%.
And the second piece of that is still the M&A strategy. I have never bought a business that makes 40% operating margin or 39.5% where we are. So whenever we buy a business, it's usually much lower, then you have to understand the flavor of its business, can we improve its growth? Can we improve its operating expense? Where does it go? And then a blended margin comes up, and usually most acquisitions result into a blended margin to be slightly lower. For example, Microchip's operating margins are still several hundred bps above the Atmel flavor of the business, so it's 39.5% total, but Microchip is well above 40% and Atmel is much lower than 40% and we're still improving it. And some of the Atmel may never get where Microchip is and we were quite honest from the beginning and say, we'll improve it substantially. We have gone from Atmel breakeven to in the mid-30%s, but it can't match mid-40%s where Microchip might be. And I'm just putting fat brackets here and not giving you where the breakdown is. So I don't know whether that helps, but don't keep making our box smaller and smaller, please, we need some room to operate.

J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
It's also the balance of (00:49:36) and profitability. So we've got to make sure that the investments for growth are there so that it's not just profitability but without any growth.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Speaking of growth, Ganesh, I'm going to ask a question on a business I don't think I've ever called out on the quarterly call before, but you did note the very strong sequential performance of a licensing business, and underneath that you highlighted some of the recent agreements that have been made with foundry and the growth that's being driven off that. As we look at that strong sequential growth, what does that mean and what do the recent business signings mean for the performance of that business in the immediate term, and what kind of beneficial effect does that have on the company's margin structure?
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So I want to be clear that the improvement in the results are not from recent signings. Signings took place multiple years ago after which you have to go install the technology, qualify the technology, allow the technology to ramp, and then have that ramp generate royalty revenue. And royalty is the substantially larger portion of the revenue that we get from the licensing business. And that continues to layer in as by either foundry or IDM that we license it to by node that it is licensed, and it can also change based on how a given process node succeeds or doesn't succeed. So much like in our IC designs where you have to get those designs early and then work with the customer to realize the revenue, it can take 24 months, 36 months. Licensing has a similar kind of thing where what you're seeing in today's benefit are things we did one, two, three years ago. And we continue to have new licenses that we are getting signed off that will create future growth, and I think we expect licensing will contribute to the overall growth that Microchip has, and of course at a much higher level of profitability.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I would say though that on the effect of licensing on the margin, licensing is a $100 million business. So a $100 million business at a higher gross margin than Microchips overall, but Microchip is at a $4 billion dollar run rate roughly. It's just really a small needle mover. There are equal number of other various business units where certain products are much higher gross margins, certain other products are less gross margin, and the mix moves forward and sometimes one has a stronger growth, the other has strong growth. True, licensing business is accretive to the gross margin, but at $100 million or a $400 million, it doesn't dominate.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, guys.

We'll go next to Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Yeah, this is Adam Gonzales on for Vivek. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering how we should think about your CapEx moving into fiscal 2019 in the context of some of the views you've laid out on the demand environment in a relative supply-demand balance? Thanks.
J. Eric Bjornholt - Microchip Technology, Inc.
So we haven't gone through our annual operating plan process for fiscal 2019 yet so we're not ready to give a number on that as it is. We have made significant investments as last year, we have goals to bring the assembly and tests that we do internally hire and that will require investment. But I don't think we're ready to give – provide the street with a number yet for next year's CapEx. Still going to be a small percentage of overall net sales.
Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And I guess just one quick follow-up. I know this is a bit nitpicky on the seasonality issue, but in the March quarter, you guys are down 1% quarter-on-quarter, what's different this year versus last year? I mean, you had Atmel for a full quarter then and sales over 2% sequentially, so just what was better than seasonal in March versus this year?

Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
That's kind of what threw everybody off. Last quarter was very noisy. The – not the last quarter, March quarter last year was very noisy. We had just gone go live on January 1. There were a bunch of orders that were pushed out into the quarter. There were just – there were a lot of moving parts and there was a large amount of delinquency we had carried in the prior quarter of December, some of it we were able to meet. We were new to that business. It was the first March quarter we had had. Atmel had also left a fair amount of pricing and all that on the table. We talked about it and we were seeing a significant impact of price increases we had done which matched some of the seasonality. There were just way too many moving parts.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Plus the environment was stronger in March last year.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, not that environment is weak now though, but it's certainly not as strong as a year ago. So I think that's what threw everybody else off. And...
Adam J. Gonzales - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay.. Thanks very much.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I think this time there's no such noise, and this is a true seasonality with Atmel.

We'll go next to Kevin Cassidy with Stifel.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes, thanks. And congratulations on the quarter. Going to the Microchip 2.0 strategy of platforms, how is that affecting your pressure on ASPs. You had mentioned before, Steve, that industry consolidation, you're seeing less pressure, but is this helping maybe even lift ASPs?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, I mean, the answer to that is yes. I mean, I don't know if the ASPs continuously go up, but we are severely resisting the pressure to give year-over-year declines in large majority of the cases we're succeeding and are able to hold our ASPs, plus as we add a microcontroller intelligence to analog, as we attach analog around microcontroller will be more input into the customer to have a total solution. In general, you can bundle and it's more sticky and it helps ASP. All that is happening. But I mean, semiconductor ASPs do not constantly go up. I think if you can have them not go down, that will be good enough.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah. It avoids commoditization of the individual products when you can take a complete solution and have this (00:56:23) show the customer the value in doing that.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Right. And maybe and even on the OpEx side is, your platforms, are the designs robust enough that you can win designs without Microchip employees or FAEs being involved?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, across 115,000-plus customers, a vast majority of the customers we don't have Microchip FAEs involved. You just can't have that many employees covers, so there is a large amount of effort in us building reference designs, documenting, training on the web, training in person. W train 30,000 engineers around the world in various masters' conferences, seminars and webinars and onsite customer training. So there is a – Microchip is huge. Microchip is a very vast training organization teaching our customers how to do it. And then, there is a lot of self-start help and all that where customers are designing a product. Vast majority of Microchip's customers, you do not have a Microchip FAE involved in helping them in their design. There's a Microchip FAE involved in overall general training with which they do their design. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to have enough people.

We'll go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. From a geographical perspective on a year-over-year basis, you're driving growth in all of your geographies, so demand looks pretty broad based. But one of the geographies that kind of stands out is the Americas region, growth was up 5% versus the rest of the fees that were up at least double that rate. Any reason for the slower growth in the Americas region?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Well, the problem is we count the revenue where the product is shipped not where the product is designed. So manufacturing largely keeps moving out of Americas, and I don't know whether it will change in the coming years. So when you look at 5% Americas growth, it artificially understates it when internally we look at the revenue in the Americas counting back the revenue which was generated in America and shipped overseas and Americas growth was great. It was just as good as any other geography. It wasn't weak.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
But we report actually it's where we shipped it.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. It seems like the team has gained quite a bit of traction with these analog products with the integrated MCU cores for these, what do you guys call, smart connectivity solutions. Can you guys just give us some examples of where these type of connectivity solutions are used, applications or end markets? And when you say connectivity, are you talking about both wired and wireless connectivity integrated with your MCUs?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah. Go ahead.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
It's both. So let's take one example which probably you have but you're not familiar with. Your car has a USB hub in it. And depending on the vintage of your car, that is a hub that has progressed over time from at one time being largely an analog-only solution to today being a smart connectivity solution where that hub has a way to recognize what is being attached to it, has a way to either be a slave or a master. It has a way to control your display, and of course, power the devices connected to it. So it's a far smarter hub today than it was several years ago. Several years ago we would've called that an analog product. And as the new designs have gone into production, those we would call as a microcontroller product.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
You could take a different market – take a thermostat, a large number of thermostats nationwide, you can access them now through your phone or pad. I know I can access the thermostats in my house on my phone remotely while traveling, turn the temperature off or down or up. Or if I'm going to be on business for longer than was anticipated, I can keep the house turned off. Those are all connectivity solutions where you're doing it wirelessly. And it would have a micro Wi-Fi or a micro and a Bluetooth, for example, on the same chip, rather than two chips.
The large number of speakers in the home, you don't connect them anymore. You simply Bluetooth it from your phone into the speaker and the sound is coming. You don't really access the music through a box or something anymore these days. I mean, you can still do that, most times you access the music through the phone and just Bluetooth into any of the speakers in your home. That's connectivity wirelessly.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
You can take those same general examples and apply it to Ethernet to CAN, to various forms of wireless and so on and so forth.

Good evening. When you look at your business, you still see revenues growing at 7% to 9% over the next few years. And...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yes. As we are driving our business, we are modeling our business and looking at the impact of 2.0, those are the targets we are driving towards.
Gil Alexandre - Darphil Associates
And as you look at the business now, how strong do you find the Asian business and the European business?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Last year, all three businesses were very strong. If you look at just on a quarterly basis, March quarter has the Chinese New Year, so Asian business in the current quarter is always weak. European business in the March quarter, they're the strongest geography in the March quarter, and America is normal. If you look at the December quarter, usually with all the holidays and all that, Europe and America businesses were weak, and Asia business was okay. So each quarter, it's kind of slightly different. When you go to June quarter, Asia business rebounds strongly from Chinese New Year quarter of March to June. I don't know if that helps.

We'll go next to Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Due to no response from Rajvindra (01:03:41), we'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Steve, congratulations on the solid results, especially on the operating margin. Steve, one of the questions I had, over the last several months as you talked about sort of the soft landing scenario, you kind of alluded to the potential that you could keep every quarter this calendar year in that sort of high-single digit long-term revenue growth target. Is that still kind of the way you see this calendar year playing out? And I guess secondly, if it is, do you get there on just seasonal growth sequentially or will it take some above seasonal quarters?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
John, I don't know, I think this March quarter Atmel seasonality last year kind of threw everybody off, I would say including us. And as we really dove into it and looked at our backlog and look at the business and then analyzed prior five years of Atmel business and the behavior of these large swinging for the fences accounts and design wins, the last year's performance kind of threw it off and those accounts still had a problem last year. But it was kind of overcome by the general halo of price increases and a lot of under-marketing of AVRs and all that that Atmel had done and where we improved the position, stronger distribution, and things like that.
So the number of things last year kind of threw it off, and I guess all of us together somehow didn't quite capture the blended March seasonality. So that's what we are adjusting to. So give us a little time to get our feet back on the earth and really see what effect it has on the rest of the quarter. I mean, economy is not bad, bookings are not bad, the business is not bad. We're getting strong turns, our inventory is right. We're not in a massive inventory correction mode of any kind. There's really no problem in business. We're doing well. And when you do the calculation like we have shared, we are right on target. But obviously...
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful. And, Steve...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.

Go ahead.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Well, just anecdotally, for me one of the things that's always important as we kind of orchestrate the soft landing as book-to-bill and lead times come in, are you seeing any sort of unusually high cancelation patterns or different order patterns from your customers, or are they responding to your ability to meet demands in an orderly fashion?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Yeah. So they're just responding to us shipping into a more orderly fashion. If you recall, last March to last June, the bookings were not any stronger, the book-to-bill was exactly the same because we informed the customers of lead time, they responded with higher orders out in time to respond to their lead time. And as the lead times have come in, then customers that are adjusting to their lower lead time and don't have to place outer bookings which is then lowering the book-to-bill ratio, and now it's at parity and it's moderating so customers are essentially giving us as many bookings as they need and don't have to give huge bookings out in time. This is almost perfect landing, I think, so far. The only difference, I think, street had higher expectations for March looking at March seasonality last year which was kind of typical Microchip, and basically there were lots of other factors in the business, pricing and others which match that seasonality. And this year, December to March, we can't.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, Steve.
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
And obviously, result is some of the other quarters have to be stronger and I think they will be and hopefully they will be. Certainly, last year they were/ March, June, September, December, they were all stronger, and this year should be the same. Next couple of quarters should be stronger because of that March seasonality.

We'll go next to Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.
Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.
Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey, Steve, can you give us a rundown on the competitive dynamic in 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit? Have things changed over the past several years and so on? Thanks.
Ganesh Moorthy - Microchip Technology, Inc.
The number of competitors continues to be reasonably – a reasonable number of good strong competitors. We have continued to move up that ranking and so we have been gaining share in all of these product lines, including the overall microcontrollers as well. Some of these competitors have had various challenges relative to either their capacity. In some cases they're being acquired or not, so there have been those kind of things that are taking place there. But microcontrollers remains a competitive product line, a competitive market and I think that more rational actors today than they were perhaps five years ago. And they are responding, in some cases more so, or in some cases less so to the consolidation that's taking place, and that certainly helps as well. So nothing dramatic to report that is different about our competitive dynamics in microcontrollers.
Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.
And Ganesh as a...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I mean our Microcontrollers – I'm sorry...
Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.
I just want to say...
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
Microcontrollers business is up, I think almost, 19% last year. It was higher than Microchip's growth and higher than the industry growth in that segment. Based on FIA numbers, we gained share in all three 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, and I shared with you the overall share gain by 90 bps almost. So I think things are good.

Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.
Okay. Would it be safe to say that the average microcontroller actor out there is not using price as a way to gain share, it's more a value proposition?
Steve Sanghi - Microchip Technology, Inc.
I don't really know if just gaining share by price has ever worked in microcontroller. These are complex parts, and over time we have shown surveys when you ask a customer what do you consider for choosing a microcontroller, the most frequent answer is the ecosystem, the tools, the support, qualities, the reliability, the customer, the samples, development tools and everything else. Price is one other factor. So these are not commodity products, it takes two years for the customer to go to production after they have made the device selection.
So price has never been really the way to gain share, but there were players in the market that were irresponsive. They will drop the price too quickly and not stand up and fight to really maintain their price. And some of those have disappeared or some of those have become better and more responsible. But overall, I don't think price has been a mechanism to gain share in the market ever.
Hans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.
