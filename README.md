# MSIM Capstone Project : Team Do It With DATA - D A Davidson
# SmartInvest : Sentiment Driven Insights using NLP

Our project automates the process of reading through and analyzing the lengthy corporate SEC Ô¨Ålings and quarterly earnings call transcripts which are used by the portfolio managers to evaluate their credibility and predict growth and performance. The work done by Team Do-It-With-Data aimed to understand the unstructured data and convert it into a structured form so it could be usable for further analysis. Our work also focused on summarizing the key features important for this evaluation, followed by the implementation of the various techniques required to deal with the unstructured data, applying Natural Language Processing techniques to the structured data and generating sentiment and credibility indexes which helped the portfolio advisors to evaluate company performance as well as observe industry and sector trends. The end product delivered is a fully functioning Tableau Dashboard summarizing the sentiment evaluation of several companies that is easy to use by the portfolio managers and analysts at D.A.Davidson and provides a quick, high-level and comparative overview. 

Our project is divided into 5 phases which includes: 
1. Data Acquisition 
2. Data Pre-Processing 
3. Data Structuring and Storage 
4. Metrics Calculation 
5. Dashboard Development 

These phases were carried out separately for Call Transcripts and the SEC Filings data.
