"MEDALLION FINANCIAL CORP","10-K","2018","1","ITEM 1. OUR BUSINESS We, Medallion Financial Corp. or the Company, are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company organized as a Delaware corporation. We have elected to be treated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act, although as described below, expect to withdraw from this status on or about April 1, 2018. We are a specialty finance company that has historically had a leading position in originating, acquiring, and servicing loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial businesses. Recently, our strategic growth has been through a wholly-owned portfolio company of ours, Medallion Bank, which originates consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats, and trailers and to finance small-scale home improvements. Since Medallion Bank acquired a consumer loan portfolio and began originating consumer loans in 2004, it has increased its consumer loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Since 1996, the year in which we became a public company, we have increased our taxicab medallion loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 2%, and our commercial loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 4% (5% and 4% on a managed basis when combined with Medallion Bank). In January 2017, we announced our plans to transform our overall strategy. We are transitioning away from medallion lending and placing our strategic focus on our growing consumer finance portfolio. Total assets under our management and the management of our unconsolidated wholly-owned subsidiaries, which includes our managed net investment portfolio, as well as assets serviced for third party investors, were $1,593,000,000 as of December 31, 2017, and $1,632,000,000 as of December 31, 2016, and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 10% from $215,000,000 at the end of 1996. Since our initial public offering in 1996, we have paid distributions in excess of $263,060,000 or $14.66 per share. We conduct our business through various wholly-owned investment company subsidiaries including: <U+0095>   Medallion Funding LLC, or Medallion Funding, a Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC, our primary taxicab medallion lending company; <U+0095>   Medallion Capital, Inc., or Medallion Capital, an SBIC and a regulated investment company, or RIC, which conducts a mezzanine financing business; and <U+0095>   Freshstart Venture Capital Corp., or Freshstart, an SBIC and a RIC, which originates and services taxicab medallion and commercial loans. We formed a wholly-owned portfolio company, Medallion Servicing Corporation, or MSC, to provide loan services to Medallion Bank, also a portfolio company wholly-owned by us. We have assigned all of our loan servicing rights for Medallion Bank, which consists of servicing taxi medallion loans originated by Medallion Bank, to MSC, which bills and collects the related service fee income from Medallion Bank, and is allocated and charged by us for MSC's share of these servicing costs. In addition, we conduct business through a wholly-owned portfolio company, Medallion Bank, a bank regulated by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions which originates consumer loans, raises deposits, and conducts other banking activities. Medallion Bank generally provides us with our lowest cost of funds which it raises through bank certificates of deposit. To take advantage of this low cost of funds, historically we have referred a portion of our taxicab medallion loans to Medallion Bank, which then originated these loans and are serviced by MSC. As a non-investment company, Medallion Bank is not currently consolidated with the Company, which is an investment company under the 1940 Act. We would be permitted to consolidate Medallion Bank with the Company to the extent we withdraw our election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act as discussed in further detail below. Our diversified investments in other controlled subsidiaries are comprised of Medallion Fine Art, Inc., Medallion Motorsports, LLC, and LAX Group, LLC. In addition, we made both marketable and nonmarketable equity investments. We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company, organized as a Delaware corporation, under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. On March 7, 2018, a majority of the Company's shareholders authorized the Company's Board of Directors to withdraw the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and our Board of Directors approved the filing of the Company's withdrawal form with the SEC to be made on or about April 1, 2018. At that point, we would no longer be a BDC or be subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs. During our tax years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and therefore we became subject to taxation as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Code. We had in previous years qualified and elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC. As a RIC, we generally did not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we distributed to our shareholders as dividends, if we met certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. Medallion Bank is not a RIC and must pay corporate-level US federal and state income taxes. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, the Company would remain ineligible to file as a RIC under the Code and would be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes. See Note 5 for more information. 3 Table of Contents We are managed by our executive officers under the supervision of our Board of Directors. As a result, we do not pay investment advisory fees, but instead we incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. Alvin Murstein, our chairman and chief executive officer, has over 60 years of experience in the ownership, management, and financing of taxicab medallions and other commercial businesses. Andrew M. Murstein, our president, has over 30 years of experience and is the third generation in his family to participate in the business.

Our Market We provide loans to individuals and small to mid-size businesses, both directly through our investment company subsidiaries and also through Medallion Bank, in three primary markets: <U+0095>   loans that finance taxicab medallions; <U+0095>   loans that finance commercial businesses; and <U+0095>   loans that finance consumer purchases of recreational vehicles, boats, motorcycles, and trailers, and to finance small scale home improvements. 4 Table of Contents The following chart shows the components of our $1,380,054,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017.

Medallion Loans Taxi medallion loans of $208,279,000 comprised 34% of our $610,135,000 net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to $266,816,000 or 41% of our $652,278,000 net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016. Managed taxi medallion loans of $388,001,000 comprised 28% of our $1,380,054,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to $528,643,000 or 35% of our $1,517,592,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016. Including loans to unaffiliated investors, the total amount of medallion loans under our management was $414,350,000 as of December 31, 2017, compared to $553,439,000 as of December 31, 2016. Since 1979, we and Medallion Bank have originated, on a combined basis, approximately $3,630,000,000 in medallion loans in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Newark, Cambridge, and other cities within the United States. In addition, our management has a long history of owning, managing, and financing taxicab fleets, taxicab medallions, and corporate car services, dating back to 1956. Medallion loans collateralized by New York City taxicab medallions and related assets comprised 73% and 69% of the value of the medallion loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and were 81% and 76% on a managed basis. Based on taxi medallion values published by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, or TLC, and our cash flow analysis, we estimate that the total value of all of New York City taxicab medallions and related assets such as the vehicle, taximeter, and roof lights exceeded $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2017. We estimate that the total value of all taxicab medallions and related assets in our major US markets exceeded $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. While medallion loans do become delinquent or in default, all of our medallion loans are secured by the medallion and enhanced with personal guarantees of the shareholders and owners. When a borrower defaults on a loan, we have the ability to restructure the underlying loan or repossess the medallion collateralizing that loan and sell it in the market or through a foreclosure auction and pursue the personal guarantees. Given the current market conditions we have taken significant realized and unrealized losses against non-performing loans to mitigate potential future losses. The following table displays information on managed medallion loans outstanding (other than those managed for third party investors) in each of our major markets at December 31, 2017.

(2) Based on the contractual rates of the portfolios at December 31, 2017. 5 Table of Contents The New York City Market. A New York City taxicab medallion is the only permitted license to operate a taxicab and accept street hails in New York City, except as discussed below. As reported by the TLC, individual (owner-driver) medallions and corporate medallions sold for a wide variety of prices during the year. Our analysis of transaction activity combined with cash flow analysis of owners and operators supported our estimated value of $315,000, net of liquidation costs, as of December 31, 2017. The number of taxicab medallions is limited by law to 13,630 medallions outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The New York State legislature enacted a law on December 21, 2011 which was amended on February 17, 2012 to permit cars for hire to pick up street hails in the boroughs outside Manhattan. Pursuant to the law, the TLC began issuing Street Hail Livery licenses in June 2013. A prospective medallion owner must qualify under the medallion ownership standards set and enforced by the TLC. These standards prohibit individuals with criminal records from owning medallions, require that the funds used to purchase medallions be derived from legitimate sources, and mandate that taxicab vehicles and meters meet TLC specifications. In addition, before the TLC will approve a medallion transfer, the TLC requires a letter from the seller's insurer stating that there are no outstanding claims for personal injuries in excess of insurance coverage. After the transfer is approved, the owner's taxicab is subject to quarterly TLC inspections. Most New York City medallion transfers are handled through approximately 20 medallion brokers licensed by the TLC. In addition to brokering medallions, these brokers also arrange for TLC documentation insurance, vehicles, meters, and financing. We have excellent relations with many of the most active brokers, and regularly receive referrals from them. Brokers generated 5% of the loans originated during 2017, and 26% for 2016. However, we receive most of our referrals from a small number of brokers. The Chicago Market. We estimate that Chicago medallions sold for approximately $47,000, net, as of December 31, 2017. Pursuant to a municipal ordinance, the number of outstanding medallions is capped at 6,995 as of December 31, 2017. We estimate that the total value of all Chicago medallions and related assets is over $373,908,000 as of December 31, 2017. The Boston Market. We estimate that Boston medallions sold for approximately $274,400, net, as of December 31, 2017. The number of Boston medallions is capped at 1,825 as of December 31, 2017. We estimate that the total value of all Boston medallions and related assets is over $522,242,000 as of December 31, 2017. The Newark Market. We estimate that Newark medallions sold for approximately $196,000, net, as of December 31, 2017. The number of Newark medallions has been limited to 600 since 1950 by local law. We estimate that the total value of all Newark medallions and related assets is over $121,800,000 as of December 31, 2017. The Cambridge Market. We estimate that Cambridge medallions sold for approximately $49,000, net, as of December 31, 2017. The number of Cambridge medallions is 257 as of December 31, 2017. We estimate that the total value of all Cambridge medallions and related assets is over $14,225,000 as of December 31, 2017. Commercial Loans Commercial loans finance either the purchase of the equipment and related assets necessary to open a new business or the purchase or improvement of an existing business. From the inception of the commercial loan business in 1987 through December 31, 2017, we and Medallion Bank have originated more than $955,837,000 of commercial loans. Commercial loans of $90,188,000 comprised 15% of our $610,135,000 net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to $83,634,000 or 13% of our $652,278,000 net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016. Managed commercial loans of $91,783,000 comprised 7% of our $1,380,054,000 net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to $86,200,000 or 6% of our $1,517,592,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016. We have worked to increase our commercial loan activity in recent years, primarily because of the attractive higher yielding nature of most of this business. The outstanding balances of managed commercial loans have grown at a compound annual rate of 4% since 1996. The increase since 1996 has been primarily driven by internal growth through the origination of additional commercial loans. We focus our marketing efforts on the manufacturing, professional, scientific, and technical services and other services. The majority of our commercial borrowers are located in the New York metropolitan area and the Midwest. We plan to continue expanding our commercial loan activities by developing a more diverse borrower base, a wider geographic area of coverage, and by expanding targeted industries. Commercial loans are generally secured by equipment, accounts receivable, real estate, or other assets, and have interest rates averaging 735 basis points over the prevailing prime rate at year end, down from 901 basis points over prime at the end of 2016. As with medallion loans, the vast majority of the principals of borrowers personally guarantee commercial loans. The aggregate realized loss of principal on managed commercial loans has averaged less than 2.0% per annum for the last five years. 6 Table of Contents The following table displays information on managed commercial loans outstanding (other than those managed for third party investors) in each of our major markets at December 31, 2017.

(2) Based on the contractual rates of the portfolios at December 31, 2017. Secured Mezzanine Loans. Through our subsidiary Medallion Capital, we originate both senior and subordinated loans nationwide to businesses in a variety of industries, including manufacturing and various service providers, more than 53% of which are located in the Midwest and Northeast regions, with the rest scattered across the country. These mezzanine loans are primarily secured by a second position on all assets of the businesses and generally range in amount from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 at origination, and represent approximately 96% of our managed commercial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017, and were 87% as of December 31, 2016. Frequently, we also receive warrants to purchase an equity interest in the borrowers of secured mezzanine loans. Other Secured Commercial Loans. We originate other commercial loans to a variety of businesses nationwide, including retail trade and various service providers. These commercial loans are generally secured by all of the assets of the businesses and are generally personally guaranteed by the principals. Frequently, we receive assignments of lease from our borrowers. The loans generally range in size from under $100,000 to approximately $1,000,000. These loans represented approximately 4% of the managed commercial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 and were 13% of as December 31, 2016. Historically, most of the portfolio has consisted of fixed-rate loans. Consumer Loans. Consumer loans are originated by Medallion Bank, a wholly-owned, unconsolidated portfolio company. Consumer loans of $683,502,000 comprised 49% of our $1,380,054,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to $700,685,000 or 46% of our $1,517,592,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016, and represent our largest lending segment. The loans are collateralized by recreational vehicles, boats, trailers, and home improvements, located in all 50 states. The portfolio is serviced by a large third party servicer. We believe that Medallion Bank's consumer loan portfolio is of acceptable credit quality given the high interest rates earned on the loans, which compensate for the higher degree of credit risk in the portfolio. Other. We also provide debt, mezzanine, and equity investment capital to companies in a variety of industries. These investments may be venture capital style investments which may not be fully collateralized. This is a small, but growing portion of our business. Our Strategy Our core philosophy has been ""In niches there are riches."" We try to identify markets that are profitable and where we can be an industry leader. Key elements of our strategy include: Capitalize on our relationships with brokers and dealers. We are committed to establishing, building, and maintaining our relationships with our brokers and dealers. Our marketing efforts are focused on building relationships with dealers in the consumer market and contractors and suppliers in the home improvement sector. We believe that our relationships with dealers and brokers provide us with, in addition to potential investment opportunities, other significant benefits, including an additional layer of due diligence and additional monitoring capabilities. We have assembled a management team that has developed an extensive network of dealer and broker relationships in our target markets over the last 50 years. We believe that our management team's relationships with these dealers and brokers have and will continue to provide us with significant investment opportunities. In 2017, 100% of our consumer loans were generated by brokers and dealers, and there were few originations in the medallion or commercial lending space. 7 Table of Contents Employ disciplined underwriting policies and maintain rigorous portfolio monitoring. We have an extensive investment underwriting and monitoring process. We conduct a thorough analysis of each potential investment and its prospects, competitive position, financial performance, and industry dynamics. We stress the importance of credit and risk analysis in our underwriting process. We believe that our continued adherence to this disciplined process will permit us to continue to generate a stable, diversified and increasing revenue stream of current income from our debt investments to enable us to make distributions to our shareholders. Leverage the skills of our experienced management team. Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alvin Murstein, and our President, Mr. Andrew M. Murstein. Alvin Murstein has over 60 years of experience in the ownership, management, and financing of taxicab medallions and other commercial businesses, and Andrew M. Murstein is the third generation in his family to participate in the business and has over 30 years of experience in the ownership, management, and financing of taxicab medallions and other commercial businesses. The other members of our management team have broad investment backgrounds, with prior experience at specialty finance companies, middle market commercial banks, and other financial services companies. We believe that the experience and contacts of our management team will continue to allow us to effectively implement the key aspects of our business strategy. Perform Strategic Acquisitions. In addition to increasing market share in existing lending markets and identifying new niches, we seek to acquire medallion financing businesses and related portfolios and specialty finance companies that make secured loans to small businesses which have experienced historically low loan losses similar to our own. Since our initial public offering in May 1996, eight specialty finance companies, five loan portfolios, and three taxicab rooftop advertising companies have been acquired.

(2) Excludes net realized losses of $7,736, $5,875 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 related to investments other than securities and other assets. (3) Excludes net unrealized depreciation of $2,076, $28,372, and $10,839 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 related to investments other than securities and other assets. Investment Characteristics Medallion Loans. Our medallion loan portfolio consists of mostly fixed-rate loans, collateralized by first security interests in taxicab medallions and related assets (vehicles, meters, and the like). We estimate that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of all of the medallion loans was 131% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 129% as of December 31, 2016, reflecting the conservative values we have placed on all medallion loans, including the vast majority which are performing as agreed. These ratios also do not factor in the managed unrealized depreciation on these loans of $62,723,000 and $63,252,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. In addition, we have recourse against a vast majority of the owners of the taxicab medallions and related assets through personal guarantees. Medallion loans generally require equal monthly payments covering accrued interest and amortization of principal over a five to twenty-five year schedule, subject to a balloon payment of all outstanding principal at maturity. Historically, we have originated loans with one-to-five year maturities where interest rates are adjusted and a new maturity period set. In most cases, borrowers may prepay medallion loans upon payment of a fee of approximately 1% to 2%. 8 Table of Contents Historically, we generally retain the medallion loans we originate; however, from time to time, we participate or sell shares of some loans or portfolios to interested third party financial institutions. In these cases, we retain the borrower relationships and service the sold loans. Mezzanine and Commercial Loans. We have typically originated mezzanine and commercial loans in principal amounts generally ranging from under $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, and occasionally, have originated loans in excess of that amount. These loans are generally retained and typically have maturities ranging from three to ten years and require monthly payments ranging from full amortization over the loan term to fully deferred interest and principal at maturity, with multiple payment options in between. Substantially all loans may be prepaid, and in the first five years, a fee will be owed to us. The term of, and interest rate charged on, certain of our outstanding loans are subject to the regulations of the Small Business Administration, or the SBA. Under SBA regulations, the maximum rate of interest permitted on loans originated by us is 19%, however, terms and interest rates are subject to market competition for all loans. Unlike medallion loans, for which competition and market conditions precludes us from charging the maximum rate of interest permitted under SBA regulations, we are able to charge the maximum rate on certain commercial loans. Consumer Loans. Consumer loans generally require equal monthly payments covering accrued interest and amortization of principal over a negotiated term, generally around ten years. Interest rates offered are fixed. Borrowers may prepay consumer loans without any prepayment penalty. In general, Medallion Bank has established relationships with dealers and contractors in the industry, who are the sources for most of the customers of Medallion Bank. Marketing, Origination, and Loan Approval Process We employ 38 personnel to originate, manage, service and collect on the medallion, commercial, and consumer loans. Each loan application is individually reviewed through analysis of a number of factors, including loan-to-value ratios, a review of the borrower's credit history, public records, personal interviews, trade references, personal inspection of the premises, and approval from the TLC, SBA, or other regulatory body, if applicable. Each medallion and commercial loan applicant is required to provide personal or corporate tax returns, premises leases, and/or property deeds. Senior management establishes loan origination criteria. Loans that conform to such criteria may be processed by a loan officer with the proper credit authority, and non-conforming loans must be approved by the chief executive officer and/or the chief credit officer. Both medallion and commercial loans are sourced from brokers with extensive networks of applicants, and commercial loans are also referred by contacts with banks, attorneys, and accounting firms. Consumer loans are primarily sourced through relationships which have been established with recreational vehicle and boat dealers, and home improvement contractors throughout our market area. Sources of Funds We have historically funded our lending operations primarily through credit facilities with bank syndicates and, to a lesser degree, through equity or debt offerings or private placements, and fixed-rate, senior secured notes and long-term subordinated debentures issued to or guaranteed by the SBA. Since the inception of Medallion Bank, substantially all of Medallion Bank's funding has been provided by FDIC insured brokered certificates of deposit. The determination of funding sources is established by our management, based upon an analysis of the respective financial and other costs and burdens associated with funding sources. Our funding strategy and interest rate risk management strategy is to have the proper structuring of debt to minimize both rate and maturity risk, while maximizing returns with the lowest cost of funding over an intermediate period of time. 9 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our sources of available funds and amounts outstanding under credit facilities and their respective end of period weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2017. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about each credit facility.

The mismatch between maturities and interest-rate sensitivities of these balance sheet items results in interest rate risk. We seek to manage our exposure to increases in market rates of interest to an acceptable level by: <U+0095>   Originating adjustable rate loans; <U+0095>   Incurring fixed-rate debt; and <U+0095>   Purchasing interest rate caps to hedge a portion of variable-rate debt against increases in interest rates. Nevertheless, we accept varying degrees of interest rate risk depending on market conditions. For additional discussion of our funding sources and asset liability management strategy, see Asset/Liability Management on page 53. 10 Table of Contents Competition Banks, credit unions, and finance companies, some of which are SBICs, compete with us in originating medallion, commercial, and consumer loans. Many of these competitors have greater resources than we do and certain competitors are subject to less restrictive regulations than us. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and complete the financing transactions that will permit us to compete successfully. Employees As of December 31, 2017 we employed 138 persons, including 69 at our Medallion Bank subsidiary. We believe that relations with all of our employees are good. MATERIAL US FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS Taxation as a Corporation For our tax years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not qualify for RIC status and as a result our status changed from a RIC subject to Subchapter M of the Code to a corporation subject to taxation under Subchapter C of the Code. As a result of such change for the taxable periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have been taxed as a corporation and must pay corporate-level federal and state income taxes on our taxable income. Through December 31, 2015, we qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a result of our status as a RIC in prior years, we generally were not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and capital gains we distributed to our shareholders, but we were also not permitted to carry forward net operating losses from year to year. Because we were taxed as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Code for the tax year ended December 31, 2016, we are able to carry forward any net operating losses historically incurred to succeeding years, which we would not be permitted to do if we were subject to taxation as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. However, because we did not qualify for RIC status for the tax years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, distributions will generally be taxable to our shareholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal tax purposes. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of a shareholder's tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Qualification as a RIC is made on an annual basis and, although we and some of our subsidiaries have qualified in the past, we cannot assure you that we will qualify for such treatment in the future. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, the Company would remain ineligible to file as a RIC under the Code and would be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government signed into law the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,"" which makes significant changes to the U.S. income tax rules applicable to both individuals and entities, including corporations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes provisions that, among other things, reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, introduce a capital investment deduction, limit the interest deduction, limit the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income and make extensive changes to the U.S. international tax system. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is complex and far-reaching, and we cannot predict the impact its enactment will have on us, our subsidiaries, our portfolio companies and our shareholders. Taxation as a RIC If and to the extent that the Company remains a BDC under the 1940 Act and we satisfy the requirements to be treated as a RIC in a future taxable year, the following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations that would be applicable to us and to an investment in shares of our common stock in such tax year. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such an investment in a year in which we satisfy the requirements to be treated as a RIC. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including shareholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, and financial institutions. This summary assumes that investors will hold our common stock in such a taxable year as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this annual report and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, regarding an investment in our common stock for a year in which we satisfy the requirements to be treated as a RIC. This summary does not discuss any aspects of the Medicare Contribution tax, U.S. estate or gift tax, or foreign, state, or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under US federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets. 11 Table of Contents As used herein, a ""US person"" is a person that is for US federal income tax purposes: <U+0095>   a citizen or individual resident of the United States; <U+0095>   a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the US or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; or <U+0095>   a trust or an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source. A ""US shareholder"" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is a US person. A ""non-US shareholder"" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is not a US shareholder and is not a partnership for US federal income tax purposes. If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective shareholder that is a partner of a partnership holding shares of our common stock should consult its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of shares of our common stock. Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares will depend on the facts of his, her, or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of federal, state, local, and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws. In the event we meet the requirements to be treated as a RIC in a taxable year, in such tax year we generally would not have to pay corporate-level US federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders as dividends for such taxable year. To qualify as a RIC in a taxable year, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to obtain RIC tax treatment in a taxable year we would be required to distribute to our shareholders, for each such taxable year, at least 90% of our ""investment company taxable income,"" which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses. We refer to this distribution requirement as the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we, in a taxable year: <U+0095>   qualify as a RIC; and <U+0095>   satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement; then we would not be subject to US federal income tax for such tax year on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses) we distribute to shareholders. We will be subject to US federal income tax at the regular corporate rates in such tax year on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders. As a RIC we would be subject to a 4% nondeductible US federal excise tax on certain undistributed income of RICs unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year, and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in preceding years. We refer to this distribution requirement as the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In order to qualify as a RIC for US federal income tax purposes in a tax year, we must, among other things: <U+0095>   qualify to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each such taxable year; <U+0095>   derive in each such taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in ""qualified publicly traded partnerships"" (i.e., partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends, capital gains, and other traditionally permitted mutual fund income described in this paragraph) or the 90% Income Test; and <U+0095>   diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of each such taxable year: <U+0095>   at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, US Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and <U+0095>   no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than US Government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships. We refer to these two requirements as the Diversification Tests. 12 Table of Contents In such taxable year in which we meet the RIC qualification requirements, we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income in such taxable year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in such taxable year in which we are treated as a RIC in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we would not have received any corresponding cash amount. In the taxable years we met the requirements to be treated as a RIC, we were authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we were not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities were outstanding unless certain ""asset coverage"" tests were met. See ""Regulation - Senior Securities."" In any tax year that we qualify as a RIC, our ability to dispose of assets to meet the distribution requirements in such year may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we were to dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement in such tax year, we may have to make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. GOVERNMENT REGULATION Regulation by the SBA Medallion Funding, Medallion Capital, and Freshstart are each licensed by the SBA to operate as SBICs, under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, or the SBIA. The SBIA authorizes the organization of SBICs as vehicles for providing equity capital, long term financing, and management assistance to small business concerns. Under the regulations promulgated by the SBA a ""small business concern"" is defined as a business that is independently owned and operated, which does not dominate its field of operation, and which (i) has a tangible net worth, together with any affiliates, of $19.5 million or less and average annual net income after US federal income taxes for the preceding two fiscal years of $6.5 million or less (average annual net income is computed without the benefit of any carryover loss), or (ii) satisfies alternative criteria under the Federal government's North American Classification System, or the NAICS, that assigns codes to the industry in which a small business is engaged and provides a small business size standard based either on the number of persons employed by the business or its gross revenues. In addition, at the end of each fiscal year, at least 25% of the total amount of loans made (after April 25, 1994) must be made in ""smaller businesses"" that have a net worth of $6.0 million or less, and average net income after federal income taxes for the preceding two years of $2.0 million or less. A business that meets the NAICS size standards also qualifies as a ""smaller business"" for purposes of meeting SBA's size standard regulations. Investments by SBICs must be in active, primarily domestic businesses. SBIC regulations preclude investment in the following types of businesses: (1) financial companies whose principal business activity is as a relender or reinvestor (that is, directly or indirectly, providing funds to others, purchasing debt obligations, factoring, or long term leasing of equipment with no provision for maintenance or repair); (2) many kinds of real estate projects; (3) single purpose projects that are not continuing businesses; (4) companies located outside the U. S. intending to use the proceeds of the investment outside of the U.S. or companies that are located in the U.S. that have more than 50% of their employees located outside of the U.S.; (5) businesses that are passive and do not carry on an active trade or business; (6) businesses that use 50% or more of the funds to buy goods or services from an associated supplier; and (7) certain ""sin businesses"" such as gambling and the like. Nonetheless, the regulations provide an exception to (1) above for an SBIC that provides Venture Capital Financing investments (represented by common or preferred stock, a limited partnership interest or a similar partnership interest) to a Disadvantaged Business that is a relender or reinvestor), so long as, without SBA prior approval, total outstanding financings do not exceed the SBICs regulatory capital at the end of its fiscal year. Under current SBA regulations, the maximum rate of interest that Medallion Funding, Medallion Capital and Freshstart may charge may not exceed the higher of (i) 19% or (ii) the sum of (a) the higher of (i) that company's weighted average cost of qualified borrowings, as determined under SBA regulations, or (ii) the current SBA debenture rate, plus (b) 11%, rounded to the next lower eighth of one percent. As of December 31, 2017, the maximum rate of interest permitted on loans originated by Medallion Funding, Medallion Capital, and Freshstart was 19%. As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding medallion loans had a weighted average rate of interest 4.41% and our outstanding commercial loans had a weighted average rate of interest of 12.02%. Current SBA regulations also require that each loan originated by an SBIC has a term between one and 20 years. In addition, SBICs are subject to periodic examination by the SBA, for which the SBA charges examination fees. SBICs are required to maintain certain minimum levels of capital and must maintain certain records and make them available for SBA examination. SBICs also are required to prepare valuations of their portfolio investments in accordance with prescribed valuation 13 Table of Contents guidelines, to maintain certain minimum levels of capital, to file annual reports containing financial, management and other information and to file notices of certain material changes in their ownership and operations. We are examined by the SBA annually for compliance with applicable SBA regulations. SBICs are precluded from making investments in a small business if it would give rise to a conflict of interest. Generally, a conflict of interest may arise if an associate of the SBIC has or makes an investment in the small business the SBIC is financing or serves as one of its officers or would otherwise benefit from the financing. A conflict of interest would also occur if an SBIC were to lend money to any of its officers, directors, and employees, or invest in any affiliates thereof. Joint investing with an associate (such as another fund controlled by affiliates of the General Partner) may be made on identical terms or on terms that are fair to the SBIC. The SBA also prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a ""change of control"" or transfers which would result in any person (or group of persons acting in concert) owning 10% or more of any class of capital stock of an SBIC. A ""change of control"" is any event which would result in the transfer of the power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of an SBIC, whether through ownership, contractual arrangements, or otherwise. Under SBA regulations, without prior SBA approval, loans by licensees with outstanding SBA leverage to any single small business concern may not exceed 30% of an SBIC's regulatory capital, as defined in the SBIA. SBICs must invest idle funds that are not being used to make loans in investments permitted under SBA regulations. These permitted investments include direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the government of the US with a term of 15 months or less and deposits maturing in one year or less issued by an institution insured by the FDIC. These permitted investments must be maintained in (i) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the US, which mature within 15 months from the date of the investment; (ii) repurchase agreements with federally insured institutions with a maturity of seven days or less if the securities underlying the repurchase agreements are direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the US, and such securities must be maintained in a custodial account in a federally insured institution; (iii) mutual funds, securities, or other instruments that exclusively consist of, or represent pooled assets of, investments described in (i) or (ii) above; (iv) certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less, issued by a federally insured institution; (v) a deposit account in a federally insured institution, subject to withdrawal restriction of one year or less; (vi) a checking account in a federally insured institution; or (vii) a reasonable petty cash fund. SBICs may purchase voting securities of small business concerns in accordance with SBA regulations. Although prior regulations prohibited an SBIC from controlling a small business concern except in limited circumstances, regulations adopted by the SBA on October 22, 2002 (pursuant to Public Law 106-554) allow an SBIC to exercise control over a small business for a period of seven years from the date on which the SBIC initially acquires its control position. This control period may be extended for an additional period of time with the SBA's prior written approval. If an SBIC defaults in its payment obligations to SBA under its outstanding debentures, fails to comply with any terms of its securities, or violates any law or regulation applicable to it, the SBA has the right to accelerate the maturity of all amounts due under its debentures. Additionally, the SBA can bring suit for the appointment of a receiver for the SBIC and for its liquidation in the event a default on payment of a SBIC's debentures or for serious regulatory violations. Regulation of Medallion Bank as an Industrial Bank In May 2002, we formed Medallion Bank, which received approval from the FDIC for federal deposit insurance in October 2003. Medallion Bank, a Utah-chartered industrial bank, is a depository institution subject to regulatory oversight and examination for safety and soundness by both the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Medallion Bank is examined annually by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Numerous other federal and state laws and regulations govern almost all aspects of Medallion Bank's operations and, to some degree, our operations and those of our non-bank subsidiaries as institution-affiliated parties. Under its banking charter, Medallion Bank is empowered to make consumer and commercial loans, and may accept all FDIC-insured deposits other than demand deposits (checking accounts). Medallion Bank provides stable and low-cost bank deposit funding for our key lending business activities conducted through Medallion Bank. In addition, the FDIC has regulatory authority to prohibit Medallion Bank from engaging in any unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. Medallion Bank is subject to risk-based and leverage capital standards issued by the federal banking regulators. These standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets, and to achieve greater consistency in evaluating the capital adequacy of major banks throughout the world. Under the risk-based capital standards, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with designated weights, and the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. 14 Table of Contents In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted the U.S. Basel III capital rules, which implement many aspects of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's Basel III capital framework and are aimed at increasing both the quantity and quality of regulatory capital. The requirements in the U.S. Basel III capital rules began to phase in on January 1, 2015, for many covered banking organizations, including Medallion Bank. Most requirements in the U.S. Basel III capital rules will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019. Because Medallion Bank was already subject to a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC that required it to hold capital in excess of the then applicable capital requirements, we do not believe that the U.S. Basel III capital rules will have a material impact on Medallion Bank's business. Under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, Medallion Bank is subject to the following minimum capital ratios: <U+0095>   a new Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; <U+0095>   a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%; <U+0095>   a Total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and <U+0095>   a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. In addition, Medallion Bank is subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will increase by 0.625% each subsequent January 1 until January 1, 2019. Including the buffer, by January 1, 2019, Medallion Bank will be required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios: a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 8.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of greater than 10.5%. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of qualifying minority interests that are in the form of common stock. The U.S. Basel III capital rules retain or modify certain deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital and also provide for new ones. In addition, the U.S. Basel III capital rules provide for limited recognition in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 capital above certain thresholds, of three categories of assets: (i) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks (net of related valuation allowances and of deferred tax liabilities), (ii) mortgage servicing assets (net of associated deferred tax liabilities) and (iii) investments in more than 10% of the issued and outstanding common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions (net of associated deferred tax liabilities). For purposes of calculating the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios, the assets of covered banking organizations are given risk weights that, under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, range from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the nature of the asset. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. government have a 0% risk weight, while general obligation claims on states or other political subdivisions of the United States are assigned a 20% risk weight, except for municipal or state revenue bonds, which have a 50% risk weight. Most first-lien residential mortgage exposures that are prudently underwritten and performing according to their original terms carry a 50% risk weight, with a 100% risk weight for other residential mortgage exposures. In addition, certain off-balance sheet items are assigned credit conversion factors to convert them to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk weight is applied. For example, the unused portion of unconditionally cancellable commitments is assigned a 0% conversion factor, while self-liquidating, transaction-related contingent items with an original maturity of one year or less and the amount of a commitment with an initial maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable by the covered banking organization are converted at 20%. Transaction-related contingencies such as bid bonds and standby letters of credit backing nonfinancial obligations, as well as the amount of a commitment with an original maturity of more than one year that is not unconditionally cancellable, have a 50% conversion factor. General guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations are given a 100% conversion factor. In addition, pursuant to provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, and related regulations with respect to prompt corrective action, FDIC-insured institutions such as Medallion Bank may only accept brokered deposits without FDIC permission if they meet specified capital standards, and are subject to restrictions with respect to the interest they may pay on deposits unless they are well capitalized. The U.S. Basel III capital rules revised the capital threshold to be well capitalized. Effective January 1, 2015, in order to qualify as well capitalized, an insured depository institution must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and the bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level. 15 Table of Contents Pursuant to a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC, we and Medallion Bank have agreed that the capital levels of Medallion Bank will at all times meet or exceed the levels required for Medallion Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the FDIC rules and regulations, that Medallion Bank's Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio will be maintained at not less than 15%, and that Medallion Bank will maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses. Medallion Bank is also subject to certain federal laws that restrict and control its ability to extend credit and provide or receive services between affiliates. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder limit the transfer of funds by a depository institution to certain of its affiliates, including us, in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or purchases of assets. Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W also require generally that the depository institution's transactions with its affiliates be on terms no less favorable to Medallion Bank than comparable transactions with unrelated third parties. The USA Patriot Act and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, or the Patriot Act, was enacted on October 26, 2001, and is intended to detect and prosecute terrorism and international money laundering. The Patriot Act establishes new standards for verifying customer identification incidental to the opening of new accounts. Medallion Bank has undertaken appropriate measures to comply with the Patriot Act and associated regulations. Other provisions of the Patriot Act provide for special information sharing procedures governing communications with the government and other financial institutions with respect to suspected terrorists and money laundering activity, and enhancements to suspicious activity reporting, including electronic filing of suspicious activity reports over a secure filing network. The compliance programs required by the Patriot Act are intended to supplement pre-existing compliance requirements that apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, regulations to which Medallion Bank is also subject. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions, including banks, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Bank Secrecy Act includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. Medallion Bank has in place policies, procedures and internal controls in order to comply with Bank Secrecy Act and OFAC laws and regulations. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. Federal and state banking agencies require Medallion Bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures. Medallion Bank must undergo regular on-site examinations by the appropriate banking agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution. The results of the examination are confidential. The cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate. Regulation by the SEC and under the 1940 Act We are a closed-end, management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (BDC) under the 1940 Act. We conduct our business through various wholly-owned investment company subsidiaries including Medallion Funding LLC, a closed end investment company, Medallion Capital, Inc., a BDC, and Freshstart Venture Capital Corp., a BDC. Pursuant to various exemptive orders, we operate and are regulated as a single BDC. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters, and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than ""interested persons,"" as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities voting as a class. On March 7, 2018, a majority of the Company's shareholders authorized the Company's Board of Directors to withdraw the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and our Board of Directors approved the filing of the Company's withdrawal form with the SEC to be made on or about April 1, 2018. At that point, we would no longer be a BDC or be subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs. For a discussion of the shareholder protections of the 1940 Act that would no longer apply if the Company ceases to operate as a BDC, see ""Risk Factors  -  Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure  -  Our shareholders would no longer have the protections of the 1940 Act upon the withdrawal of the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC."" The remainder of the discussion in this subsection currently applies to our operations as a BDC and would continue to apply in the future only if the Company remains a BDC under the 1940 Act. We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an ""underwriter"" as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities 16 Table of Contents or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. Certain of these limits are not applicable to our investments in our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiaries. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of our policies are fundamental, and each may be changed without stockholder approval. Qualifying Assets Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company's total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: (1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is generally defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: (a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, any state in the US; (b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and (c) satisfies any of the following: <U+0095>   does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, or has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; <U+0095>   is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, and the BDC in fact exercises a controlling influence on the management or policies of such eligible portfolio company and, as a result of such control, has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or <U+0095>   is a company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million. (2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. (3) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from a US issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. (4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own at least 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. (5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. (6) Cash, cash equivalents, US Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. (7) Subject to certain conditions, securities issued by a company that met the definition of eligible portfolio company at the time of our initial investment but subsequently does not meet the definition because the company no longer meets the definition set forth above. Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the US and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2), or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than certain companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations, or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 17 Table of Contents Temporary Investments Pending investment in other types of ""qualifying assets,"" as described above, our investments may consist of cash equivalents, US government securities, or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in US Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the US government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. Senior Securities We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes without regard to full asset coverage requirements. In addition to the 1940 Act, we are subject to two exemptive orders which govern how we calculate our senior securities and under which we have agreed that we will meet the applicable asset coverage ratios both individually and on a consolidated basis. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see ""Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Operations as a BDC - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we raise additional capital."" Other considerations under the 1940 Act We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. We are periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our shareholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person's office. We have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and intend to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have designated a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering our policies and procedures. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, we anticipate modifying these policies and procedures to reflect our status as a non-BDC. Other Because Medallion Bank is an ""insured depository institution"" within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act and we are a ""financial institution holding company"" within the meaning of the Utah Financial Institutions Act, federal and Utah law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us and, indirectly, Medallion Bank, without, in most cases, prior written approval of the FDIC or the Commissioner of Utah Department of Financial Institutions, as applicable. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires 25% or more of any class of our voting stock. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires 10% or more of any class of voting stock and is subject to a number of specified ""control factors"" as set forth in the applicable regulations. Although Medallion Bank is an ""insured depository institution"" within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, your investment in Medallion Financial Corp. is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC, or any other agency, and is subject to loss. Under the Utah Financial Institutions Act, control is defined as the power to vote 20% or more of any class of our voting securities by an individual or to vote more than 10% of any class of our voting securities by a person other than an individual. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our common stock in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. 18 Table of Contents In addition to the regulations detailed above, our operations are subject to supervision and regulation by other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Additionally, our operations may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions. This oversight may serve to: <U+0095>   regulate credit granting activities, including establishing licensing requirements, if any, in various jurisdictions; <U+0095>   establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; <U+0095>   require disclosures to customers; <U+0095>   govern secured transactions; <U+0095>   set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices; <U+0095>   prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and administration of loans; and <U+0095>   regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower's credit experience and other data collection. Changes to laws of states in which we do business could affect the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot accurately predict whether such changes will occur or, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and NASDAQ Corporate Governance Regulations The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. In addition, NASDAQ has adopted corporate governance listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.

RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure Changes in the taxicab and for-hire vehicle industries have resulted in increased competition and have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations. There have been recent changes in the taxicab and for-hire vehicle industries that have resulted in increased competition in all of our taxi medallion markets. Ridesharing applications, or ridesharing apps, utilized by for-hire vehicles were introduced in New York City in 2011 and continue to expand domestically and globally. Many of these for-hire vehicle operators operate outside of the regulatory regime with which we and our borrowers operate, which poses an increased risk of competition because such operators are able to pass the cost savings of not having to comply with certain regulations to its passengers. According to the TLC, between January 2017 and January 2018 approximately 16,000 new for-hire vehicle licenses were issued, increasing the total number of for-hire vehicles to approximately 105,100 as of January 31, 2018, an 18% increase from January 2017. In addition, the New York State legislature enacted a law on December 21, 2011, which was amended on February 17, 2012, to permit cars for-hire to pickup street hails in boroughs outside of Manhattan. Pursuant to this law the TLC has issued approximately 8,300 Street Hail Livery licenses since June 2013, of which approximately 3,800 are active. 19 Table of Contents TLC annualized data through December 2017 has shown a 13.9% reduction in total New York City taxicab fares, compared to the same period in 2016, and a 13.5% reduction in the total number of New York City taxicab trips. Such reductions in fare totals and taxicab trips are likely the result of a combination of ridesharing apps, Street Hail Livery licenses, and other forms of public transportation. As of December 31, 2017, 15.9% of our managed medallion loan portfolio and 26.1% of our on-balance sheet loan portfolios were 90 days or more past due, compared to 18.8% and 24.4% at December 31, 2016. As discussed in further detail below, there have also been recent decreases in the values of our medallion loan collateral and our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure. Increased competition from ridesharing apps and Street Hail Livery licenses has reduced our market share, the overall market for taxicab services, the supply of taxicab drivers, income from operating medallions, and the value of taxicab medallions. If these trends continue and intensify, there would be a further material increase to our loan to value ratios, loan delinquencies, and loan defaults resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Decreases in the value of our medallion loan collateral and our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure have had a material adverse effect on our business. A significant portion of our loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by New York City taxicab medallions. According to TLC data, over the past 20 years New York City taxicab medallions had appreciated in value from under $200,000 to $1,320,000 for corporate medallions and $1,050,000 for individual medallions in 2014. As reported by the TLC, individual (owner-driver) medallions and corporate medallions sold for a wide range of prices during 2017. Like many other financial institutions, we evaluate the transactions and cash flows underlying borrower performance and determined that a market value of $324,000, $315,000 net of liquidation costs, was appropriate, reflecting a blend of transactional activity and values supported by borrower cash flows. In March 2017, the New York City Council made changes to the medallion classes, eliminating the distinction between individual and corporate medallions. Until the market fully stabilizes we will not be able to determine the ultimate impact of this change, however, we believe it will allow for greater economic investment as these rules were a significant barrier of entry into the industry. We own 159 Chicago taxicab medallions that were purchased out of foreclosure in 2003. Additionally, a portion of our loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by Chicago taxicab medallions. The Chicago medallions had appreciated in value from $50,000 in 2003 to approximately $370,000 in 2013. Since that time, however, there has been a decline in the value of Chicago taxicab medallions to approximately $48,000, $47,000 net of liquidation costs, at the end of 2017. Decreases in the value of our medallion loan collateral has resulted in an increase in the loan-to-value ratios of our medallion loans. We estimate that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of our managed medallion loans was approximately 131% as of December 31, 2017 and 129% as of December 31, 2016. If taxicab medallion values continue to decline, there could be an increase in medallion loan delinquencies, foreclosures, and borrower bankruptcies. Our ability to recover on defaulted medallion loans by foreclosing on and selling the medallion collateral would be diminished, which would result in material losses on defaulted medallion loans which would have a material adverse effect on our business. A substantial decrease in the value of our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure would adversely affect our ability to dispose of such medallions at times when it may be advantageous for us to do so. If we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our medallions quickly, we would realize less than the value at which we had previously recorded such medallions. We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested, and may increase the risk of investing in us. Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested, and therefore increase the risk associated with investing in us. We borrow from and issue senior debt securities to banks and other lenders, and through long-term subordinated SBA debentures. These creditors have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our shareholders. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could reduce the amount available for distribution payments. As of December 31, 2017, we had $327,623,000 of outstanding indebtedness, which had a weighted average borrowing cost of 4.01% at December 31, 2017, and our wholly-owned unconsolidated portfolio companies, primarily Medallion Bank, had $906,748,000 of outstanding indebtedness at a weighted average borrowing cost of 1.51%. Most of our borrowing relationships have maturity dates during 2018. We have been in active and ongoing discussions with each of these lenders and have extended each of the facilities as they matured except as set forth in the following risk factor. Certain lenders have worked with us to extend and change the terms of the borrowing agreements. See Note 4 for a discussion of the current and new lending arrangements to date. 20 Table of Contents Failure to obtain an extension of our existing credit facilities or failure to obtain additional revolving credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We utilize secured revolving credit facilities and other facilities to fund our investments. We cannot guarantee that our credit facilities will continue to be available beyond their current maturity dates on reasonable terms or at all or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. Our revolving credit facilities have converted to term loans. Obtaining additional revolving credit facilities or other alternative sources of financing may be difficult and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms favorable to us or at all. The availability of revolving credit facilities depends, in part, on factors outside of our control, including regulatory capital treatment for unfunded bank lines of credit, the financial strength and strategic objectives of the banks that participate in our credit facilities and the availability of bank liquidity in general. If the credit facilities are not renewed or extended by our lenders by their maturity dates, we will not be able to make further borrowings under the facilities after they mature and the outstanding principal balances under such facilities will be due and payable at maturity. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, our financial condition would be adversely affected and our lenders may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness. If we are unable to extend or replace these facilities or arrange new credit facilities or other types of interim financing, we may need to curtail or suspend loan origination and funding activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We and our subsidiaries obtain financing under lending facilities extended by various banks and other financial institutions, some of which are secured by loans, taxi medallions and other assets. Where these facilities are extended to our subsidiaries, we and others of our subsidiaries may guarantee the obligations of the relevant borrower. Five of our smallest subsidiaries are borrowers under promissory notes extended to them by a bank that total $8.8 million that came due on October 17, 2016. These loans are secured by Chicago taxi medallions owned by our subsidiaries. These notes are guaranteed by Medallion Funding, not by Medallion Financial Corp. These subsidiaries have not repaid the amounts due under the notes and the bank has filed a suit seeking payment of these amounts. This failure to pay would constitute an event of default under certain loan agreements which we or our subsidiaries are borrowers, but the lenders under those agreements have waived the default. If judgment is entered against us in the suit brought by the bank or entered and not satisfied within specified periods of time, these outcomes may constitute an additional event of default under these other agreements. If waivers are required and not granted for this additional event of default, it would lead to events of default under other of our financing arrangements. We are subject to certain financial covenants and other restrictions under our loan and credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. Our loan and credit agreements contain financial covenants and other restrictions relating to borrowing base eligibility, tangible net worth, net income, leverage ratios, shareholders' equity, and collateral values. Our ability to meet these financial covenants and restrictions could be affected by events beyond our control, such as a substantial decline in collateral values or a rise in borrower delinquencies. A breach of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that is subject to an applicable cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. Certain other events can constitute an event of default. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or holders of the related notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Based on the foregoing factors, the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our current credit agreements and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The issuance of debt securities or preferred stock and our borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions may affect holders of our common stock. Our business may periodically require capital. We may issue debt securities or preferred stock, and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as senior securities. Any amounts that we use to service our debt or make payments on preferred stock will not be available for distributions to our common shareholders. It is likely that any senior securities we issue will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, some of these securities or other indebtedness may be rated by rating agencies, and in obtaining a rating for such securities and other indebtedness, we may be required to abide by operating and investment guidelines that further restrict operating and financial flexibility. We and, indirectly, our shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities and other indebtedness. Preferred stock or any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences, and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock, including separate voting rights, and could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control to the detriment of the holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our shareholders at that time would decrease and they may experience dilution. Moreover, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to issue and sell additional equity securities in the future, on favorable terms or at all. 21 Table of Contents Consumer lending by Medallion Bank carries a higher risk of loss and could be adversely affected by an economic downturn. By its nature, lending to consumers carries with it a higher risk of loss than commercial lending. Although the net interest margins should be higher to compensate Medallion Bank for this increased risk, an economic downturn could result in higher loss rates and lower returns than expected, and could affect the profitability of Medallion Bank's consumer loan portfolio. We are dependent upon our key investment personnel for our future success. We depend on the diligence, skill, and network of business contacts of the investment professionals we employ for sourcing, evaluating, negotiating, structuring, and monitoring our investments. Our future success will also depend, to a significant extent, on the continued service and coordination of our senior management team, particularly, Alvin Murstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew M. Murstein, our President, and Larry D. Hall, our Chief Financial Officer. The departure of Messrs. Murstein or Mr. Hall, or any member of our senior management team, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. Changes in taxicab industry regulations that result in the issuance of additional medallions or increases in the expenses involved in operating a medallion would lead to a decrease in the value of our medallion loan collateral and our Chicago medallions purchased out of foreclosure. Every city in which we originate medallion loans, and most other major cities in the United States, limits the supply of taxicab medallions. This regulation results in supply restrictions that support the value of medallions. Actions that loosen these restrictions and result in the issuance of additional medallions into a market could decrease the value of medallions in that market. If this were to occur, the value of the collateral securing our then outstanding medallion loans in that market would be adversely affected. We are unable to forecast with any degree of certainty whether any other potential increases in the supply of medallions will occur. In New York City, Chicago, Boston, and other markets where we originate medallion loans, taxicab fares are generally set by government agencies. Expenses associated with operating taxicabs are largely unregulated. As a result, the ability of taxicab operators to recoup increases in expenses is limited in the short term. Escalating expenses, such as rising gas prices and an increase in interest rates, can render taxicab operations less profitable, could cause borrowers to default on loans from us and would adversely affect the value of our collateral. We operate in a highly regulated environment, and if we are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state, or local laws or regulations applicable to us, our business could suffer. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed federal financial services regulation and affects, among other things, the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. In addition to the statutory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, the legislation also delegated authority to US banking, securities and derivatives regulators to impose additional restrictions through required rulemaking. The Dodd-Frank Act requires a company that owns an industrial bank to serve as a ""source of strength"" to the institution. We believe that we have historically served, and will serve in the future, as a source of strength to our industrial bank subsidiary, Medallion Bank. We do not believe that the codification of this requirement under the Dodd-Frank Act materially impacts our obligations. A company that owns an industrial bank is also subject to the Dodd-Frank Act ""Volcker Rule."" We do not believe that the ""Volcker Rule"" materially impacts our operations as presently conducted. For so long as we remain a BDC, the 1940 Act imposes numerous constraints on our operations. For a discussion of those constraints, see ""Government Regulation - Regulation by the SEC and under the 1940 Act."" Any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act, if applicable, could have material adverse consequences to us or our investors, including possible enforcement action by the SEC. See ""Risk Factors - Risks Associated with Our Operations as a BDC."" Other changes in the laws or regulations applicable to us more generally, may negatively impact the profitability of our business activities, require us to change certain of our business practices, materially affect our business model, limit the activities in which we may engage, affect retention of key personnel, require us to raise additional regulatory capital, increase the amount of liquid assets that we hold, otherwise affect our funding profile or expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). Any such changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition. We are also subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as local licensing requirements, and retail financing, debt collection, consumer protection, environmental, health and safety, creditor, wage-hour, anti-discrimination, whistleblower and other employment practices laws and regulations and we expect these costs to increase going forward. The violation of these or future requirements or laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal sanctions against us, which may include fines, a cease and desist order against the subject operations or even revocation or suspension of our license to operate the subject business. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs to comply with these requirements and laws and regulations. 22 Table of Contents Changes in laws, regulations, or policies may adversely affect our business. The post-financial crisis era has been marked by an increase in regulation, regulatory intensity, and enforcement. We are unable to predict all of the ways in which this change in the regulatory environment could impact our business models or objectives. The laws and regulations governing our lending, servicing, and debt collection activities or the regulatory or enforcement environment at the federal level or in any of the states in which we operate may change at any time which may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect, however, to see an increase over time in regulatory scrutiny and enforcement in the area of consumer financial products regulation, as a result of the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, by the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB is responsible for interpreting and enforcing a broad range of consumer protection laws that govern the provision of deposit accounts and the making of loans, including the regulation of mortgage lending and servicing and automobile finance. While Medallion Bank's size currently falls below the threshold that would give the CFPB direct authority over it, Medallion Bank's existing bank supervisors may pursue similar policies and make similar information requests to those of the CFPB with respect to consumer financial products and other matters within the scope of the CFPB's authority. We believe that the CFPB's regulatory reforms, together with other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and increased regulatory supervision, may increase our cost of doing business, impose new restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or add significant operational constraints that might impair our profitability. We are unable to predict how these or any other future legislative proposals or programs will be administered or implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently or that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Federal and state law may discourage certain acquisitions of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders. Because Medallion Bank is an ""insured depository institution"" within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act and we are a ""financial institution holding company"" within the meaning of the Utah Financial Institutions Act, federal and Utah law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us and, indirectly Medallion Bank, without, in most cases, prior written approval of the FDIC or the Commissioner of the Utah Department of Financial Institutions, as applicable. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires 25% or more of any class of our voting stock. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires 10% or more of any class of voting stock and is subject to a number of specified ""control factors"" as set forth in the applicable regulations. Under the Utah Financial Institutions Act, control is defined as the power to vote 20% or more of any class of our voting securities by an individual or to vote more than 10% of any class of our voting securities by a person other than an individual. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our common stock in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. These provisions could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Although Medallion Bank is an ""insured depository institution"" within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, your investment in Medallion Financial Corp. is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC, or any other agency, and is subject to loss. Change in the Company's Tax Classification. RIC qualification rules require that at the end of each quarter of our taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of our assets must be represented by cash, securities of other RICs, US government securities, and other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of our assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of our assets may be invested in the securities (other than US government securities or securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, any two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by us and that are determined to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships. We monitor our compliance with these asset tests and any other 23 Table of Contents investment concentrations in conjunction with the diversification tests. As of December 31, 2017 our largest investment subject to this test was our investment in Medallion Bank, representing 52.9% of our RIC assets, and no other investments were more than 5% of our RIC assets. As a result of our failure of the 25% asset diversification test, we were not eligible to file our tax returns as a RIC for 2017. Because we did not meet the qualifications for RIC tax treatment for the tax years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and now we are subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Qualification as a RIC is made on an annual basis and, although we and some of our subsidiaries have qualified in the past, we cannot assure you that we will qualify for such treatment in the future. If we do not qualify as a RIC for more than two consecutive years, and then seek to requalify and elect RIC status, we would be required to recognize gain to the extent of any unrealized appreciation on our assets unless we make a special election to pay corporate-level tax on any such unrealized appreciation recognized during the succeeding 10-year period. To obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code in any future taxable year, we must meet the following annual distribution, income source, and asset diversification requirements. <U+0095>   The annual distribution requirement for a RIC will be satisfied if we distribute to our shareholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, and at least 90% of our net tax-exempt income. Because we use debt financing, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the distribution requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we could fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax. <U+0095>   The income source requirement will be satisfied if we obtain at least 90% of our income for each year from dividends, interest, gains from the sale of stock or securities, or similar sources. <U+0095>   The asset diversification requirement will be satisfied if we meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year. Failure to meet those requirements may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Because most of our investments will be in private companies, and therefore will be relatively illiquid, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses. If we meet the requirements to be treated as a RIC in a future tax year, for US federal income tax purposes, we would have to include in taxable income certain amounts that we would not have yet received in cash, such as original issue discount, which may arise if we received warrants in connection with the origination of a loan or possibly in other circumstances, or contractual payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. Such original issue discount or increases in loan balances as a result of payment-in-kind interest will be included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash. Since, in certain cases, we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the annual distribution requirement necessary to achieve and maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital, or reduce new investment originations for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may subsequently fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, the Company would remain ineligible to file as a RIC under the Code and would be treated as a C corporation for tax purposes. See Note 5 for more information. Our SBIC subsidiaries may be unable to meet the investment company requirements, which could result in the imposition of an entity-level tax. Some of our subsidiaries are subject to the SBIA. Our SBIC subsidiaries that are RICs may be prohibited by the SBIA from making the distributions necessary to qualify as a RIC. The SBA has agreed that our SBIC subsidiaries can make these distributions provided we reinvest the distributions in our SBIC subsidiaries as undistributed net realized earnings. We cannot assure you that this will continue to be the SBA's policy or that our subsidiaries will have adequate capital to make the required adjustments. If our subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the SBA regulations may result in loss of RIC status and a consequent imposition of an entity-level tax at the subsidiary level. In the event we are granted a waiver, we will be required to reinvest the distribution into the SBIC as capital. This may result in us recognizing taxable income without receiving a corresponding amount of cash to pay the distribution. Any failure to pay the distribution could cause a loss of RIC status and the imposition of entity level tax. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, the SBIC subsidiaries would be ineligible to file as a RIC under the Code. 24 Table of Contents Our SBIC subsidiaries are licensed by the SBA, and are therefore subject to SBA regulations. Our SBIC subsidiaries are licensed to operate as SBICs and are regulated by the SBA. The SBA also places certain limitations on the financing terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies and prohibits SBICs from providing funds for certain purposes or to businesses in a few prohibited industries. Compliance with SBA requirements may cause the SBIC subsidiaries to forego attractive investment opportunities that are not permitted under SBA regulations. Further, SBA regulations require that a licensed SBIC be periodically examined and audited by the SBA to determine its compliance with the relevant SBA regulations. The SBA prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a ""change of control"" of an SBIC or transfers that would result in any person (or a group of persons acting in concert) owning 10% or more of a class of capital stock of an SBIC. If the SBIC subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable SBIC regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibit their use of debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit them from making new investments. In addition, the SBA could revoke or suspend an SBIC license or bring a suit for the appointment of a receiver for the SBIC and for its liquidation for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of the SBIA or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder. Such actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively affect us. We anticipate withdrawing the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC and may in the future materially change our corporate structure and the nature of our business. On March 7, 2018, a majority of the Company's shareholders authorized the Company's Board of Directors to withdraw the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and our Board of Directors approved the filing of the Company's withdrawal form with the SEC to be made on or about April 1, 2018. At that point, we would no longer be a BDC or be subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs. The withdrawal of the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC would result in a significant change in our accounting and financial reporting requirements. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC, as expected, commencing with the second quarter of 2018, the Company would no longer be subject to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services  -  Investment Companies, which would result in a significant change in our accounting and financial reporting requirements. Our financial statements are currently presented and accounted for under the specialized method of accounting applicable to investment companies, which requires us to recognize our investments, including controlled investments, at fair value. As a BDC, we are currently precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company that acts as an extension of our investment operations and facilitates the execution of our investment strategy or an investment in a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services to us. Our financial statements currently consolidate the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned investment company subsidiaries, except for Medallion Bank and other portfolio investments. Our financial statements reflect our investment in Medallion Bank and other portfolio investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Medallion Bank's financial statements are separately provided as a significant unconsolidated wholly-owned subsidiary. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC, the Company will consolidate the financial statements of Medallion Bank and controlled or majority-owned portfolio investments together with those of the Company, which would be a significant change in our accounting and financial reporting requirements. Our shareholders would no longer have the protections of the 1940 Act upon the withdrawal of the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC. If the Company ceases to operate as a BDC, our shareholders would no longer have the following protections of the 1940 Act: <U+0095>   we would no longer be subject to the requirement under the 1940 Act that we maintain a ratio of assets to senior securities of at least 200%; <U+0095>   we would no longer be subject to provisions of the 1940 Act prohibiting us from protecting any director or officer against any liability to the Company or our shareholders arising from willful malfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of that person's office; <U+0095>   we would no longer be required to provide and maintain an investment company blanket bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement; 25 Table of Contents <U+0095>   while the majority of our directors would still be required to be ""independent"" under applicable NASDAQ regulations, we would no longer be required to ensure that a majority of our directors are persons who are not ""interested persons,"" as defined in the 1940 Act, and certain persons who would be prevented from serving on our Board of Directors if we were a BDC would be able to serve on our Board of Directors; <U+0095>   we would no longer be subject to provisions of the 1940 Act regulating transactions between BDCs and certain affiliates; <U+0095>   we would no longer be subject to provisions of the 1940 Act restricting our ability to issue shares below net asset value or in exchange for services or to issue warrants and options; <U+0095>   we would no longer be required to disclose the Company's net asset value per share in our financial statements; <U+0095>   we would no longer be subject to provisions of the 1940 Act restricting our ability to change the nature of our business or fundamental investment policies without having to obtain the approval of our shareholders; <U+0095>   we would no longer be subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act limiting our ability to grant stock based compensation to officers, directors and employees or to provide a profit sharing program for them; and <U+0095>   we would no longer be subject to the other protective provisions set out in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the 1940 Act. In addition, we are very much affected by the legal, regulatory, tax and accounting regimes under which we operate. We periodically evaluate whether those regimes and our existing corporate structure are the optimum means for the operation and capitalization of our business. As a result of these evaluations, we may decide to proceed with structural and organizational changes (certain of which may require the approval of our shareholders), which could result in material dispositions of various assets, changes in our corporate form or other fundamental changes. We may incur certain costs in completing these evaluations and may receive no benefit from these expenditures, particularly if we do not proceed with any changes. If we withdraw our election to be regulated as a BDC, maintaining an exception from registration under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities, and the failure to maintain that exception would have material adverse consequences on our business. A company that meets the definition of an ""investment company"" under the 1940 Act, in the absence of an exception or exemption, must either register with the SEC as an investment company or elect BDC status. Historically, the composition of the Company's assets caused us to meet the definition of an ""investment company,"" and the Company made a corresponding election to be treated as a BDC. If the Company were to de-elect BDC status, as expected, we would either have to operate so as to fall outside the definition of an ""investment company"" or within an applicable exception. To the extent the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC, the Company expects to fall within the exception from the definition of an ""investment company"" provided under Section 3(c)(6) of the 1940 Act as a company primarily engaged, directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries, in the business of, among other things, (i) banking, (ii) purchasing and otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance and services, and (iii) making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance, and services. The Company would be required to monitor our continued compliance with this exception, which would limit our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities that would cause us to be out of compliance with its limitations and could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, we could be limited in growing Medallion Capital, Inc., which is currently engaged in a business that generally does not qualify for the exception. If the SEC or a court were to find that we were required, but failed, to register as an investment company in violation of the 1940 Act, we may have to cease business activities, we would breach representations and warranties and/or be in default as to certain of our contracts and obligations, civil or criminal actions could be brought against us, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court were to require enforcement and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. We compete for investments with other business development companies and other investment funds as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and credit unions. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, 26 Table of Contents establish more relationships, and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than us. We may be unwilling to match our competitors' pricing, terms, and structure of certain loans and investments opportunities due to potential risks, which may result in us earning less income than our competitors. If we are forced to match our competitors' pricing, terms, and structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on our investments or may bear substantial risk of capital loss. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us for so long as we remain a BDC. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time. Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income. Because we borrow to fund our investments, a portion of our income is dependent upon the difference between the interest rate at which we borrow funds and the interest rate at which we invest these funds. A portion of our investments, such as taxi medallion loans, will have fixed interest rates, while a portion of our borrowings will likely have floating interest rates. As a result, a significant change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds could increase, which would reduce our net investment income. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments, subject to applicable legal requirements. These activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, we will have to rely on our counterparties to perform their obligations under such hedges. A decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments, which could adversely affect our business. Our borrowers generally have the right to prepay their loans upon payment of a fee ranging from 1% to 2% for standard commodity loans, and for higher amounts, as negotiated, for larger more custom loan arrangements. A borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower's loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates. In a lower interest rate environment, we will have difficulty re-lending prepaid funds at comparable rates, which may reduce the net interest income that we receive. When this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future investment in new portfolio companies. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid, and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if a substantial number of our portfolio companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us and we are not able to reinvest the proceeds for comparable yields in a timely fashion. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock. An increase in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our business. The majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of fixed-rate loans. An abrupt increase in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at higher prevailing interest rates. We depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to make distribution payments to our shareholders. We are primarily a holding company, and we derive most of our operating income and cash flow from our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely heavily upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make distribution payments to our shareholders. Funds are provided to us by our subsidiaries through dividends and payments on intercompany indebtedness, but we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be in a position to continue to make these dividend or debt payments. The Utah Department of Financial Institutions and FDIC have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by Medallion Bank. In addition, as a condition to receipt of FDIC insurance, Medallion Bank entered into a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC requiring it to maintain a 15% leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets). As of December 31, 2017 Medallion Bank's leverage ratio was 14.5% and Medallion Bank may be restricted from declaring and paying dividends as a result of the leverage ratio being below 15%. Medallion Bank's use of brokered deposit sources for its deposit-gathering activities may not be available when needed. Medallion Bank relies on the established brokered deposit market to originate deposits to fund its operations. Medallion Bank's brokered deposits consist of deposits raised through the brokered deposit market rather than through retail branches. While Medallion Bank has developed contractual relationships with a diversified group of investment brokers, and the brokered deposit market is well developed and utilized by many banking institutions, conditions could change that might affect the availability of deposits. Applicable 27 Table of Contents statutes and regulations restrict the use of brokered deposits and the interest rates paid on such deposits for institutions that are less than ""well capitalized"". If the capital levels at Medallion Bank fall below the ""well-capitalized"" level as defined by the FDIC or the capital level currently required by the FDIC pursuant to its capital maintenance agreement, or if Medallion Bank experiences a period of sustained operating losses, the cost of attracting deposits from the brokered deposit market could increase significantly, and the ability of Medallion Bank to raise deposits from this source could be impaired. Brokered deposits may also not be as stable as other types of deposits. Medallion Bank's ability to manage its growth to stay within the ""well-capitalized"" level, and the capital level currently required by the FDIC pursuant to its capital maintenance agreement, which is also considerably higher than the level required to be classified as ""well-capitalized"", is critical to Medallion Bank's retaining open access to this funding source. Uncertainty relating to the reporting of collateral values for our loans may adversely affect the value of our portfolio. Medallion loans are primarily collateral-based lending, whereby the collateral value exceeds the amount of the loan, providing sufficient excess collateral to protect us against losses. Despite our reliance on collateral values, medallions are income producing assets that generate cash flow which is utilized to repay our loans. We rely on the integrity of the collateral value benchmarks obtained by the applicable regulatory agencies and other third parties. If these benchmarks are artificially influenced by market participants we could suffer losses. We have experienced a significant downward movement in medallion collateral values which may continue, and has caused a negative impact on our valuation analysis and could result in further significant lower fair market value measurements of our portfolio. We require an objective benchmark in determining the fair value of our portfolio. If the benchmarks that we currently use are deemed to be unreliable, we will need to use other intrinsic factors in determining the collateral values for our loans. The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. We generally make investments in private companies. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded our investments. We may also face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we have material non-public information regarding such portfolio company. In addition, the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In addition, if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we borrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains. We use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with short-term floating-rate debt, and to a lesser extent by term fixed-rate debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, and including the impact on Medallion Bank, a hypothetical immediate 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to the line item ""net increase in net assets resulting from operations"" as of December 31, 2017 by approximately $1,778,000 on an annualized basis, compared to a positive impact of $1,100,000 at December 31, 2016, and the impact of such an immediate increase of 1% over a one year period would have been approximately ($984,000) at December 31, 2017, compared to ($792,000) at December 31, 2016. Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet, and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates. We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results. We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including our ability to make investments in companies that meet our investment criteria, the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets, and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. 28 Table of Contents Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers, and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. Terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, and natural disasters may affect any market for our securities, impact the businesses in which we invest, and harm our operations and profitability. Terrorist attacks and natural disasters may harm our results of operations and your investment. We cannot assure you that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the US or US businesses or major natural disasters hitting the United States. Such attacks or natural disasters in the US or elsewhere may impact the businesses in which we directly or indirectly invest by undermining economic conditions in the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our business is focused in the New York City metropolitan area, which suffered a terrorist attack in 2001. Another terrorist attack in New York City or elsewhere could severely impact our results of operations. Losses resulting from terrorist attacks are generally uninsurable. Our financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to manage growth effectively. Our ability to achieve our investment objective will depend on our ability to grow, which will depend, in turn, on our management team's ability to identify, evaluate, and monitor, and our ability to finance and invest in, companies that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis will be largely a function of our management team's handling of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive, and efficient services, and our access to financing on acceptable terms. In addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments, members of our management team and our investment professionals may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. In order to grow, we will need to hire, train, supervise, and manage new employees. However, we cannot assure you that any such employees will contribute to the success of our business. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted. The SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to lend money to any of their officers, directors, and employees, or invest in any affiliates thereof. Medallion Bank is subject to certain federal laws that restrict and control its ability to engage in transactions with its affiliates. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and applicable regulations restrict the transfer of funds by Medallion Bank to certain of its affiliates, including us, in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or purchases of assets and restrict its ability to provide services to, or receive services from, its affiliates. Sections 23A and 23B also require generally that Medallion Bank's transactions with its affiliates be on terms no less favorable to Medallion Bank than comparable transactions with unrelated third parties. If and to the extent that the Company remains a BDC under the 1940 Act, our ability to enter into certain transactions with our affiliates is restricted. See ""Risks Associated with Our Operations as a BDC -  The 1940 Act restricts our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates."" 29 Table of Contents Our Board of Directors may change our operating policies and strategies without prior notice or shareholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse. Our Board of Directors has the authority to modify or waive our current operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without shareholder approval. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results, and value of our stock. However, the effects might be adverse, which could negatively impact our ability to pay you distributions and cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Risks Associated with Our Operations as a BDC On March 7, 2018, a majority of the Company's shareholders authorized the Company's Board of Directors to withdraw the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and our Board of Directors approved the filing of the Company's withdrawal form with the SEC to be made on or about April 1, 2018. At that point, we would no longer be a BDC or be subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs. If and to the extent that the Company remains a BDC under the 1940 Act, the following discussion is a summary of the material risks associated with our operations as a BDC. We operate in a highly regulated environment, and if we are found to be in violation of any of the 1940 Act, our business could suffer. The 1940 Act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of BDC's. For example, BDC's are required to invest at least 70% of their total assets in qualifying assets, primarily securities of ""eligible portfolio companies"" (as defined under the 1940 Act), cash, cash equivalents, US government securities, and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Our regulatory requirements may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and, as a result, achieve our investment objective. In addition, we rely upon several exemptive orders from the SEC permitting us to consolidate our financial reporting and operate our business as presently conducted. Our failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in those exemptive orders could result in our inability to rely upon such orders or to cause the SEC to revoke the orders which could result in material changes in our financial reporting or the way in which we conduct our business. Furthermore, any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDC's by the 1940 Act could have material adverse consequences to us or our investors, including possible enforcement action by the SEC. Regulations governing our operation as a BDC may affect our ability to, and the way in which, we raise additional capital. Senior Securities and Other Indebtedness. We may issue debt securities or preferred stock, and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as senior securities, up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. If we issue senior securities, including debt or preferred stock, we will be exposed to additional risks, including the following: <U+0095>   Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a BDC, to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be restricted from issuing additional debt, may be limited in making distributions on our stock, and may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, to repay a portion of our debt at a time when such sales and/or repayments may be disadvantageous. In addition to the 1940 Act, we are subject to two exemptive orders which govern how we calculate our senior securities and under which we have agreed that we will meet the applicable asset coverage ratios both individually and on a consolidated basis. As of December 31, 2017, our asset coverage was approximately 306%, calculated on a consolidated basis, and 296% calculated on an unconsolidated basis. Additional Common Stock. We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value (less any distributing commission or discount) per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, warrants, options, or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our shareholders, and our shareholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). We may also make rights offerings to our shareholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Since our investments in assets that are not ""qualifying assets"" exceeded 30% of our total assets as of December 31, 2017, we are precluded from making any follow-on investments in Medallion Bank and our City of Chicago taxicab medallions purchased out of foreclosure, and could be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 30 Table of Contents As a business development company, we are not permitted to acquire any assets other than ""qualifying assets"" unless, at the time of such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Our investment in Medallion Bank and City of Chicago taxicab medallions purchased out of foreclosure, which are carried in investments other than securities on the consolidated balance sheet, are non-qualifying assets. As of December 31, 2017, the percentage of our total assets that were invested in non-qualifying assets were up to 58.7% on an unconsolidated basis and up to 47.6% on a consolidated basis. We did not satisfy the requirement that no more than 30% of our total assets be comprised of non-qualifying assets, and are currently not permitted to acquire any non-qualifying assets. We are therefore unable to make any investments in non-qualifying assets, including follow-on investments in Medallion Bank and our City of Chicago taxicab medallions purchased out of foreclosure. As a result of such failure, we could also be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments or could be required to dispose of non-qualifying assets at times or on terms that may be disadvantageous to us. We would also not be able to support Medallion Bank's capital requirements, if any, and Medallion Bank may also not be able to grow as quickly because we are precluded from providing additional funding to Medallion Bank. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on us. If we purchase a non-qualifying asset after failing to satisfy the requirement that no more than 30% of our total assets be comprised of non-qualifying assets, then we would be deemed to be in violation of the 1940 Act and the violation could also result in an event of default on our debt obligations. Our investment portfolio is, and will continue to be, recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors and, as a result, there is, and will continue to be, uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments which could adversely affect our net asset value. Under the 1940 Act, we are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value as determined by our Board of Directors. Unlike other lending institutions, we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses. Instead, we are required by the 1940 Act to specifically value each individual investment and record an unrealized gain or loss for any asset we believe has increased or decreased in value. Typically, there is not a public market for most of the investments in which we have invested and will generally continue to invest. As a result, our Board of Directors values our investments on a quarterly basis based on a determination of their fair value made in good faith and in accordance with the written guidelines approved by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors regularly review the appropriateness and accuracy of the method used in valuing our investments, and makes any necessary adjustments. The types of factors that may be considered in determining the fair value pricing of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's earnings and its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, market conditions for loans (e.g., values used by other lenders and any active bid/ask market), comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow, comparable sales and valuations of companies similar to the portfolio company, regulatory factors that may limit the value of the portfolio company, and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, the valuations may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates. As a result, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed, and may cause our net asset value on a given date to materially understate or overstate the value that we may ultimately realize upon the sale or disposition of one or more of our investments. Investors purchasing our securities in connection with an offering based on an overstated net asset value would pay a higher price than the value of our investments might warrant, and investors purchasing our securities in connection with an offering based on an understated net asset value would pay a lower price than the value of our investments might warrant. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities. Considering these factors, we have determined that the fair value of our portfolio is above its cost basis. As of December 31, 2017, our net unrealized appreciation on investments was $141,190,000 or 30% of our investment portfolio at cost, and the depreciation on our investments other than securities and other assets was $1,490,000 or 16% of our investments other than securities and other assets at cost. The 1940 Act restricts our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates. The 1940 Act restricts our ability to knowingly participate in certain transactions with our affiliates. These restrictions limit our ability to buy or sell any security from or to our affiliates, or engage in ""joint"" transactions with our affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times). With respect to controlling or certain closely affiliated persons, we will generally be prohibited from engaging in such transactions absent the prior approval of the SEC. With respect to other affiliated persons, we may engage in such transactions only with the prior approval of our independent directors. 31 Table of Contents Risks Relating to Our Investments Lending to small businesses involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative. Lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk, which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative. Our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that may have limited resources and that are generally unable to obtain financing from traditional sources. There is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners, and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions. In addition, these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements. Some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition. Therefore, they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences, market conditions, or economic downturns, which may adversely affect the return on, or the recovery of, our investment in these businesses. Our portfolio is and may continue to be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, and industries and sectors, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations to us or by a downturn in the particular industry or sector. Our portfolio is and may continue to be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, and industries and sectors. In addition, taxicab companies that constitute separate issuers may have related management or guarantors and constitute larger business relationships to us. As of December 31, 2017, investments in New York City taxi medallion loans represented approximately 81% of our managed taxi medallion loans, which in turn represented 28% of our managed net investment portfolio. We do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and while we are not targeting any specific industries, our investments are, and could continue to be, concentrated in relatively few industries. As a result, the aggregate returns we realize may be adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. If our larger borrowers were to significantly reduce their relationships with us and seek financing elsewhere, the size of our loan portfolio and operating results could decrease. In addition, larger business relationships may also impede our ability to immediately foreclose on a particular defaulted portfolio company as we may not want to impair an overall business relationship with either the portfolio company management or any related funding source. Additionally, a downturn in any particular industry or sector in which we are invested could also negatively impact the aggregate returns we realize. If we are unable to continue to diversify geographically, our business may be further adversely affected if the New York City taxicab industry experiences a sustained economic downturn. A significant portion of our loan revenue is derived from medallion loans collateralized by New York City taxicab medallions. An economic downturn in the New York City taxicab industry could lead to an additional increase in defaults on our medallion loans. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sufficiently diversify our operations geographically. An economic downturn could result in additional commercial and consumer loan customers experiencing declines in business activities and/or personal resources, which could lead to difficulties in their servicing of their loans with us, and increasing the level of delinquencies, defaults, and loan losses in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. Laws and regulations implemented in response to climate change could result in increased operating costs for our portfolio companies. Congress and other governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations in response to climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gases. Existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations could be adopted, and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur, which could impose additional costs on the operation of our portfolio companies. For example, regulations to cut gasoline use and control greenhouse gas emissions from new cars could adversely affect our medallion portfolio companies. Our portfolio companies may have to make significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Changes in, or new, environmental restrictions may force our portfolio companies to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed their estimates. There can be no assurance that such companies would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from their customers or that their business, financial condition or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in environmental laws and regulations, in which case the value of these companies could be adversely affected. 32 Table of Contents Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies. We invest in our portfolio companies primarily through senior secured loans, junior secured loans, and subordinated debt issued by small- to mid-sized companies. Our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company. A third party finance company sold various participations in asset based loans to Medallion Business Credit and Medallion Bank. In April 2013, the aggregate balance of the participations was approximately $13.8 million, $12.9 million of which were held by Medallion Bank. That amount was divided between seven separate borrowers operating in a variety of industries. In April 2013, the third party finance company became the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed by its bank lenders. Among other things, the bank lenders alleged that the third party finance company fraudulently misrepresented its borrowing availability under its credit facility with the bank lenders and are seeking the third party finance company's liquidation. In May 2013, the bankruptcy court presiding over the third party finance company's case entered an order converting the involuntary Chapter 7 case to a Chapter 11 case. On May 31, 2013, we commenced an adverse proceeding against the third party finance company and the bank lenders seeking declaratory judgment that our loan participations are true participations and not subject to the bankruptcy estate or to the bank lender's security interest in the third party finance company's assets. The third party finance company and bank lenders are contesting our position. In April 2014, we received a decision from the court granting summary judgment in our favor with respect to the issue of whether our loan participations are true participations. In March 2015, we and Medallion Bank received a decision from the court finding that the bank lenders generally held a first lien on our and Medallion Bank's loan participations subject to, among other things, defenses still pending prosecution by the parties and adjudication by the court. We and Medallion Bank are appealing the decision. The remaining issues are still being litigated. Although we believe the claims raised by the third party finance company and the senior lenders are without merit and will vigorously defend against them, we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or determine our potential exposure. If we are incorrect in our assessments our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. At December 31, 2017, five of the seven secured borrowers had refinanced their loans in full with third parties, and the related proceeds are held in escrow pending resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. In September 2015, one loan was sold at a discount to a third party, and the related proceeds are held in escrow pending resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. One loan was charged off in September 2014. See page 43 for additional information regarding this matter. There may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims. Even though we may have structured most of our investments as senior loans, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt investment and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a borrower's business or instances where we exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we could become subject to a lender's liability claim, including as a result of actions taken in rendering significant managerial assistance. We may not control many of our portfolio companies. We may not control many of our portfolio companies, even though we may have board representation or board observation rights, and our debt agreements may contain certain restrictive covenants. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the management of such company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors. We may not realize gains from our equity investments. Certain investments that we have made in the past and may make in the future include warrants or other equity securities. In addition, we may from time to time make non-control, equity co-investments in companies in conjunction with private equity sponsors. Our goal is ultimately to realize gains upon our disposition of such equity interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. We also may be unable to realize any value if a portfolio company does not have a liquidity event, such as a sale of the business, recapitalization, or public offering, which would allow us to sell the underlying equity interests. 33 Table of Contents","ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. In addition, this section contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements are described in the Risk Factors section on page 19. Additionally, more information about our business activities can be found in ""Business"". CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The SEC has issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies. The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Significant estimates made by us include valuation of loans, equity investments, and investments in subsidiaries, evaluation of the recoverability of accounts receivable and income tax assets, and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies. The matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and may require complex and subjective judgments. Although we believe that estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in our financial statements. GENERAL We are a specialty finance company that has historically had a leading position in originating, acquiring, and servicing loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial businesses. Recently, our strategic growth has been through a wholly-owned portfolio company of ours, Medallion Bank, which originates consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats, motorcycles, and trailers, and to finance small-scale home improvements. Since Medallion Bank acquired a consumer loan portfolio and began originating consumer loans in 2004, it has increased its consumer loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Since 1996, the year in which we became a public company, we have increased our taxicab medallion loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 2%, and our commercial loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 4% (5% and 4% on a managed basis when combined with Medallion Bank). In January 2017, we announced our plans to transform our overall strategy. We are transitioning away from medallion lending and placing our strategic focus on our growing consumer finance portfolio. Total assets under our management and the management of our unconsolidated wholly-owned subsidiaries, which includes our managed net investment portfolio, as well as assets serviced for third party investors, were $1,593,000,000 as of December 31, 2017 and $1,632,000,000 as of December 31, 2016 and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 10% from $215,000,000 at the end of 1996. Our loan-related earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the total yield on our loan portfolio and the average cost of borrowed funds. We fund our operations through a wide variety of interest-bearing sources, such as revolving bank facilities, bank certificates of deposit issued to customers, debentures issued to and guaranteed by the SBA, and bank term debt. Net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on our loan portfolio and changes in the cost of borrowed funds, as well as changes in the amount of interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities held by us. Net interest income is also affected by economic, regulatory, and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, and the availability of funding to finance our lending activities. We, like other financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-earning assets reprice on a different basis than our interest-bearing liabilities. We also provide debt, mezzanine, and equity investment capital to companies in a variety of industries, consistent with our investment objectives. These investments may be venture capital style investments which may not be fully collateralized. Medallion Capital's investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by an equity stake or warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price (such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets). Interest income is earned on the debt instruments. We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company, organized as a Delaware corporation, under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated as a BDC, under the 1940 Act. On March 7, 2018, a majority of the Company's shareholders authorized the Company's Board of Directors to withdraw the Company's election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and our Board of Directors approved the filing of the Company's withdrawal form with the SEC to be made on or about April 1, 2018. At that point, we would no longer be a BDC or be subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs. 39 Table of Contents For our tax years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and therefore we became subject to taxation as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Code. We had in previous years qualified and elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC. As a RIC, we generally did not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we distributed to our shareholders as dividends, if we met certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. Medallion Bank is not a RIC and must pay corporate-level US federal and state income taxes. See Note 5 for more information. Our wholly-owned portfolio company, Medallion Bank, is a bank regulated by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions which originates consumer loans, raises deposits, and conducts other banking activities. Medallion Bank generally provides us with our lowest cost of funds which it raises through bank certificates of deposit. To take advantage of this low cost of funds, historically we have referred a portion of our taxicab medallion and commercial loans to Medallion Bank, who originated these loans, and have been serviced by MSC. However, at this time Medallion Bank is not originating any new taxi medallion loans and is working with MSC to service its existing portfolio. The FDIC restricts the amount of taxicab medallion loans that Medallion Bank may finance to three times Tier 1 capital, or $491,391,000 as of December 31, 2017. MSC earns referral and servicing fees for these activities. As a non-investment company, Medallion Bank is not consolidated with the Company. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC, as expected, commencing with the second quarter of 2018, the Company would no longer be subject to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services  -  Investment Companies, which would result in a significant change in our accounting and financial reporting requirements. Our financial statements are currently presented and accounted for under the specialized method of accounting applicable to investment companies, which requires us to recognize our investments, including controlled investments, at fair value. As a BDC, we are currently precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company that acts as an extension of our investment operations and facilitates the execution of our investment strategy or an investment in a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services to us. Our financial statements currently consolidate the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned investment company subsidiaries, except for Medallion Bank and other portfolio investments. Our financial statements reflect our investment in Medallion Bank and other portfolio investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Medallion Bank's financial statements are separately provided as a significant unconsolidated wholly-owned subsidiary. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC, the Company will consolidate the financial statements of Medallion Bank and controlled or majority-owned portfolio investments together with those of the Company. Realized gains or losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold or written off. The realized gains or losses represent the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio assets, if any, and the cost of such portfolio assets. In addition, changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments are recorded and represent the net change in the estimated fair values of the portfolio assets at the end of the period as compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period. Generally, realized gains (losses) on investments and changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments are inversely related. When an appreciated asset is sold to realize a gain, a decrease in the previously recorded unrealized appreciation occurs. Conversely, when a loss previously recorded as unrealized depreciation is realized by the sale or other disposition of a depreciated portfolio asset, the reclassification of the loss from unrealized to realized causes a decrease in net unrealized depreciation and an increase in realized loss. Our investment in Medallion Bank, as a wholly owned portfolio investment, is also subject to quarterly assessments of fair value. We conduct a thorough valuation analysis as discussed previously, and determine whether any factors give rise to a valuation different than recorded book value, including various regulatory restrictions that were established at Medallion Bank's inception, by the FDIC and State of Utah, and also by additional marketplace restrictions, such as the ability to transfer industrial bank charters. Because of these restrictions and other factors, our Board of Directors had previously determined that Medallion Bank had little value beyond its recorded book value. As a result of this valuation process, we had previously used Medallion Bank's actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value, and recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. In the second quarter of 2015, we first became aware of external interest in Medallion Bank and its portfolio assets at values in excess of their book value. Expression of interest in Medallion Bank from both investment bankers and interested parties has continued through 2016 and 2017. We incorporated these new factors in the Medallion Bank fair value analysis, and the Board of Directors determined that Medallion Bank had a fair value in excess of book value. In addition, in the third quarter of 2016 there was a court ruling involving a marketplace lender that the Company believes heightens the interest of marketplace lenders to acquire or merge with Utah industrial banks. We also engaged a valuation specialist to assist the Board of Directors in its determination of Medallion Bank's fair value, and this appreciation of $15,500,000 was thereby recorded in 2015, and additional appreciation of $128,918,000 was recorded in 2016 and $7,849,000 was recorded in 2017.

(2) The weighted average interest rate for the entire managed loan portfolio (medallion, commercial, and consumer loans) was 10.89%, 9.74%, and 9.03% at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. 41 Table of Contents PORTFOLIO SUMMARY Total Portfolio Yield The weighted average yield (which is calculated by dividing the aggregate yield of each investment in the portfolio by the aggregate portfolio balance and does not include expenses and sales load for any offering) of the total portfolio at December 31, 2017 was 4.73% (6.58% for the loan portfolio), a decrease of 24 basis points from 4.97% at December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of 209 basis points from 7.06% at December 31, 2015. The decreased yield from 2015 was primarily attributable to the decreased yield in our investment in Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries. The weighted average yield of the total managed portfolio at December 31, 2017 was 10.61% (10.89% for the loan portfolio), an increase of 111 basis points from 9.50% at December 31, 2016, which was an increase of 97 basis points from 8.53% at December 31, 2015. The increased yield of the total managed portfolio was mainly due to the higher yield of the total managed commercial portfolio, driven by our exit from the asset-based lending business which had a lower average yield in comparison to our mezzanine and other secured commercial loans, and the higher yield of our consumer loans. Medallion Loan Portfolio Our medallion loans comprised 34% of the net portfolio of $610,135,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to 41% of the net portfolio of $652,278,000 at December 31, 2016, and 51% of $606,959,000 at December 31, 2015. Our managed medallion loans of $388,001,000 comprised 28% of the net managed portfolio of $1,380,054,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to 35% the net managed portfolio of $1,517,592,000 at December 31, 2016, and 43% of $1,501,555,000 at December 31, 2015. The medallion loan portfolio decreased by $58,537,000 or 22% in 2017 (and decreased by $140,642,000 or 27% on a managed basis). The decreases in outstandings were primarily concentrated in the New York and Chicago markets, although all markets declined, and reflected increased realized and unrealized losses and net amortization of loan principal. Total medallion loans serviced for third parties were $26,349,000, $24,796,000, and $26,959,000 at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. The weighted average yield of the medallion loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 was 4.41%, an increase of 40 basis points from 4.01% at December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of 8 basis points from 4.09% at December 31, 2015. The weighted average yield of the managed medallion loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 was 4.36%, an increase of 48 basis points from 3.88% at December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of 8 basis points from 3.96% at December 31, 2015. The fluctuation in yield primarily reflected the repricing of the existing portfolio to current market interest rates. At December 31, 2017, 27% of the medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside New York, compared to 31% at year-end 2016 and 2015. At December 31, 2017, 19% of the managed medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside New York, compared to 24% and 26% at year-end 2016 and 2015. Commercial Loan Portfolio Our commercial loans represented 15% of the net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to 13% and 14% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and were 7%, 6%, and 8% on a managed basis. Commercial loans increased by $6,554,000 or 8% during 2017 (increased by $5,583,000 or 6% on a managed basis), primarily reflecting the growth in the mezzanine loan portfolio. Net commercial loans serviced for third parties were $747,000 at December 31, 2017 and $1,644,000 at December 31, 2016, and serviced by third parties were $3,419,000 at December 31, 2015. The weighted average yield of the commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 was 12.02%, a decrease of 103 basis points from 13.05% at December 31, 2016, which was an increase of 25 basis points from 12.80% at December 31, 2015. The weighted average yield of the managed commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 was 11.85%, a decrease of 91 basis points from 12.76% at December 31, 2016, which was an increase of 258 basis points from 10.18% at December 31, 2015. The decreases primarily reflected the recent lower rates on certain of the mezzanine loans. At December 31, 2017, variable-rate loans represented 0% of the commercial portfolio, compared to 7% and 9% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and were 0%, 7%, and 38% on a managed basis. Consumer Loan Portfolio Our managed consumer loans, all of which are held in the portfolio managed by Medallion Bank, represented 49% of the managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017, compared to 46% and 41% at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Medallion Bank originates fixed rate consumer loans secured by recreational vehicles, boats, trailers, and home improvements located in all 50 states. The portfolio is serviced by a third party subsidiary. 42 Table of Contents The consumer loans declined by $17,183,000 or 2% during 2017, reflecting the sale of $221,000,000 of consumer loans to a third party investor in 2017, partially offset by strong origination growth during the year. The weighted average gross yield of the managed consumer loan portfolio was 15.02% at December 31, 2017, compared to 14.27% and 14.06% at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase in yield primarily reflected the sales in 2017 of $221,000,000 of mostly lower-yielding home improvement loans. Adjustable rate loans represented 7% of the managed consumer portfolio at December 31, 2017, compared to 12% and 20% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, reflecting Medallion Bank no longer offering variable rate recreation loans since January 2014. Delinquency and Loan Loss Experience We generally follow a practice of discontinuing the accrual of interest income on our loans that are in arrears as to payments for a period of 90 days or more. We deliver a default notice and begin foreclosure and liquidation proceedings when management determines that pursuit of these remedies is the most appropriate course of action under the circumstances. A loan is considered to be delinquent if the borrower fails to make a payment on time; however, during the course of discussion on delinquent status, we may agree to modify the payment terms of the loan with a borrower that cannot make payments in accordance with the original loan agreement. For loan modifications, the loan will only be returned to accrual status if all past due interest and principal payments are brought fully current. For credit that is collateral based, we evaluate the anticipated net residual value we would receive upon foreclosure of such loans, if necessary. There can be no assurance, however, that the collateral securing these loans will be adequate in the event of foreclosure. For credit that is cash flow-based, we assess our collateral position, and evaluate most of these relationships as ongoing businesses, expecting to locate and install a new operator to run the business and reduce the debt. For the consumer loan portfolio, the process to repossess the collateral is started at 60 days past due. If the collateral is not located and the account reaches 120 days delinquent, the account is charged off to realized losses. If the collateral is repossessed, a realized loss is recorded to write the collateral down to its net realizable value, and the collateral is sent to auction. When the collateral is sold, the net auction proceeds are applied to the account, and any remaining balance is written off as a realized loss, and any excess proceeds are recorded as a realized gain. Proceeds collected on charged off accounts are recorded as realized gains. All collection, repossession, and recovery efforts are handled on behalf of Medallion Bank by the servicer. The following table shows the trend in loans 90 days or more past due as of December 31. 2017     2016     2015   (Dollars in thousands)    Amount      %(1)     Amount      %(1)     Amount      %(1)   Medallion loans    $ 59,701        18.7 %    $ 71,976        18.9 %    $ 11,880          3.0 %                                                                  Commercial loans                                   Secured mezzanine       -           0.0       1,390        0.4       1,390        0.4   Other secured commercial      749        0.2       734        0.2       945        0.2                                                                   Total commercial loans      749        0.2       2,124        0.6       2,335        0.6                                                                   Total loans 90 days or more past due    $ 60,450        18.9 %    $ 74,100        19.5 %    $ 14,215        3.6 %                                                                  Total Medallion Bank loans    $ 16,115        1.8 %    $ 42,269        4.2 %    $ 17,154        1.7 %                                                                  Total managed loans 90 days or more past due    $ 76,565        6.2 %    $ 116,369        8.4 %    $ 31,369        2.2 % (1) Percentages are calculated against the total or managed loan portfolio, as appropriate. A third party finance company sold various participations in asset based loans to Medallion Business Credit and Medallion Bank. In April 2013, the aggregate balance of the participations was approximately $13.8 million, $12.9 million of which were held by Medallion Bank. That amount was divided between seven separate borrowers operating in a variety of industries. In April 2013, the third party finance company became the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition filed by its bank lenders. Among other things, the bank lenders alleged that the third party finance company fraudulently misrepresented its borrowing availability under its credit facility with the bank lenders and are seeking the third party finance company's liquidation. In May 2013, the bankruptcy court presiding over the third party finance company's case entered an order converting the involuntary chapter 7 case to a chapter 11 case. We and Medallion Bank have placed these loans on nonaccrual, and reversed interest income. In addition, we have established valuation allowances against the outstanding balances. On May 31, 2013, we commenced an adverse proceeding against the third party finance company and the bank lenders seeking declaratory judgment that our loan participations are true participations and not subject to the bankruptcy estate or to the bank lender's security interest in the third party finance company's assets. The third party finance company and bank lenders are contesting our position. In April 2014, we and Medallion Bank received a decision from the court granting summary judgment in our favor with respect to the issue of whether our loan participations are true participations. In 43 Table of Contents March 2015, we and Medallion Bank received a decision from the court finding that the bank lenders generally held a first lien on our and Medallion Bank's loan participations subject to, among other things, defenses still pending prosecution by the parties and adjudication by the court. We and Medallion Bank are appealing the decision. The remaining issues are still being litigated. Although we believe the claims raised by the third party finance company and the bank lenders are without merit and will vigorously defend against them, we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this litigation or determine our potential exposure. At December 31, 2017, five of the seven secured borrowers had refinanced their loans in full with third parties, and the related proceeds are held in escrow pending resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. In September 2015, one loan was sold at a discount to a third party, and the related proceeds are held in escrow pending resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings. One loan was charged off in September 2014. The balances related to the paid off loans have been reclassified to other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The table below summarizes these receivables and their status with the Company and Medallion Bank.

The recent increases in medallion delinquencies reflected our borrowers experiencing declining cash flows due to competitive internet ride hailing services and decreases in medallion values putting stress on certain of our borrowers, all of whom we continue to work with. We have vigorously pursued strategies to offset these declines which have included adding personnel to the collection staff, receiving principal reductions as loans renew, and requiring additional collateral so as to offer temporary solutions until cash flows improve. Additionally, we have had some success in assisting delinquent customers in selling their medallions to new owners putting a reasonable amount of cash equity into the sale so as to reduce our exposure on the collateral. This in turn has improved the overall cash flow to debt service ratio. Medallion Bank delinquencies have declined during 2017 due to an increase in medallion loan charge-offs during the year. We monitor delinquent loans for possible exposure to loss by analyzing various factors, including the value of the collateral securing the loan and the borrower's prior payment history. Under the 1940 Act, our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or ""marked-to-market."" Unlike other lending institutions, we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses. Instead, the valuation of our portfolio is adjusted quarterly to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio. Since no ready market exists for this portfolio, fair value is subject to the good faith determination of our Board of Directors. Because of the subjectivity of these estimates, there can be no assurance that in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet. In determining the value of our portfolio, the Board of Directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral. For example, in a period of sustained increases in market interest rates, the Board of Directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of long-term, fixed-rate loans. Our valuation procedures are designed to generate values that approximate that which would have been established by market forces, and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results. Based upon these factors, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is determined, based on the fluctuations of our estimate of the current realizable value of our portfolio from our cost basis. The following table sets forth the pretax changes in our unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. 44 Table of Contents (Dollars in thousands)    Medallion Loans     Commercial Loans     Investments in Subsidiaries     Equity Investments     Investment Securities     Investments Other Than Securities     Total   Balance December 31, 2014    $  -        ($ 2,949 )    $ 5,698     $ 1,608     $  -        $ 38,645     $ 43,002   Net change in unrealized                                     Appreciation on investments       -           -          18,132       1,141        -          (9,621 )      9,652   Depreciation on investments      (3,568 )      (176 )      586       (1,426 )      (18 )      (68 )      (4,670 )  Reversal of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) related to realized                                     Gains on investments       -           -          (4,809 )      (9 )       -           -          (4,818 )  Losses on investments      130       886        -          301             -          1,317   Other (1)       -           -          (967 )      967        -           -           -                                                                             Balance December 31, 2015      (3,438 )      (2,239 )      18,640       2,582       (18 )      28,956       44,483   Net change in unrealized                                     Appreciation on investments       -           -          133,805       2,979       7       (28,372 )      108,419   Depreciation on investments      (28,028 )      318       305        -          5        -          (27,400 )  Reversal of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) related to realized                                     Gains on investments       -           -           -          (1,627 )       -           -          (1,627 )  Losses on investments      2,943       543        -           -          12        -          3,498   Other       -           -           -           -          (6 )       -          (6 )                                                                         Balance December 31, 2016      (28,523 )      (1,378 )      152,750       3,934        -          584       127,367   Net change in unrealized                                     Appreciation on investments       -           -          6,170       2,060        -          (821 )      7,409   Depreciation on investments      (37,335 )      (410 )       -          (277 )       -          (1,253 )      (39,275 )  Reversal of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) related to realized                                     Gains on investments       -           -           -          (3,082 )       -           -          (3,082 )  Losses on investments      45,520       1,275        -          486        -           -          47,281   Other       -           -           -           -           -           -           -                                                                             Balance December 31, 2017    ($ 20,338 )    ($ 513 )    $ 158,920     $ 3,121     $  -        ($ 1,490 )    $ 139,700 (1) Reclassification of Medallion Motorsports from equity investments to controlled subsidiaries. 45 Table of Contents The following table presents credit-related information for the investment portfolios as of December 31.

The portfolio company investments primarily represent the wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiaries of ours, substantially all of which is represented by our investment in Medallion Bank. In addition, to facilitate maintenance of Medallion Bank's capital ratio requirement and to provide the necessary capital for continued growth, we periodically make capital contributions to Medallion Bank, including $3,000,000 in 2016 and $8,000,000 in 2015. Separately, Medallion Bank declared dividends to us of $3,000,000 in 2016 and $18,000,000 in 2015. See Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these investments. Equity Investments Equity investments were 2% of our total portfolio at December 31, 2017, and were 1% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Equity investments were 1%, 1%, and less than 1% of our total managed portfolio at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Equity investments are comprised of common stock, warrants, preferred stock, and limited partnership interests. Investment Securities Investment securities were 0%, 0%, and 8% of our total portfolio at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Investment securities were 3%, 2%, and 6% of our total managed portfolio at December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. The investment securities are primarily U.S. Treasury bills and adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities purchased by us and Medallion Bank to better utilize required cash liquidity. Trend in Interest Expense Our interest expense is driven by the interest rates payable on our short-term credit facilities with banks, bank certificates of deposit, fixed-rate, long-term debentures issued to the SBA, and other short-term notes payable. We established a medallion lending relationship with DZ Bank in December 2008 that provided for growth in the portfolio at generally lower rates than under prior facilities. In addition, Medallion Bank began raising brokered bank certificates of deposit during 2004, which were at our lowest borrowing costs. As a result of Medallion Bank raising funds through certificates of deposit as previously noted, we were able to transfer certain of our medallion loans and related assets to Medallion Bank allowing us and our subsidiaries to use cash generated through these transactions to retire debt with higher interest rates. In addition, Medallion Bank is able to bid on these deposits at a wide variety of maturity levels which allows for improved interest rate management strategies. Our cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on our various debt instruments and their relative mix, and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of all outstanding debt. Our debentures issued to the SBA typically have terms of ten years. 48 Table of Contents We measure our borrowing costs as our aggregate interest expense for all of our interest-bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period. The following table shows the average borrowings and related borrowing costs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Our average balances decreased during the year reflecting the fluctuations in the investment portfolio and Medallions Bank's average decreased, mainly reflecting the sale of $221,000,000 of consumer loans to a third party, offset by strong growth in the consumer loan portfolio. The increase in borrowing costs reflected the increase of interest rates and changes in our borrowing mix, and Medallion Bank's lengthening of the maturity profile of its certificates of deposit.

SBA financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur. We use SBA funding to fund loans that qualify under the SBIA and SBA regulations. We believe that financing operations primarily with short-term floating rate secured bank debt has generally decreased our interest expense, but has also increased our exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates, which we mitigate with certain interest rate strategies. At December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, short-term adjustable rate debt constituted 55%, 59%, and 75% of total debt, and was 15%, 16%, and 23% on a fully managed basis including the borrowings of Medallion Bank. Factors Affecting Net Assets Factors that affect our net assets include net realized gain or loss on investments and change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds derived upon sale or foreclosure of a loan or an equity investment and the cost basis of such loan or equity investment. Change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the amount, if any, by which our estimate of the fair value of our investment portfolio is above or below the previously established fair value or the cost basis of the portfolio. Under the 1940 Act, our loan portfolio and other investments must be recorded at fair value. 49 Table of Contents Unlike certain lending institutions, we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses, but adjust quarterly the valuation of the investment portfolio to reflect our estimate of the current value of the total investment portfolio. Since no ready market exists for our investments, fair value is subject to our Board of Directors' good faith determination. In determining such fair value, our Board of Directors considers factors such as the financial condition of our borrowers and the adequacy of their collateral. Any change in the fair value of portfolio investments or other investments as determined by our Board of Directors is reflected in net unrealized depreciation or appreciation on investments and affects net increase in net assets resulting from operations, but has no impact on net investment income or distributable income. Our investment in Medallion Bank, as a wholly-owned portfolio investment, is also subject to quarterly assessments of fair value. We conduct a thorough valuation analysis as described previously, and also receive an opinion regarding the valuation from an independent third party to assist the Board of Directors in its determination of the fair value of Medallion Bank on at least an annual basis. Our analysis includes factors such as various regulatory restrictions that were established at Medallion Bank's inception, by the FDIC and State of Utah, and also by additional regulatory restrictions, such as the prior moratorium imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act on the acquisition of control of an industrial bank by a ""commercial firm"" (a company whose gross revenues are primarily derived from nonfinancial activities) which expired in July 2013 and the lack of any new charter issuances since the moratorium's expiration. Because of these restrictions and other factors, our Board of Directors had previously determined that Medallion Bank had little value beyond its recorded book value. As a result of this valuation process, we had previously used Medallion Bank's actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value, and recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. In the 2015 second quarter we first became aware of external interest in Medallion Bank and its portfolio assets at values in excess of their book value. Expression of interest in Medallion Bank from both investment bankers and interested parties has continued through 2016 and 2017. We incorporated these new factors in the Medallion Bank's fair value analysis and Board of Directors determined that Medallion Bank had a fair value in excess of book value. In addition, in the 2016 third quarter there was a court ruling involving a marketplace lender that we believe heightens the interest of marketplace lenders to acquire or merge with Utah industrial banks. We also engaged a valuation specialist to assist the Board of Directors in its determination of Medallion Bank's fair value, and this appreciation of $15,500,000 was thereby recorded in 2015, and additional appreciation of $128,918,000 was recorded in 2016 and $7,849,000 was recorded in 2017. See Note 3 for additional information about Medallion Bank. Consolidated Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $278,000 or $0.01 per diluted common share in 2017, down $23,237,000 or 99% from $23,515,000 or $0.97 per share in 2016, primarily reflecting an increase in net realized/unrealized losses on the investment portfolio and lower net interest income, partially offset by an increased income tax benefit and lower operating expenses. Net investment loss after income taxes was $7,121,000 or $0.30 per share in 2017, down $7,240,000 from income of $119,000 or less than $0.01 in 2016. Investment income was $19,624,000 in 2017, down $5,464,000 or 22% from $25,088,000 a year ago, and included in 2017 and 2016 were $1,278,000 and $3,000,000 in dividends from Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries. The decrease was also due to $5,514,000 of interest forgone in 2017, compared to $2,634,000 in 2016. The yield on the investment portfolio was 3.12% in 2017, down 25% from was 4.17% in 2016. Excluding the dividends, the 2017 yield was down 20% to 2.92% from 3.67% in 2016, reflecting the above. Average investments outstanding were $629,089,000 in 2017, up 4% from $602,349,000 in the prior year primarily reflecting growth in the commercial portfolio and subsidiary investments. Medallion loans were $208,279,000 at year end, down $58,537,000 or 22% from $266,816,000 a year ago, representing 34% of the investment portfolio, compared to 41% a year ago, and were yielding 4.41% compared to 4.01% a year ago. The decrease in outstandings was primarily concentrated in the New York and Chicago markets, although all markets declined, and was primarily attributable to realized losses recognized and net amortization of loan principal. The managed medallion portfolio, which includes loans at Medallion Bank and those serviced for third parties, was $414,350,000 at year end, down $139,089,000 or 25% from $553,439,000 a year ago, reflecting the above, and realized losses taken and principal amortization at Medallion Bank. The commercial loan portfolio was $90,188,000 at year end, compared to $83,634,000 a year ago, an increase of $6,554,000 or 8%, and represented 15% of the investment portfolio compared to 13% a year ago. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in the secured mezzanine portfolio, partially offset by decreases in other secured commercial loans. Commercial loans yielded 12.02% at year end, down 8% from 13.05% a year ago, reflecting lower yields on certain recent loans. The net managed commercial loan portfolio, which includes loans at Medallion Bank and those serviced for or by third parties, was $92,530,000 at year end, up 50 Table of Contents $4,686,000 or 5% from $87,844,000 a year ago, reflecting the above. Investments in Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries were $302,147,000 at year end, up $8,787,000 or 3% from $293,360,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting the appreciation and equity in the earnings of Medallion Bank other portfolio company investments, capital contributions made, dividends paid, portfolio sales, and the net valuation adjustment, and which represented 49% of the investment portfolio at the end of 2017 and 45% in the prior year, and which yielded 0.83% at year end, compared to 2.13% a year ago, primarily reflecting reduced dividends from Medallion Bank. See Notes 3 and 11 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about Medallion Bank and the other controlled subsidiaries. Equity investments were $9,521,000 at year end, up $1,053,000 or 12% from $8,468,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting increase in investments held, and which represented 2% of the investment portfolio at the end of 2017 and 1% in the prior year, and had a dividend yield of 0% in both years. Interest expense was $13,770,000 in 2017, up $1,132,000 or 9% from $12,638,000 in 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased borrowing costs on floating rate borrowings. The cost of borrowed funds was 4.12% in 2017, compared to 3.32% a year ago, an increase of 24%, reflecting the recent increases in market interest rates. Average debt outstanding was $334,022,000 in 2017, compared to $380,305,000 a year ago, down 12%, primarily reflecting decreased borrowings required to fund the contracting medallion loan portfolio. See page 48 for a table that shows average balances and cost of funds for our funding sources. Net interest income was $5,854,000 and the net interest margin was 0.93% in 2017, down $6,596,000 or 53% from $12,450,000 a year ago, which represented a net interest margin of 2.07%, all reflecting the items discussed above. Noninterest income, which is comprised of prepayment fees, management fees, servicing fee income, late charges, and other miscellaneous income was $107,000 in 2017, down $301,000 or 74% from $408,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting lower management and other fees generated from the portfolios. Operating expenses were $13,810,000 in 2017, down $8,976,000 or 39% from $22,786,000 in 2016 which included a $5,099,000 goodwill write off. Salaries and benefits expense was $7,508,000 in the year, down $4,262,000 or 36% from $11,770,000 in 2016 primarily due to a reduction in bonus costs recorded in the current period and lower salary expenses due to the sale of its asset-based lending division in the prior year. Professional fees were $2,619,000 in 2017, up $272,000 or 12% from $2,347,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting higher legal and other professional fee expenses for a variety of corporate and investment-related matters. Occupancy expense was $1,069,000 in 2017, up $103,000 or 11% from $966,000 in 2016, primarily reflecting annual increases in rent expense at various locations. Other operating expenses of $2,614,000 in 2017 were down $10,000 from $2,604,000 a year ago reflecting decreased travel and entertainment expenses, directors' fees, miscellaneous taxes and reduced expense reimbursements, partially offset by increases in collection and other expenses. Total income tax benefit was $36,226,000 in 2017 compared to income tax expense of $45,900,000 in 2016, a change of $82,126,000. Total taxes were comprised of three components, a $728,000 benefit related net investment loss compared to $10,047,000 in 2016, benefits related to realized losses and unrealized appreciation on investments of $15,955,000 and $19,543,000, compared to provisions of $384,000 and $55,563,000 in 2016. The tax benefit recorded in 2017 reflected the $17,279,000 for adjustment to implement the change in US tax law rates on the net tax liabilities. See Note 5 for more information. Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments was $15,645,000 in 2017, compared to $78,886,000 in 2016, a decrease in appreciation of $63,241,000. Net change in unrealized appreciation other than the portion related to Medallion Bank and the other controlled subsidiaries, was appreciation of $6,162,000 in 2017 compared to a depreciation of $51,235,000 in 2016, resulting in increased appreciation of $57,397,000 in 2017. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) arises when we make valuation adjustments to the investment portfolio. When investments are sold or written off, any resulting realized gain (loss) is grossed up to reflect previously recorded unrealized components. As a result, movement between periods can appear distorted. The 2017 activity resulted from a net appreciation on Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries of $9,483,000, reversals of unrealized depreciation associated with charged off loans of $46,795,000, partially offset by unrealized depreciation on loans of $37,745,000, the reversal of unrealized appreciation on investments that were exited with a realized gain of $3,082,000, unrealized depreciation on investments other than securities and other assets of $2,075,000, and net unrealized appreciation on equity investments of $2,269,000. The 2016 activity resulted from net appreciation on Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries of $130,121,000 and by reversals of unrealized depreciation associated with charged off loans of $3,486,000, partially offset by unrealized depreciation on loans of $27,710,000, investments other than securities of $28,372,000, and net unrealized appreciation on investment securities of $1,367,000. The net appreciation on Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries described above is net of the dividends declared by them to us of $1,278,000 in 2017 and $3,000,000 in 2016. 51 Table of Contents Our net realized losses on investments were $43,744,000 in 2017 compared to gains of $457,000 in 2016, an increase in realized losses of $44,201,000 in 2017. The 2017 activity reflected the reversals described in the unrealized paragraph above, other gain on the liquidation of other investment securities of $4,684,000, and net loan chargeoffs of $4,715,000, inclusive of losses on equity investments. The 2016 activity reflected the reversals described in the unrealized paragraph above, and other net loan chargeoffs of $224,000, partially offset by gains of $2,111,000 from the sale of investment securities and $2,057,000 from the sale of the asset-based lending portfolio. Our net realized/unrealized gains on investments were $7,399,000 in 2017, compared to $23,396,000 in 2016, a decrease of $15,997,000 or 68% of net gains in the year, reflecting the above. For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $23,515,000 or $0.97 per diluted common share in 2016, down $5,861,000 or 20% from $29,376,000 or $1.20 per share in 2015, primarily reflecting an initial income tax provision that resulted from our not qualifying to elect RIC status for 2016, lower net interest income, and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher net realized/unrealized gains and noninterest income. Net investment income after income taxes was $119,000 or $0.00 per share in 2016, down $16,707,000 or 99% from $16,826,000 or $0.69 in 2015. Investment income was $25,088,000 in 2016, down $17,565,000 or 41% from $42,653,000 a year ago, and included in 2016 and 2015 were $3,000,000 and $18,889,000 in dividends from Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries. Excluding those items, investment income decreased $1,676,000 or 7%, primarily reflecting a $1,317,000 increase in foregone interest income on nonaccrual loans, and a $851,000 reduction in lease revenue from our owned Chicago medallions, in both cases, reflecting the poor performance of a number of our borrowers and lessees as business conditions have worsened. The yield on the investment portfolio was 4.17% in 2016, down 46% from 7.74% in 2015. Excluding the dividends, the 2016 yield was down 6% to 3.67% from 4.31% in 2015, reflecting the above. Average investments outstanding were $602,349,000 in 2016, up 9% from $550,763,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting the appreciation on Medallion Bank, partially offset by increased reserves and paydowns in the medallion portfolio. Medallion loans were $266,816,000 at year end, down $41,592,000 or 13% from $308,408,000 a year ago, representing 41% of the investment portfolio, compared to 51% a year ago, and were yielding 4.01% compared to 4.09% a year ago. The decrease in outstandings was primarily concentrated in the New York market, although all markets declined, and reflected increased realized and unrealized losses and net amortization of loan principal. The managed medallion portfolio, which includes loans at Medallion Bank and those serviced for third parties, was $553,439,000 at year end, down $114,582,000 or 17% from $667,863,000 a year ago, reflecting the above. The commercial loan portfolio was $83,634,000 at year end, compared to $81,895,000 a year ago, an increase of $1,739,000 or 2%, and represented 13% of the investment portfolio compared to 14% a year ago. The increase primarily reflected growth in the high-yield mezzanine portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the other secured commercial loan portfolio and the sale of the asset-based portfolio. Commercial loans yielded 13.05% at year end, up 2% from 12.80% a year ago, reflecting the change in portfolio mix and higher yields on the mezzanine portfolio. The net managed commercial loan portfolio, which includes loans at Medallion Bank and those serviced for or by third parties, was $87,844,000 at year end, down $34,619,000 or 28% from $122,463,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting the sale of the asset-based portfolio as well as the changes described above. Approximately $11,652,000 of managed asset-based loans ($6,991,000 after valuation adjustments) has been reclassified to other assets awaiting the outcome of legal proceedings as described further on page 43. Investments in Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries were $293,360,000 at year end, up $133,447,000 or 83% from $159,913,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting the appreciation and our equity in the earnings of Medallion Bank's other portfolio company investments, capital contributions made, dividends paid, portfolio sales, and the net valuation adjustments, and which represented 45% of the investment portfolio at the end of 2016 and 26% in the prior year, and which yielded 2.13% at year end, compared to 12.74% a year ago, primarily reflecting reduced dividends from Medallion Bank. See Notes 3 and 10 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about Medallion Bank and the other controlled subsidiaries. Equity investments were $8,468,000 at year end, up $1,609,000 or 23% from $6,859,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting increased net appreciation on investment, and which represented 1% of the investment portfolio at both year ends, and had a dividend yield of 0%, compared to 0.72% a year ago. Interest expense was $12,638,000 in 2016, up $3,216,000 or 34% from $9,422,000 in 2015. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased borrowing costs and higher borrowing levels. The cost of borrowed funds was 3.32% in 2016, compared to 2.60% a year ago, an increase of 28%, reflecting increases of interest rates and changes in our borrowing mix. Average debt outstanding was $380,305,000 in 2016, compared to $361,738,000 a year ago, up 5%, primarily reflecting increased borrowings required to fund operating and investment activity. See page 48 for a table that shows average balances and cost of funds for our funding sources. Net interest income was $12,450,000 and the net interest margin was 2.07% in 2016, down $20,781,000 or 63% from $33,231,000 a year ago, which represented a net interest margin of 6.03%, all reflecting the items discussed above. 52 Table of Contents Noninterest income, which is comprised of management fees, prepayment fees, servicing fee income, late charges, and other miscellaneous income was $408,000 in 2016, up $89,000 or 28% from $319,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting higher servicing and other fees generated from the subsidiaries of Medallion Financial Corp. Operating expenses were $22,786,000 in 2016, up $6,062,000 or 36% from $16,724,000 in 2015, and which included a $5,099,000 goodwill impairment writeoff in 2016. Excluding the goodwill writedown, operating expenses increased 6%. Salaries and benefits expense was $11,770,000 in the year, up $126,000 or 1% from $11,644,000 in 2015, reflecting higher executive bonuses and executive salary expenses in the current year, partially offset by lower salaries related to the exiting of the asset-based lending business in late 2016. Professional fees were $2,347,000 in 2016, up $861,000 or 58% from $1,486,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting higher legal expenses for a variety of corporate and investment-related matters. Occupancy expense was $966,000 in 2016, up $89,000 or 10% from $877,000 in 2015. Other operating expenses of $2,604,000 in 2016 were down $113,000 or 4% from $2,717,000 a year ago, primarily reflecting lower advertising expense. Total income tax expense was $45,900,000 in 2016 compared to $0 in 2015, and was comprised of three components, a $10,047,000 benefit related net investment loss, and provisions of $384,000 and $55,563,000 related to realized and unrealized gains on investments. These provisions included amounts relevant to prior years' unrealized gains and losses, and were recorded in 2016 as a result of our failure to qualify for RIC tax treatment. See note 5 for more information. Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments before taxes was $78,886,000 in 2016, compared to $4,914,000 in 2015, an increase in appreciation of $73,972,000. Net change in unrealized appreciation other than the portion related to Medallion Bank and the other controlled subsidiaries, was depreciation of $51,235,000 in 2016 compared to $11,916,000 in 2015, resulting in increased depreciation of $39,319,000 in 2016. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) arises when we make valuation adjustments to the investment portfolio. When investments are sold or written off, any resulting realized gain (loss) is grossed up to reflect previously recorded unrealized components. As a result, movement between periods can appear distorted. The 2016 activity resulted from net appreciation on Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries of $130,121,000 and by reversals of unrealized depreciation associated with fully depreciated loans which were charged off of $3,486,000, partially offset by unrealized depreciation on loans of $27,710,000, investments other than securities of $28,372,000, and net unrealized appreciation on investment securities of $1,367,000. The 2015 activity resulted from net appreciation on Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries of $16,830,000 reversals of unrealized depreciation associated with fully depreciated loans which were charged off of $1,015,000, net reversals of unrealized depreciation associated with equity investments which were sold of $292,000 and net unrealized appreciation on other investments of $209,000, partially offset by net depreciation on investments other than securities of $9,621,000, net unrealized depreciation on loans of $3,743,000, net depreciation on other assets of $68,000. The net appreciation on Medallion Bank and other controlled subsidiaries described above is net of the dividends declared by them to us of $3,000,000 in 2016 and $18,889,000 in 2015. Our net realized gains on investments before taxes were $457,000 in 2016, compared to gains of $7,636,000 in 2015, a decrease in realized gains of $7,179,000 in 2016. The 2016 activity reflected the reversals described in the unrealized paragraph above, and other net loan chargeoffs of $224,000, partially offset by gains of $2,111,000 from the sale of investment securities and $2,057,000 from the sale of the asset-based lending portfolio. The 2015 activity reflected the reversals described in the unrealized paragraph above, and reversals of $4,809,000 of unrealized appreciation related to sales of other controlled subsidiaries, $3,296,000 of other gains from the other controlled subsidiaries sales, and other gains on equity investments of $913,000, partially offset by net direct chargeoffs of loans and equity investments of $75,000. Our net realized/unrealized gains on investments were $23,396,000 in 2016, compared to $12,550,000 in 2015, an increase of $10,846,000 or 86% of net gains in the year, reflecting the above. ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT Interest Rate Sensitivity We, like other financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest-earning assets (consisting of medallion, commercial, and consumer loans; and investment securities) reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of credit facilities with banks and other lenders, bank certificates of deposit, and SBA debentures). Having interest-bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates, although such an asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates. Abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates. Conversely, having interest-earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates, although this asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates. This mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk. 53 Table of Contents The effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio. Based on past experience, we anticipate that approximately 40% of the taxicab medallion portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year. We believe that the average life of our loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates. Borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower's loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates. Conversely, borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment. However, borrowers may prepay for a variety of other reasons, such as to monetize increases in the underlying collateral values, particularly in the medallion loan portfolio. In addition, we manage our exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed-rate indebtedness, such as ten year subordinated SBA debentures, and by setting repricing intervals on certificates of deposit, for terms of up to five years. We had outstanding SBA debentures of $79,564,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.39%, constituting 24% of our total indebtedness, and retail notes of $33,625,000, with a weighted average interest rate of 9.00%, constituting 10% of total indebtedness as of December 31, 2017. Also, as of December 31, 2017, certain of the certificates of deposit were for terms of up to 57 months, further mitigating the immediate impact of changes in market interest rates. A relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from our interest rate sensitivity gap. The interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which mature and/or reprice within specified intervals of time. The gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities, and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets. A relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets. The following table presents our interest rate sensitivity gap at December 31, 2017, compared to the respective positions at the end of 2016 and 2015. The principal amounts of interest earning assets are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be repriced. We have not reflected an assumed annual prepayment rate for such assets in this table.

(2) Adjusted for the medallion loan 40% prepayment assumption results in a cumulative one year positive interest rate gap and related ratio of $5,303 or 2% at December 31, 2017, compared to a positive interest rate gap of $36,392 or 9% and a negative interest rate gap of ($43,838) or (9%) for December 31, 2016 and 2015, and was ($125,265) or (9%), ($86,349) or (6%), and ($77,488) or (5%) on a combined basis with Medallion Bank. 54 Table of Contents Our interest rate sensitive assets were $331,918,000 and interest rate sensitive liabilities were $327,623,000 at December 31, 2017. The one-year cumulative interest rate gap was a negative $14,088,000 or 4% of interest rate sensitive assets, compared to a negative $4,542,000 or 1% at December 31, 2016 and $114,848,000 or 24% at December 31, 2015. However, using our estimated 40% prepayment/refinancing rate for medallion loans to adjust the interest rate gap resulted in a positive gap of $5,303,000 or 2% at December 31, 2017. We seek to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable-rate loans, by incurring fixed-rate indebtedness, by evaluating appropriate derivatives, pursuing securitization opportunities, and by other options consistent with managing interest rate risk. On a combined basis with Medallion Bank, our interest rate sensitive assets were $1,402,872,000 and interest rate sensitive liabilities were $1,234,371,000 at December 31, 2017. The one-year cumulative interest rate gap was a negative $172,208,000 or 12% of interest rate sensitive assets, compared to a negative $160,931,000 or 11% and $220,686,000 or 14% at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Using our estimated 40% prepayment/refinancing rate for medallion loans to adjust the interest rate gap resulted in a negative gap of $125,265,000 or 9% at December 31, 2017. Interest Rate Cap Agreements We manage our exposure to increases in market rates of interest by periodically purchasing interest rate caps to lock in the cost of funds of our variable-rate debt in the event of a rapid run up in interest rates. We entered into contracts to purchase interest rate caps on $70,000,000 of notional value of principal from various multinational banks, with termination dates ranging to December 2018. The caps provide for payments to us if various LIBOR thresholds are exceeded during the cap terms. Total cap purchases were generally fully expensed when paid, including $19,000, $20,000, and $81,000 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, and all are carried at $0 on the balance sheet at December 31, 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our sources of liquidity are with a variety of local and regional banking institutions, unfunded commitments to sell debentures to the SBA, loan amortization and prepayments, private issuances of debt securities, participations or sales of loans to third parties, the disposition of other assets of the Company, and dividends from Medallion Bank and Medallion Capital. As a RIC, we were required to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income; consequently, we primarily relied upon external sources of funds to finance growth. However, as of December 31, 2016 and subsequent quarters, we did not qualify for the RIC election, and therefore became subject to taxation as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Code. Additionally, there were $5,500,000 of unfunded commitments from the SBA. Additionally, Medallion Bank, our wholly-owned, unconsolidated portfolio company has access to independent sources of funds for our business originated there, primarily through brokered certificates of deposit. Medallion Bank has $25,000,000 available under Fed Funds lines with several commercial banks. In addition, Medallion Bank is allowed to retain all earnings in the business to fund future growth. The components of our debt were as follows at December 31, 2017. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements on page F-19 for details of the contractual terms of our borrowings.

We have been in active and ongoing discussions with each of these lenders and have extended each of the facilities as they matured except as set forth in the following paragraph. The lenders have worked with us to extend and change the terms of the borrowing agreements. We have arranged for changes to the terms of the notes and payment and borrowing base calculations which we anticipate will facilitate our operations for the foreseeable future. We and our subsidiaries obtain financing under lending facilities extended by various banks and other financial institutions, some of which are secured by loans, taxi medallions and other assets. Where these facilities are extended to our subsidiaries, we and others of our subsidiaries may guarantee the obligations of the relevant borrower. Five of our smallest subsidiaries are borrowers under promissory notes extended to them by a bank that total $8.8 million that came due on October 17, 2016. These loans are secured by Chicago taxi medallions owned by our subsidiaries. These notes are guaranteed by Medallion Funding, not by Medallion Financial Corp. These subsidiaries have not repaid the amounts due under the notes and the bank has filed a suit seeking payment of these amounts. This failure to pay would constitute an event of default under certain loan agreements under which we or our subsidiaries are borrowers, but the lenders under those agreements have waived the default. If judgment is entered against us in the suit brought by the bank or entered and not satisfied within specified periods of time, these outcomes may constitute an additional event of default under these other agreements. If waivers are required and not granted for this additional event of default, it would lead to events of default under other of our financing arrangements. We value our portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors in accordance with our valuation policy. Unlike certain lending institutions, we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses. Instead, we must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis. We record unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when we believe that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely. We record unrealized appreciation on equities if we have a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, our equity investment has also appreciated in value. Without a readily ascertainable market value, the estimated value of our portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments. We adjust the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect our Board of Directors' estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio. Any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Our investment in Medallion Bank, as a wholly-owned portfolio investment, is also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value. We conduct a thorough valuation analysis, and also receive an opinion regarding the valuation from an independent third party to assist the Board of Directors in its determination of the fair value of Medallion Bank. We determine whether any factors give rise to valuation different than recorded book value. As a result of this valuation process, we had previously used Medallion Bank's actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value, and recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. In the 2015 second quarter, we first became aware of external interest in Medallion Bank and its portfolio assets at values in excess of their book value. Expression of interest in Medallion Bank from both investment bankers and interested parties has continued through 2016 and 2017.We incorporated these new factors in the Medallion Bank's fair value analysis and the Board of Directors determined that Medallion Bank had a fair value in excess of book value. In addition, in the 2016 third quarter there was a court ruling involving a marketplace lender that we believe heightens the interest of marketplace lenders to acquire or merge with Utah industrial banks. We also engaged a valuation specialist to assist the Board of Directors in its determination of Medallion Bank's fair value, and this appreciation of $15,500,000 was thereby recorded in 2015, and additional 56 Table of Contents appreciation of $128,918,000 and $7,849,000 was recorded in 2016 and 2017. See Note 3 for additional information about Medallion Bank. For more information, see ""Risk Factors  -  Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure  -  Our investment portfolio is, and will continue to be, recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors and, as a result, there is, and will continue to be, uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments which could adversely affect our net asset value."" In addition, the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In addition, if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we borrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains. We use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with short-term floating-rate debt, and to a lesser extent by term fixed-rate debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, and including the impact on Medallion Bank, a hypothetical immediate 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to the line item ""net increase in net assets resulting from operations"" as of December 31, 2017 by $1,778,000 on an annualized basis, compared to a positive impact of $1,100,000 at December 31, 2016, and the impact of such an immediate increase of 1% over a one year period would have been ($984,000) at December 31, 2017, compared to ($792,000) at December 31, 2016. Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet, and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates. We continue to work with investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include, among others, the sale or spinoff of certain assets or divisions, the development of a securitization conduit program, and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes. These financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth. 57 Table of Contents The following table illustrates sources of available funds for us and each of our subsidiaries, and amounts outstanding under credit facilities and their respective end of period weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2017.

Loan amortization, prepayments, and sales also provide a source of funding for us. Prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates, medallion loan market values, economic conditions, and competition. We also generate liquidity through deposits generated at Medallion Bank, borrowing arrangements with other banks, and through the issuance of SBA debentures, as well as from cash flow from operations. In addition, we may choose to participate a greater portion of our loan portfolio to third parties. We are actively seeking additional sources of liquidity, however, given current market conditions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional liquidity on terms favorable to us or at all. If that occurs, we may decline to underwrite lower yielding loans in order to conserve capital until credit conditions in the market become more favorable; or we may be required to dispose of assets when we would not otherwise do so, and at prices which may be below the net book value of such assets in order for us to repay indebtedness on a timely basis. Also, Medallion Bank is not a RIC, and therefore is able to retain earnings to finance growth. 58 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-09, Compensation  -  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. The objective of this update is to provide clarity and reduce both diversity in practice and cost and complexity when applying the guidance of Topic 718. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We have assessed the impact of the update and have determined that it will not have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles  -  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The objective of this update is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not believe this update will have a material impact on our financial condition. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, ""Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."" The update clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice related to eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We have assessed the impact of the update and have determined that it will not have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)"". ASU 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for leases classified as operating under current GAAP. ASU 2016-02 applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 for public entities, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the impact the update will have on our financial condition and results of operations. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, ""Financial Instruments  -  Overall (Topic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."" The main objective of this Update is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments and provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments to be measured at fair value, simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investment without readily determinable fair value, eliminates the requirements to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost, and requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments. The update, as amended, is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We have assessed the impact of the update and have determined that it will not have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.","ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our business activities contain elements of risk. We consider the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio valuations. We consider the management of risk essential to conducting our businesses. Accordingly, our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risks, to set appropriate policies and limits, and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs. We value our portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors in accordance with our valuation policy. Unlike certain lending institutions, we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses. Instead, we must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis. We record unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when we believe that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely. We record unrealized appreciation on equities if we have a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, our equity investment has also appreciated in value. Without a readily ascertainable market value, the estimated value of our portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments. We adjust the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect our Board of Directors' estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio. Any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Our investment in Medallion Bank, as a wholly-owned portfolio investment, is also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value. We conduct a thorough valuation analysis, and also receive an opinion regarding the valuation from an independent third party to assist the Board of Directors in its determination of the fair value of Medallion Bank. We determine whether any factors give rise to valuation different than recorded book value. As a result of this valuation process, we had previously used Medallion Bank's actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value, and recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. In the 2015 second quarter, we first became aware of external interest in Medallion Bank and its portfolio assets at values in excess of their book value. Expression of interest in Medallion Bank from both investment bankers 59 Table of Contents and interested parties has continued through 2016 and 2017. We incorporated these new factors in the Medallion Bank's fair value analysis and the Board of Directors determined that Medallion Bank had a fair value in excess of book value. In addition, in the 2016 third quarter there was a court ruling involving a marketplace lender that the Company believes heightens the interest of marketplace lenders to acquire or merge with Utah industrial banks. We also engaged a valuation specialist to assist the Board of Directors in their determination of Medallion Bank's fair value, and this appreciation of $15,500,000 was thereby recorded in 2015, and additional appreciation of $128,918,000 was recorded in 2016 and $7,849,000 was recorded in 2017. For more information, see ""Risk Factors  -  Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure  -  Our investment portfolio is, and will continue to be, recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors and, as a result, there is, and will continue to be, uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments which could adversely affect our net asset value."" In addition, the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In addition, if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we borrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains. We use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with short-term floating-rate debt, and to a lesser extent by term fixed-rate debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, and including the impact on Medallion Bank, a hypothetical immediate 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to the line item ""net increase in net assets resulting from operations"" as of December 31, 2017 by $1,778,000 on an annualized basis, compared to a positive impact of $1,100,000 at December 31, 2016, and the impact of such an immediate increase of 1% over a one year period would have been ($984,000) at December 31, 2017, compared to ($792,000) at December 31, 2016. Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet, and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates.","ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Reference is made to the financial statements set forth under Item 15 (A) (1) in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which financial statements are incorporated herein by reference in response to this Item 8.","ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report. As a result of this evaluation, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the 2017 fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, and have concluded that there have been no changes that occurred during the 2017 fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 60 Table of Contents Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: <U+0095>   Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; <U+0095>   Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and <U+0095>   Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment and those criteria, management believes that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. We believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly represent our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for all periods presented. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Mazars USA LLP, has audited and issued a report on management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of Mazars USA LLP appears below. 61 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Medallion Financial Corp. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Medallion Financial Corp. and subsidiaries' (the ""Company"") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO""). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB""), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company including the consolidated summary schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and schedules listed in the index to the financial statements and in Item 15(A)3 as Exhibit 99.1, and the selected financial ratios and other data for each of the five years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2017 of the Company, and our report dated March 14, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Mazars USA LLP New York, New York March 14, 2018 62 Table of Contents","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000209/0001193125-18-082402-index.html"
"HENRY SCHEIN INC","10-K","2018","1","ITEM 1.  Business General We believe we are the world's largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners.  We serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories, animal health clinics and physician practices, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.  We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 85 years of experience distributing health care products. We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 22,000 people (of which more than 11,400 are based outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 34 countries, including the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. We offer a comprehensive selection of products and services and value-added solutions for operating efficient practices and delivering high quality care.  We operate through a centralized and automated distribution network with a selection of more than 120,000 branded products and Henry Schein private brand products in stock, as well as more than 180,000 additional products available as special order items.  We also offer our customers exclusive, innovative technology solutions, including practice management software and e-commerce solutions, as well as a broad range of financial services. We have established over 4.5 million square feet of space in 63 strategically located distribution centers around the world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers' needs.  Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment. We conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, animal health and medical operating segments.  This segment distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.  Our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  Our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics.  Our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions. Our technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  Our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics.  Our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners. 3 Table of Contents Industry The health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and diverse.  This industry, which encompasses the dental, animal health and medical markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $45 billion in 2017 in the global markets.  The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices. Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier. The health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage.  In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians' offices. We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base. In recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management. Competition The distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive.  Many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers.  In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products.  Manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors. In North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers, of dental, animal health and medical products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, customer service and value-added products and services.  In the dental market, our primary competitors are the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company.  In addition, we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional and local level.  In the animal health market, our primary competitors are the MWI Animal Health division of AmerisourceBergen and the Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc.  Our primary competitors in the medical market are McKesson Corporation and Medline Industries, Inc., which are national distributors.  We also compete against a number of regional and local animal health and medical distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to veterinarians and physicians.  With regard to our dental practice management software, we compete against numerous companies, including Carestream Health, Inc. and the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc.  In the animal health practice management market, our primary competitors are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and the Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc.  The medical practice management and electronic medical records 4 Table of Contents market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the NextGen division of Quality Systems, Inc., eClinicalWorks and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Pluradent AG & Co., Lifco AB, Planmeca Oy, Billericay Dental Supply Co. Ltd., National Veterinary Services Limited (Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc.), Centaur Services Limited (MWI Animal Health division of AmerisourceBergen) and Alcyon SA, as well as a large number of dental, animal health and medical product distributors and manufacturers in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices.  Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results.

Our over 2,000 technicians provide installation and repair services for: dental handpieces; dental, animal health and medical small equipment; table top sterilizers; and large dental equipment.        Financial services.  We offer our customers solutions in operating their practices more efficiently by providing access to a number of financial services and products (including non-recourse financing for equipment, technology and software products; non-recourse patient financing; collection services and credit card processing) at rates that we believe are generally lower than what our customers would be able to secure independently. We also provide consulting services, dental practice valuation and brokerage services. Commitment to superior customer service.  We maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer service.  We frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical reports.  Our customer service policy primarily focuses on:                 Exceptional order fulfillment.  We ship an average of approximately 190,000 cartons daily.  Approximately 99% of items ordered are shipped without back ordering and are shipped on the same business day the order is received.        Streamlined ordering process.  Customers may place orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by mail, fax, telephone, e-mail, Internet and by using our computerized order entry systems. Integrated management information systems.  Our information systems generally allow for centralized management of key functions, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing, sales and order fulfillment.  These systems allow us to manage our growth, deliver superior customer service, properly target customers, manage financial performance and monitor daily operational statistics. Cost-effective purchasing.  We believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a competitive-pricing provider of health care products.  We continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers' offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest possible cost.  In 2017, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 34% and 5%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases. Efficient distribution.  We distribute our products from our strategically located distribution centers.  We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment.  These inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our management information systems.  Once an order is entered, it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer's location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order fulfillment. 6 Table of Contents Products The following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales by principal categories of products offered through our health care distribution and technology reportable segments: 2017       2016       2015   Health care distribution:                                           Dental products (1) ............................................................................................................................................................         48.5   %       48.0   %       49.6   %       Animal health products (2) ..................................................................................................................................................         27.9           28.1           27.5           Medical products (3) ..........................................................................................................................................................         20.1           20.2           19.5                                                               Total health care distribution ..............................................................................................................................................         96.5           96.3           96.6                                                           Technology:                                               Software and related products and                                                   other value-added products (4) .................................................................................................................................         3.5           3.7           3.4                                                           Total .......................................................................................................................................................................................         100.0   %       100.0   %       100.0   %                                                                                                           (1)   Includes infection-control products, handpieces, preventatives, impression materials, composites, anesthetics, teeth, dental implants,       gypsum, acrylics, articulators, abrasives, dental chairs, delivery units and lights, X-ray supplies and equipment, equipment        repair and high-tech and digital restoration equipment.

(3)   Includes branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products, X-ray        products, equipment and vitamins.                                                       (4)   Consists of practice management software and other value-added products, which are distributed primarily to health care providers,       and financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, continuing education services for practitioners, consulting and other        services. Business Strategy Our objective is to continue to expand as a global value-added provider of health care products and services to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners.  To accomplish this, we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:        Increase penetration of our existing customer base.  We have over 1 million customers worldwide and we intend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position as their primary supplier.        Increase the number of customers we serve.  This strategy includes increasing the number and productivity of field sales consultants, as well as using our customer database to focus our marketing efforts in all of our operating segments.  In the dental business, we provide products and services to traditional dental practices as well as new emerging segments, such as dental service organizations and community health centers.  Leveraging our unique assets and capabilities, we offer solutions to address these new markets.  In the medical business, we have expanded to serve customers located in settings outside of the traditional office, such as urgent care clinics, retail and occupational health settings.  As settings of health care shift, we remain committed to serving these practitioners and providing them with the products and services they need. 7 Table of Contents        Leverage our value-added products and services.  We continue to increase cross-selling efforts for key product lines utilizing a consultative selling process.  In the dental business, we have significant cross-selling opportunities between our dental practice management software users and our dental distribution customers.  In the animal health business, we have opportunities to cross-sell practice management software and other products.  In the medical business, we have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals sales to health care practitioners, as well as cross-selling core products and electronic health record and practice management software.  Our strategy extends to providing health systems, integrated delivery networks and other large group and multi-site health care organizations, that include physician clinics, these same value added products and services.  As physicians and health systems closely align, we have increased access to opportunities for cross-marketing and selling our product and service portfolios.        Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.  Our acquisition strategy includes acquiring businesses and entering into joint ventures complementary to ours that will provide, among other things, additional sales to be channeled through our existing distribution infrastructure, access to additional product lines and field sales consultants and an opportunity to further expand into new geographic markets. Markets Served Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is increasingly using health care services.  Between 2017 and 2027, the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12%.  Between 2017 and 2037, this age group is expected to grow by approximately 24%.  This compares with expected total U.S. population growth rates of approximately 8% between 2017 and 2027 and approximately 15% between 2017 and 2037. In the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases.  There is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates.  At the same time, there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage. We support our dental professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner's efficiency. The animal health market, impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care, as well as increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production, continues to provide additional growth opportunities for us.  We support the animal health practitioners we serve through the distribution of biologicals, pharmaceuticals, supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development, sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software. In the medical market, there continues to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians' offices, a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us.  There also is the continuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care settings.  We believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician practitioner. Additionally, we are expanding our dental full-service model, our animal health presence and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist.  Through our ""Schein Direct"" program, we also have the capability to provide door-to-door air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world. For information on revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 15 of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,"" which is incorporated herein by reference. 8 Table of Contents Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:        timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;        timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;        timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;        timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;        changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;        supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;        changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;        costs of developing new applications and services;        our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;        uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;        unexpected regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;        exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers;        loss of sales representatives;        costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;        costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;        general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;        our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;        unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;        product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;        exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;        increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;        fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies; 9 Table of Contents        restructuring costs;        the adoption or repeal of legislation;        changes in accounting principles; and                              litigation or regulatory judgements, expenses or settlements. Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate.  If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline. Governmental Regulations Operating, Security and Licensure Standards Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Among the United States federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (""FDC Act""), and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.  We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations. The FDC Act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state.  Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the United States Food and Drug Administration's (""FDA"") regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as ""HCT/P products."" The Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and pre-empts state law.  Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (""DSCSA""), is being phased in over ten years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.  The law's track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, subject to certain enforcement delays by the FDA, and will continue to be implemented.  The DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the DSCSA requirements. The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers (""3PLs""), and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities.  The DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs.  The DSCSA requires wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports to the FDA, which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name and address of each facility and contact information.  According to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area.  Current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the FDA issues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA. We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable DSCSA requirements. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification (""UDI"") system.  The FDA is phasing in the implementation of the UDI regulations over seven years, generally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices.  The UDI regulations require ""labelers"" to include unique device identifiers (""UDIs""), with 10 Table of Contents a content and format prescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited issuing agency, on the labels and packages of medical devices, and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs.  The UDI regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA, much of which information is publicly available on an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database.  The UDI regulations provide for certain exceptions, alternatives and time extensions.  For example, the UDI regulations include a general exception for Class I devices exempt from the Quality System Regulation (other than record-keeping requirements and complaint files).  Regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers, repackagers, reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device's label to be applied or modified, with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label, and include certain of our businesses. We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable UDI requirements. Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (""DEA"") permitting us to handle controlled substances.  We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.  We are subject to inspection by the DEA. Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale.  These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment.  In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example, human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue.  We are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products.  The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.  Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers.  Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell, which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm.  Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation. Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions. Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors. Antitrust The U.S. federal government, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive.  Violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties.  Private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages. Health Care Fraud Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws, referred to as 11 Table of Contents ""false claims laws,"" prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as ""anti-kickback laws,"" prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of ""relators,"" who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws.  Under the federal False Claims Act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  Also violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and, in accordance with a final rule published by the Department of Justice on February 3, 2017, which substantially increased the maximum and minimum civil penalties for False Claims Act violations, the amounts for civil penalties assessed after February 3, 2017, whose associated violations occurred after November 2, 2015, were increased from a minimum per-claim penalty of $10,781 to $10,957, and from a maximum per-claim penalty of $21,563 to $21,916.  Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties.  The United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010 (the ""Health Care Reform Law""), significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability. The United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance. We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years. Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Health Care Reform The Health Care Reform Law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage. The Health Care Reform Law requirements include a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics 12 Table of Contents that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales.  However, with respect to the medical device excise tax, a two year moratorium was imposed under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017, and on January 22, 2018 an additional two-year moratorium was imposed under Public Law No. 115-120, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2019.  The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance.  The Health Care Reform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented.  In addition, the President is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law.  Repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate.  Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken the Health Care Reform Law.  On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions.  The tax reform law also repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law.  The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan. A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  The Centers for Medicine and Medicaid Services (""CMS"") publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities. Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.  We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements, our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us. Another notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (""MACRA""), enacted on April 16, 2015, establishes a new payment framework, called the Quality Payment Program, which modifies certain Medicare payments to ""eligible clinicians,"" including physicians, dentists and other practitioners.  Under MACRA, eligible clinicians will be required to participate in Medicare through the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (""MIPS"") or Advanced Alternative Payment Models (""APMs"").  MIPS generally will consolidate three current programs; the physician quality reporting system, the value-based payment modifier and the Medicare electronic health record (""EHR"") programs into a single program in which Medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality, resource use, clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified EHR technology.  Advanced APMs generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk.  A final rule was published in the Federal Register on November 4, 2016 and allows eligible Medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began January 1, 2017.  The data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning January 1, 2019.  A final rule updating certain Quality Payment Program regulations was published on November 16, 2017, which became effective as of January 1, 2018.  MACRA represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations.  The implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace.  MACRA may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment, leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base.  Although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this. 13 Table of Contents Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products. In addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.  These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.  For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations (""HIPAA"").  HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted a new pan-European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), effective from May 25, 2018, which increases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extends the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in Europe (""Data Subjects"") or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe).  Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues.  Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data.  Among other things, the GDPR requires with respect to data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data.  While we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR requirements, our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards,  such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers' comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation. Federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The initiatives include providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives, if they meaningfully use certified EHR 14 Table of Contents technology in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements.  In addition, Medicare-eligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified EHR systems and meet ""meaningful use"" requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative Medicare reimbursement reductions, which reductions for applicable health professionals (including physicians and dentists) began on January 1, 2015.  Qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by CMS and by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (""ONC"") of the Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS""). The use of certified EHR technology will continue as a feature of MACRA's MIPS program, and in connection with this, Medicare EHR program payment adjustments to eligible clinicians will sunset at the end of 2018 and MIPS payment adjustments will begin on January 1, 2019.  The first performance period for MIPS began January 1, 2017, and will afford eligible clinicians different reporting options linked to the amount of data reported and the duration of the reporting period, with positive payment adjustments generally linked to more robust reporting. On October 6, 2015, CMS and ONC released comprehensive final rules with respect to the EHR program that, among other things, established the more challenging ""Stage 3"" criteria, made certain adjustments to Stage 1 and Stage 2 standards (e.g., reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days), and finalized 2015 edition health information technology (HIT) certification criteria (which is now added to the existing 2014 edition HIT certification criteria, but not required until 2018).  Notably, under the new rules, compliance with Stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017, and would generally be required for all eligible providers (regardless of prior participation in the EHR incentive program) for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently.  Developers and others involved in the manufacture of EHR program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 EHR program period.  In connection with the release of the October 6 rules, HHS has also stated that it will continue to modify applicable EHR program standards.  On November 14, 2016, CMS published a final rule that will impact Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs through revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals, critical access hospitals and dual-eligible hospitals. Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and therefore we must maintain compliance with, and are affected by, these changing governmental criteria.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria.  Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs.  CMS and ONC establish criteria for certified EHR systems, and these criteria have been subject to change.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria. If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, as noted above, we are exposed to risk under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the False Claims Act.  For example, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155 million settlement and 5-year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based on allegations that the vendor, by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use payments in violation of the False Claims Act.  While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality.  Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers.  Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements.  Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission 15 Table of Contents standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties, and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Additionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important.  On September 6, 2017, the FDA issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information.  As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device. There may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care. E-Commerce Electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships.  Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition.  The continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings. Through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives.  We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business.  We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets. International Transactions In addition, United States and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products.  We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the United States. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business, there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers' practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business.  As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes.  We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. See ""ITEM 1A. Risk Factors"" for a discussion of additional burdens, risks and regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Risk Factors The risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock.  Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations.  You should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.  The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority. The health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating, and we may not be able to compete successfully. We compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.  Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully.  Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors.  Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market.  Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and the roles of other distributors.  Industry consolidation among health care product distributors, price competition, the unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition.  There has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability.  Additionally, in this competitive market, some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments.  We could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments.  In the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability. Because substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products. We obtain substantially all of our products from third parties.  Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us.  Therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request.  While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, some key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell.  Additionally, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements.  The failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions.  In the event that any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in our required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis.  There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all.  An extended interruption in the supply of our products, especially any high sales volume product, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute. Our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers.  If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected. 21 Table of Contents Our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman.  We do not currently have ""key man"" life insurance policies on any of our employees.  Competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel. We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:        timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;        timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;        timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;        timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;        changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;        supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;        changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;        costs of developing new applications and services;        our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;        uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;        unexpected regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;        exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers, which may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers;        loss of sales representatives;        costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;        costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;        general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;        our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;        unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;        product demand and availability, or product recalls by manufacturers; 22 Table of Contents        exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;        increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;        fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;        restructuring costs;        the adoption or repeal of legislation;        changes in accounting principles; and                      litigation or regulatory judgments, expenses or settlements. Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate.  If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline. Expansion of group purchasing organizations (""GPO"") or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage. The medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs, demand more favorable pricing terms. Additionally, the formation of provider networks and GPOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship. This may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results. Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to obtain access to lower prices demanded by GPO contracts or other contracts, and to develop relationships with provider networks and new GPOs, we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed. Increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business. Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business.  We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment.  Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.  Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, include, among other things:        the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union (generally referred to as Brexit) and any other similar referenda or actions by other European Union member countries (during 2017, approximately 7% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in the United Kingdom and approximately 25% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in Europe overall, including the U.K.);        election results;        changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade (including, without limitation, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other international trade agreements);        greater restrictions on imports and exports;          changes in laws and policies governing health care;          tariffs and sanctions; 23 Table of Contents        sovereign debt levels;        the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic, currency or budgetary crises or issues;        consumer confidence;        unemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population);        changes in regulatory and tax regulations; including without limitation, the Tax Cuts and Reform Act;        increases in interest rates;        availability of capital;        increases in fuel and energy costs;        the effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase prices over time;                      changes in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions;        increases in health care costs;          the threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest; and        changes in laws and policies governing manufacturing, development and investment in territories and countries where we do business. Additionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall. Recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale.  We generally sell products to customers with payment terms.  If customers' cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us.  Likewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms.  Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products and/or services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us. Our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.  Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us. The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.  A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including, but not limited to:        the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community; 24 Table of Contents        changes in our industry and competitors;        changes in government or legislation;        our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;        stock repurchases;        any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, issuances of restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;        general market and economic conditions; and        any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on NASDAQ.  Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.  In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies.  This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business. The health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences.  In recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other things: trends toward managed care; consolidation of health care distribution companies; consolidation of health care manufacturers; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers, as well as growing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental officials.  Both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services, changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined and, in the case of animal health practitioners, changes in the use of feed additives (including, without limitation, antibiotics and growth promotants) used in the production of animal products due to trade restrictions, animal welfare and/or government regulations; and changes in customer buying habits (including customers purchasing animal health pharmaceuticals outside the veterinarians' offices).  If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. The implementation of the Health Care Reform Law could materially adversely affect our business. The Health Care Reform Law significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers. The Health Care Reform Law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013, and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold.  However, with respect to the medical device excise tax, a two-year moratorium was imposed under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017, and on January 22, 2018 an additional two-year moratorium was imposed under Public Law No. 115-120, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2019.  The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance.  The Health Care 25 Table of Contents Reform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented.  In addition, the President is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law. Repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate.  Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken the Health Care Law.  On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions.  The tax reform law also repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law.  The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law also affects our ability to plan. Another notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (""MACRA""), establishes a new payment framework, called the Quality Payment Program, which modifies certain Medicare payments to ""eligible clinicians,"" including physicians, dentists and other practitioners.  Under MACRA, eligible clinicians will be required to participate in Medicare through MIPS or APMs.  MIPS generally will consolidate three current programs: the physician quality reporting system, the value-based payment modifier, and the Medicare EHR program into a single program in which Medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality, resource use, clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified EHR technology.  Advanced APMs generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk.  A final rule was published in the Federal Register on November 4, 2016 and allows eligible Medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began January 1, 2017.  The data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning January 1, 2019.  A final rule updating certain Quality Payment Program regulations was published on November 16, 2017, which is effective as of January 1, 2018.  MACRA represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations.  The implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace.  MACRA may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment, leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base.  Although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this. The implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business. A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or Open Payments Program, imposes reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.  Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.  We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these reporting requirements, our compliance with these new rules imposes additional costs on us. 26 Table of Contents Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business. Our business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products, and animal feed and supplements.  Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act.  Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:        regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting, record keeping, introduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products and medical devices;        subject us to inspection by the FDA and the DEA;        regulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;        require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable FDA requirements;        require registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;        require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;        require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA;        require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities; and        impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death. Applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment, and the importation and exportation of products.  Our business also is subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad.  The FDA and DEA have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities. The failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our business.  There can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business.  The costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they may be modified, could be material.  Allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.  While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution.  If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses.  Non-compliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation. 27 Table of Contents If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business. Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws, referred to as ""false claims laws,"" prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as ""anti-kickback laws,"" prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Health care fraud measures may implicate, for example, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices, and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billing-related functionality. The fraud and abuse regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity, over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of ""relators,"" who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws.  Under the federal False Claims Act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  Also, violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and, in accordance with a final rule published by the Department of Justice on February 3, 2017, which substantially increased the maximum and minimum civil penalties for False Claims Act violations, the amounts for civil penalties assessed after February 3, 2017, whose associated violations occurred after November 2, 2015, were increased from a minimum per-claim penalty of $10,781 to $10,957, and from a maximum per-claim penalty of $21,563 to $21,916.    Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties.  The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability. The United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance. We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the German Anti-Corruption Law and other anti-bribery laws, anti-corruption laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.  Our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results, including, without limitation, securities, antitrust and marketing laws and regulations.  Failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of non - compliance.  We may determine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters.  For example, one of our subsidiaries recently resolved an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software, which resulted in a consent order and fine.  Failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business. 28 Table of Contents While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities. The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products. Our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.  These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.  For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as HIPAA.  HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.  Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers.  Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements.  Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted the GDPR, effective from May 25, 2018, which increases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extends the scope or responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to Data Subjects or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe).  Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues.  Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data.  Among other things, the GDPR requires with respect to data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data.  While we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR requirements, our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 29 Table of Contents We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers' comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation. In addition, federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The initiatives include providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified EHR systems in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements.  In addition, Medicare-eligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified EHR systems and meet ""meaningful use"" requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative Medicare reimbursement reductions, which reductions for applicable health professionals (including physicians and dentists) began on January 1, 2015.  Qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by CMS and ONC.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria.  Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs.  CMS and ONC establish criteria for certified EHR systems and these criteria have been subject to change.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria.  If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, as noted above, we are exposed to risk under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the False Claims Act.  For example, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155 million settlement and 5-year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based on allegations that the vendor, by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use payments in violation of the False Claims Act.  While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality.  Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Moreover in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality.  Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business. On October 6, 2015, CMS and ONC released comprehensive final rules with respect to the EHR program that, among other things, established the more challenging ""Stage 3"" criteria, making certain adjustments to Stage 1 and Stage 2 standards (e.g., reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days), and finalized 2015 edition health technology (HIT) certification criteria (which is now added to the existing 2014 edition HIT certification criteria, but not required until 2018).  Notably, under the new rules, compliance with Stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017, and would generally be required for all eligible providers (regardless of prior participation in the EHR incentive program) for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently.  Developers and others involved in the manufacture of EHR program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products, and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 EHR program period.  In connection with the release of the October 6 rules, HHS has also stated it will continue to modify applicable EHR program standards.  On November 14, 2016, CMS published a final rule that will impact Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs 30 Table of Contents through revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals, critical access hospitals, and dual-eligible hospitals. The use of certified EHR technology will continue as a feature of MACRA's MIPS programs, and in connection with this, Medicare EHR program payment adjustments to eligible professionals will sunset at the end of 2018 and MIPS payment adjustments will begin on January 1, 2019.  The first performance period for MIPS began January 1, 2017, and will afford eligible clinicians different reporting options linked to the amount of data reported and the duration of the reporting period, with positive payment adjustments generally linked to more robust reporting.  Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and therefore we must maintain compliance with, and are affected by, these changing governmental criteria. Additionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important.  On September 6, 2017, the FDA issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information.  As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device. There may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care. Our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business. Global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business.  The risks that our global operations are subject to include, among other things:        difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;        difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;        fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;        longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;        repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;        regulatory requirements;        anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records;        unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;        imposition of import/export tariffs, quotas, sanctions or penalties;        difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing in foreign markets;        limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;        unexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;        changes in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;        civil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups; and        public health emergencies. 31 Table of Contents Our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks. We have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future.  Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock.  Some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:        may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;        requires significant management attention;        may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources; and        results in additional acquisition and integration expenses. There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful.  Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following:        the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;        our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to U.S. or foreign antitrust regulations;        the availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions;        the liquidity of our investments and our ability to raise capital could be affected by the financial credit markets; and        our ability to retain, recruit and incentivize the management of the companies we acquire. Our acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect. We are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations, services, products and personnel of each company within our management policies, procedures and strategies.  We cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions.  To effectively manage our expected future growth, we must continue to manage successfully our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, working capital management and financial and operational controls.  If we fail in any of these areas, our business could be materially adversely affected. We face inherent risk of exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury. Our business involves a risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products.  Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products.  As a result, we are subject to the potential risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities.  Additionally, as our private-label business continues to grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims.  Another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain.  In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials.  The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability.  In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful. We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  In many cases in which we have been sued in 32 Table of Contents connection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection.  A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation. Our technology segment depends upon continued software and e-services product development, technical support and successful marketing. Competition among companies supplying practice management software and/or e-services is intense and increasing.  Our future sales of practice management software and e-services will depend on, among other factors:        the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;        our ability to enhance our products and services to satisfy customer requirements; and        our ability to provide ongoing technical support. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software, software enhancements or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services will be released on time or accepted by the market.  Our software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released.  We cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software errors or bugs will not occur.  Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation.  We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections.  We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or e-services products. We rely on third parties for certain technologically advanced products. Some of our products contain technologically advanced components, including software, that are developed by third parties.  We may not be able to replace the functions provided by these third-party components or products if they become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions, or if they are not adequately maintained or updated. In addition, third-party suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our customers.  Alternate sources for the technology currently provided by third parties to us may not be available to us in a timely manner, and may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use or sell. Further, the risk of intellectual property infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our business to include more technologically advanced products and continue to incorporate third party components, software and/or other intellectual property into the products we sell.  Also, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology.  Any infringement action brought against us or our customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us. The risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results and our reputation. 33 Table of Contents We may experience competition from third-party online commerce sites. Traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions.  The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis.  The emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business. Security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time. We rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store data to, among other things:        maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;        receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;        manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;        process payments to suppliers; and        provide products and services that maintain certain of our customers' electronic medical or dental records (including protected health information of their patients). Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our IS security systems causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.   In particular, certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws and regulations, such as HIPAA, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers' comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses. Regarding direct customer claims, although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges, or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases. In addition, our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems, and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to an IS security breach.  Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services. 34 Table of Contents Risks associated with these and other IS security breaches may include, among other things:        future results could be materially adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;        operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities;        procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new IS challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us;        we may incur claims, fines and penalties, and costs for remediation, or substantial defense and settlement expenses; and        negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers. We also deliver Internet-based services and, accordingly, depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the Internet.  In the event of any difficulties, outages and delays by Internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing such services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation. We have various insurance policies, including cyber liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.  There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.  Successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation. Certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares. The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  These provisions, among other things:        require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and        require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (i) remove a director; and (ii) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions. In addition, our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control.  These incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter, and certain other awards made under these incentive plans (such as restricted stock/unit awards) accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control.  Further, certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason, in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control. 35 Table of Contents Tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities. We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions.  From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives.  On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions.  We are still analyzing the complex new law to determine its impact.  In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.  Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.","ITEM 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements In accordance with the ""Safe Harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we provide the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein.

Where You Can Find Important Information We may disclose important information through one or more of the following channels: SEC filings, public conference calls and webcasts, press releases, the investor relations page of our website (www.henryschein.com) and the social media channels identified on the Newsroom page of our website. Executive-Level Overview We believe we are the world's largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners.  We serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories, animal health clinics and physician practices, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.  We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 85 years of experience distributing health care products. 45 Table of Contents We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 22,000 people (of which more than 11,400 are based outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 34 countries, including the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers' needs.  Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment. We conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, animal health and medical operating segments.  This segment distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.  Our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  Our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics.  Our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions. Our global technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  Our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics.  Our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners. Industry Overview In recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management. Our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the health care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements. Our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty, particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services. 46 Table of Contents Industry Consolidation The health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and diverse.  This industry, which encompasses the dental, animal health and medical markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $45 billion in 2017 in the global markets.  The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices. Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier. The trend of consolidation extends to our customer base.  Health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician hospital organizations.  In many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners' offices. We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base. Our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  This trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses. As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this.  We also have invested in expanding our sales/marketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the office-based practitioner setting. As the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued.  If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful. Aging Population and Other Market Influences The health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage.  In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians' offices. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's International Data Base, in 2017 there were more than six million Americans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care and elder-care 47 Table of Contents services.  By the year 2050, that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 19 million.  The population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 50% during the same time period. As a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the United States.  We believe that demand for our products and services will grow, while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating, economic and industry conditions.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS,  published ""National Health Expenditure Projections 2016-2025"" indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately $3.4 trillion in 2016, or 18.1% of the nation's gross domestic product, the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the United States.  Health care spending is projected to reach approximately $5.5 trillion in 2025, approximately 19.9% of the nation's gross domestic product. Government Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care, and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and/or medical treatments or services.  Also, many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance.  In addition, our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance, including securities, antitrust, anti-bribery and anti-kickback, customer interaction transparency, data privacy, data security and other laws and regulations.  Failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Health Care Reform The United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010 (the ""Health Care Reform Law"") increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage. The Health Care Reform Law requirements include a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales.  However, with respect to the medical device excise tax, a two-year moratorium was imposed under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017, and on January 22, 2018 an additional two-year moratorium was imposed under Public Law No. 115-120, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2019.  The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance.  The Health Care Reform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented.  In addition, the President is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law.  Repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate.  Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken the Health Care Reform Law.  On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions.  The tax reform law also repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law.  The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan. 48 Table of Contents A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities. Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.  We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements, our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us. Another notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (""MACRA""), enacted on April 16, 2015, establishes a new payment framework, called the Quality Payment Program, which modifies certain Medicare payments to ""eligible clinicians,"" including physicians, dentists and other practitioners.  Under MACRA, eligible clinicians will be required to participate in Medicare through the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (""MIPS"") or Advanced Alternative Payment Models (""APMs"").  MIPS generally will consolidate three current programs; the physician quality reporting system, the value-based payment modifier and the Medicare electronic health record (""EHR"") program, into a single program in which Medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians will include both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality, resource use, clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of certified EHR technology.  Advanced APMs generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk.  A final rule was published in the Federal Register on November 4, 2016 and allows eligible Medicare clinicians to pick their pace of participation for the first performance period that began January 1, 2017.  The data collected in the first performance year will determine payment adjustments beginning January 1, 2019.  A final rule updating certain Quality Payment Program regulations was published on November 16, 2017, which became effective as of January 1, 2018.  MACRA represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations.  The implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace.  MACRA may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment, leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base.  Although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this. Health Care Fraud Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws, referred to as ""false claims laws,"" prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as ""anti-kickback laws,"" prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. 49 Table of Contents The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of ""relators,"" who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws.  Under the federal False Claims Act, relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  Also, violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and, in accordance with a final rule published by the Department of Justice on February 3, 2017, which substantially increased the maximum and minimum civil penalties for False Claims Act violations, the amounts for civil penalties assessed after February 3, 2017, whose associated violations occurred after November 2, 2015, were increased from a minimum per-claim penalty of $10,781 to $10,957, and from a maximum per-claim penalty of $21,563 to $21,916.  Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties.  The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability. The United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance. We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years. Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Operating, Security and Licensure Standards Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Among the United States federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (""FDC Act""), and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.  We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations. The FDC Act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state.  Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the United States Food and Drug Administration's (""FDA"") regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as ""HCT/P products."" 50 Table of Contents The Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and pre-empts state law.  Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (""DSCSA""), is being phased in over a period of ten years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.  The law's track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, and will continue to be implemented.  The DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the DSCSA requirements. The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers (""3PLs""), and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities.  The DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs.  According to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area.  Current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the FDA issues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA. We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable DSCSA requirements. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 amended the FDCA to require the FDA to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification (""UDI"") system.  The FDA is phasing in the implementation of the UDI regulations over seven years, generally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices.  The UDI regulations require ""labelers"" to include unique device identifiers (""UDIs""), with a content and format prescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited issuing agency, on the labels and packages of medical devices, and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs.  The UDI regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA, much of which information is publicly available on an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database.   The UDI regulations provide for certain exceptions, alternatives and time extensions.  For example, the UDI regulations include a general exception for Class I devices exempt from the Quality System Regulation (other than record-keeping requirements and complaint files).  Regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers, repackagers, reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device's label to be applied or modified, with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label, and include certain of our businesses. We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable UDI requirements. Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (""DEA"") permitting us to handle controlled substances.  We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.  We are subject to inspection by the DEA. Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale.  These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment.  In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example, human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue.  We are also subject to 51 Table of Contents foreign government regulation of such products.  The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.  Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers.  Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell, which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm.  Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation. Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions. Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors. Antitrust The U.S. federal government, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive.  Violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties.  Private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages. Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products. In addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted a new pan-European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), effective from May 25, 2018, which increases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extends the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in Europe (""Data Subjects"") or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe).  Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues.  Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data.  Among other things, the GDPR requires with respect to data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data.  While we expect to have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR requirements, our compliance with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers' comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal or contractual requirements, may not only 52 Table of Contents cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation. Federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The initiatives include providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified EHR technology in accordance with applicable and evolving requirements.  In addition, Medicare-eligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified EHR systems and meet ""meaningful use"" requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative Medicare reimbursement reductions, which reductions for applicable health professionals (including physicians and dentists) began on January 1, 2015.  Qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by CMS and by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (""ONC"") of the Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS""). The use of certified EHR technology will continue as a feature of MACRA's MIPS program, and in connection with this, Medicare EHR program payment adjustments to eligible professionals will sunset at the end of 2018 and MIPS payment adjustments will begin on January 1, 2019.  The first performance period for MIPS began  January 1, 2017, and will afford eligible clinicians different reporting options linked to the amount of data reported and the duration of the reporting period, with positive payment adjustments generally linked to more robust reporting. On October 6, 2015, CMS and ONC released comprehensive final rules with respect to the EHR program that, among other things, established the more challenging ""Stage 3"" criteria, made certain adjustments to Stage 1 and Stage 2 standards (e.g., reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days), and finalized 2015 edition health information technology (HIT) certification criteria (which is now added to the existing 2014 edition HIT certification criteria, but not required until 2018).  Notably, under the new rules, compliance with Stage 3 standards is optional for providers in 2017, and would generally be required for all eligible providers (regardless of prior participation in the EHR incentive program) for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently.  Developers and others involved in the manufacture of EHR program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products, and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 EHR program period.  In connection with the release of the October 6 rules, HHS has also stated that it will continue to modify applicable EHR program standards.  On November 14, 2016, CMS published a final rule that will impact Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs through revisions to the objectives and measures for eligible hospitals, critical access hospitals and dual-eligible hospitals. Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs.  CMS and ONC establish criteria for certified EHR systems, and these criteria have been subject to change.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria.  Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs.  CMS and ONC establish criteria for certified EHR systems, and these criteria have been subject to change.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy these changing governmental criteria.  If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, as noted above, we are exposed to risk under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the False Claims Act.  For example, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155 million settlement and 5-year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based on allegations that the vendor, by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use payments in violation of the False Claims Act.  While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality.  Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our 53 Table of Contents business. Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers. Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements. Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties, and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Additionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important.  On September 6, 2017, the FDA issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information.  As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device. There may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care. 54 Table of Contents E-Commerce Electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships.  Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition.  The continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings. Through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives.  We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business.  We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.

(112,551)           (327,344)           (348,030) Plans of Restructuring On November 6, 2014, we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies, which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015.  This initiative originally planned for the elimination of approximately 2% to 3% of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities.  We subsequently announced our plan to extend these restructuring activities through the end of 2016 to further implement cost-savings initiatives, which ultimately resulted in the elimination of approximately 900 positions, representing slightly more than 4% of our workforce.  The total costs associated with the actions for this restructuring included $34.9 million pre-tax, which was recorded in fiscal 2015, and $45.9 million pre-tax, which was recorded in fiscal 2016.  The costs associated with this restructuring are included in a separate line item, ""Restructuring costs"" within our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2016 our restructuring activities are complete and we did not incur any additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2017. 55 Table of Contents 2017 Compared to 2016 Net Sales Net sales for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands): % of               % of       Increase                   2017       Total       2016       Total       $       %   Health care distribution (1):                                                                               Dental ..........................................................................................................................................................................................         $   6,048,813       48.5   %       $   5,555,299       48.0   %       $   493,514       8.9   %       Animal health .................................................................................................................................................................................             3,476,635       27.9               3,253,095       28.1               223,540       6.9           Medical ........................................................................................................................................................................................             2,497,994       20.1               2,337,661       20.2               160,333       6.9               Total health care distribution ............................................................................................................................................................             12,023,442       96.5               11,146,055       96.3               877,387       7.9       Technology and value-added services (2)......................................................................................................................................................             438,101       3.5               425,613       3.7               12,488       2.9               Total ........................................................................................................................................................................................         $   12,461,543       100.0   %       $   11,571,668       100.0   %       $   889,875       7.7                                                                                                                                                                               (1)       Consists of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded           and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.                                                                                       (2)       Consists of practice management software and other value-added products, which are distributed primarily to health care           providers, and financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, continuing education services for practitioners, consulting            and other services. The fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, which consisted of 53 weeks. The $889.9 million, or 7.7%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 7.2% local currency growth (5.1% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.5% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 3.6% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 0.5% related to foreign currency exchange. The $493.5 million, or 8.9%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 7.9% in local currencies (3.0% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.4% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 6.3% growth from acquisitions) as well as an increase of 1.0% related to foreign currency exchange.  The 7.9% increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 4.5% (6.5% increase in internally generated revenue, 2.4% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 0.4% growth from acquisitions) and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 9.0% (1.9% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.1% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 8.2% growth from acquisitions). The $223.6 million, or 6.9%, increase in animal health net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 6.9% local currency growth (6.3% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.3% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 1.9% growth from acquisitions).  The growth in internally generated animal health revenue is affected by the revenue for certain products being recognized on a gross basis in 2017 that had been recognized on an agency basis in the prior year.  When excluding the effects of this change, internally generated revenue grew by 6.0%. The $160.3 million, or 6.9%, increase in medical net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 6.8% local currency growth (8.4% increase in internally generated revenue and 1.6% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016) as well as an increase of 0.1% related to foreign currency exchange. The $12.5 million, or 2.9%, increase in technology and value-added services net sales for the year ended December 30, 2017 includes an increase of 3.2% local currency growth (3.5% increase in internally generated revenue, 0.8% decrease due to the impact from the extra week in 2016 and 0.5% growth from acquisitions) partially offset by a decrease of 0.3% related to foreign currency exchange. 56 Table of Contents Gross Profit Gross profit and gross margins for 2017 and 2016 by segment and in total were as follows (in thousands): Gross               Gross       Increase               2017       Margin %       2016       Margin %       $       %   Health care distribution .......................................................................................................................................................................         $   3,112,436       25.9   %       $   2,953,136       26.5   %       $   159,300       5.4   %   Technology and value-added services ......................................................................................................................................................             286,667       65.4               273,337       64.2               13,330       4.9           Total ........................................................................................................................................................................................         $   3,399,103       27.3           $   3,226,473       27.9           $   172,630       5.4 Gross profit increased $172.6 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period.  As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  Additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment.  These higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services, as well as certain financial services. The software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development. Within our health care distribution segment, gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next.  Changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin.  For example, sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products.  Conversely, sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average.  With respect to customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to office-based practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies. Health care distribution gross profit increased $159.3 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period.  Health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 25.9% for the year ended December 30, 2017 from 26.5% for the comparable prior year period.  The overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is attributable to a $104.0 million gross profit increase from growth in internally generated revenue and $125.3 million is attributable to acquisitions.  These increases were partially offset by a $70.0 million decline in gross profit due to the decrease in the gross margin rates. Technology and value-added services gross profit increased $13.3 million, or 4.9%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period.  Technology and value-added services gross profit margin increased to 65.4% for the year ended December 30, 2017 from 64.2% for the comparable prior year period.  Acquisitions accounted for $2.0 million of our gross profit increase within our technology and value-added services segment for the year ended December 30, 2017 compared to the prior year period. The remaining increase of $11.3 million in our technology and value-added services segment gross profit was primarily attributable to growth in internally generated revenue and the increase in gross margin rates.

The $127.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses within our health care distribution segment for the year ended December 30, 2017 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to $107.3 million of additional costs from acquired companies, and $19.7 million of additional operating costs.  The $3.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses within our 57 Table of Contents technology and value-added services segment for the year ended December 30, 2017 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to $2.1 million of additional costs from acquired companies and $1.6 million of additional operating costs.  As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 20.4% from 20.8% for the comparable prior year period. As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, selling expenses increased $82.2 million, or 5.6%, for the year ended December 30, 2017 from the comparable prior year period.

Interest income increased $4.3 million primarily due to increased investment and late fee income.  Interest expense increased $21.8 million primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates under our bank credit lines and interest expense related to a financing arrangement entered into during the first quarter of 2017 in Brazil.  Other, net decreased by $3.3 million due primarily to investment proceeds received in the first quarter of 2016. Income Taxes For the year ended December 30, 2017, our effective tax rate was 44.1% compared to 28.8% for the prior year period.  Our effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily higher due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the Tax Act"").  Our effective tax rate was favorably impacted in 2017 by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-09, Accounting for Stock Compensation, as well as savings from implementation of tax planning initiatives and higher income from lower tax jurisdictions.   During the second quarter of 2016, the effective tax rate was affected by a federal tax audit settlement, which reduced our income tax expense by approximately $4.5 million.  For 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 24%. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"").  The Tax Act is comprehensive tax legislation that implements complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, modification of accelerated depreciation, the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and changes to the limitations of the deductibility of interest.  Additionally, the Tax Act moves from a global tax regime to a modified territorial regime, which requires U.S. companies to pay a mandatory one-time transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S.  The transition tax is payable over eight years. Due to the complexities of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") that allows the company to record a provisional amount for any income tax effects of the Tax Act in accordance with ASC 740, to the extent that a reasonable estimate can be made.  SAB 118 allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. We have recorded provisional amounts for any items that could be reasonably estimated at this time.  This includes the one-time transition tax that we have estimated to be $140.0 million.  Within our consolidated balance sheets, $27.4 million is included in ""Accrued taxes"" and $112.6 million is included in ""Other liabilities"".  The U.S. 58 Table of Contents deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued due to the lower enacted federal income tax rate, of 21%, that was effective January 1, 2018.  The Company accrued a net deferred tax expense of $3.0 million attributable to the revaluation.  In the aggregate, for the quarter ended December 30, 2017, these Tax Act modifications resulted in a one-time tax expense of approximately $143.0 million.  Absent the effects of the transition tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 30, 2017 would have been 26.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 44.1%. The Tax Act also includes provisions to tax global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI"") and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (""BEAT"") that imposes tax on certain foreign related-party payments.  The Company is subject to the GILTI and BEAT provisions which are effective January 1, 2018.  The Company is in the process of assessing the effects of these provisions for 2018. The ultimate impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the estimate above, possibly materially, due to additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury, updates or changes in our assumptions, revision of accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations and future information that may become available.  We currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the quarter ended September 29, 2018.  If the information necessary to finalize and record the related tax impacts are available prior to the quarter ended September 29, 2018, we will book these impacts accordingly. Net Income Net income decreased $97.1 million, or 17.5%, for the year ended December 30, 2017, compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above. 59 Table of Contents 2016 Compared to 2015 Net Sales Net sales for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands): % of               % of       Increase                   2016       Total       2015       Total       $       %   Health care distribution (1):                                                                               Dental ..........................................................................................................................................................................................         $   5,555,299       48.0   %       $   5,276,407       49.6   %       $   278,892       5.3   %       Animal health .................................................................................................................................................................................             3,253,095       28.1               2,921,624       27.5               331,471       11.3           Medical ........................................................................................................................................................................................             2,337,661       20.2               2,072,915       19.5               264,746       12.8               Total health care distribution ..............................................................................................................................................................         11,146,055       96.3               10,270,946       96.6               875,109       8.5       Technology and value-added services (2) ......................................................................................................................................................             425,613       3.7               358,773       3.4               66,840       18.6               Total ........................................................................................................................................................................................         $   11,571,668       100.0   %       $   10,629,719       100.0   %       $   941,949       8.9                                                                                                                                                                               (1)       Consists of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and           generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.

The fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks as compared to the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015, which consisted of 52 weeks. The $941.9 million, or 8.9%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an increase of 10.1% local currency growth (6.7% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.5% impact from extra week and 1.9% growth from acquisitions) partially offset by a decrease of 1.2% related to foreign currency exchange. The $278.9 million, or 5.3%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an increase of 6.2% in local currencies (3.2% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.5% impact from extra week and 1.5% growth from acquisitions) offset by a decrease of 0.9% related to foreign currency exchange.  The 6.2% increase in local currency sales was due to increases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 9.0% (5.1% increase in internally generated revenue, 2.5% impact from extra week and 1.4% growth from acquisitions) and dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 5.3% (2.6% increase in internally generated revenue, 1.2% impact from extra week and 1.5% growth from acquisitions).

Health care distribution gross profit margin decreased to 26.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 27.0% for the comparable prior year period.  The overall increase in our health care distribution gross profit is attributable to a $170.8 million gross profit increase from growth in internally generated revenue and $60.9 million is attributable to acquisitions.  These increases were partially offset by a $47.2 million decline in gross profit due primarily to the effects of foreign exchange on revenues and the decrease in the gross margin rates.

Interest expense increased $5.9 million primarily due to increased borrowings under our bank credit lines and our U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization.  Higher interest rates also contributed to the increase in interest expense.  Other, net increased by $3.0 million due primarily to investment proceeds received in the first quarter of 2016. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2016, our effective tax rate was 28.8% compared to 29.3% for the prior year period.  During the second quarter of 2016, the effective tax rate was affected by a federal tax audit settlement, which reduced our income tax expense by approximately $4.5 million. During the third quarter of 2015, we received a favorable response to a tax petition, which allowed us to conclude that it was more likely than not that certain unrecognized tax benefits, which had been previously reserved, would be realized.  As a result, our provision for income taxes in 2015 included a $6.3 million income tax benefit. 62 Table of Contents Absent the effects of this income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2015, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 26, 2015 would have been 30.2% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 29.3%.  The remaining difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense. Net Income Net income increased $33.0 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above. 63 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions, purchases of additional noncontrolling interests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs, purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock.  Working capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables.  Historically, sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy-in opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements to be higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year. We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt placements.  Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services, and access to products and services from our suppliers. Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.  Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory.  We anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements. We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.  Funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may change.  Consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Net cash provided by operating activities was $545.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2017, compared to $642.6 million for the prior year.  The net change of $97.1 million was primarily attributable to working capital requirements. Net cash used in investing activities was $342.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2017, compared to $316.4 million for the prior year.  The net change of $25.9 million was primarily due to increased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds of sales of equity investments. Net cash used in financing activities was $112.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2017, compared to $327.3 million for the prior year.  The net change of $214.7 million was primarily due to increased net borrowings from debt, decreased repurchases of common stock and decreased acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries.

During the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we wrote off approximately $6.7 million and $6.2 million, respectively, of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve.   Our inventory turns from operations were 5.3 as of December 30, 2017 and  5.5 as of December 31, 2016.  Our working capital accounts may be impacted by current and future economic conditions. Contractual obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate long-term debt, including interest (assuming a weighted average interest rate of 2.7%), as well as inventory purchase commitments and operating and capital lease obligations as of December 30, 2017: Payments due by period (in thousands)       < 1 year       2 - 3 years       4 - 5 years       > 5 years       Total   Contractual obligations:                                                           Long-term debt, including interest .................................................................................................................................................     $   42,750       $   513,207       $   163,687       $   345,618       $   1,065,262   Inventory purchase commitments ..................................................................................................................................................         232,479           507,324           242,394           -           982,197   Operating lease obligations ..........................................................................................................................................................         94,038           131,461           68,446           64,674           358,619   Transition tax obligations ............................................................................................................................................................         27,400           21,400           30,900           60,300           140,000   Capital lease obligations, including interest .....................................................................................................................................         1,678           1,426           628           1,799           5,531                                                               Total .......................................................................................................................................................................................     $   398,345       $   1,174,818       $   506,055       $   472,391       $   2,551,609 Bank Credit Lines On April 18, 2017, we entered into a new $750 million revolving credit agreement (the ""Credit Agreement"").  This facility, which matures in April 2022, replaced our $500 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in September 2019.   The interest rate is based on the USD LIBOR plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.  The Credit Agreement provides, among other things, that we are required to maintain maximum leverage ratios, and contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, indebtedness, significant corporate changes (including mergers), dispositions and certain restrictive agreements.   As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility and the prior credit facility were $320.0 million and $65.0 million, respectively.  As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were $11.3 million and $13.0 million of letters of credit, respectively, provided to third parties under this credit facility and the prior credit facility. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had various other short-term bank credit lines available, of which $421.7 million and $372.5 million, respectively, were outstanding.  At December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, borrowings under all of our credit lines had a weighted average interest rate of 2.27% and 1.61%, respectively. Private Placement Facilities On September 15, 2017, we increased our available private placement facilities with three insurance companies to a total facility amount of $1 billion, and extended the expiration date to September 15, 2020.  These facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance, from time to time through September 15, 2020.  The facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance.  The term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years (with an average life no longer than 12 years). The proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, to refinance existing indebtedness and/or to fund potential acquisitions.  The agreements provide, among other things, that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios, and 65 Table of Contents contain restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership.  These facilities contain make-whole provisions in the event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates. The components of our private placement facility borrowings as of December 30, 2017 are presented in the following table (in thousands): Amount of                       Date of       Borrowing       Borrowing            Borrowing       Outstanding       Rate       Due Date   September 2, 2010       $   100,000       3.79   %       September 2, 2020   January 20, 2012           50,000       3.45           January 20, 2024   January 20, 2012 (1)           35,714       3.09           January 20, 2022   December 24, 2012           50,000       3.00           December 24, 2024   June 2, 2014           100,000       3.19           June 2, 2021   June 16, 2017           100,000       3.42           June 16, 2027   September 15, 2017           100,000       3.52           September 15, 2029   Less: Deferred debt issuance costs           (419)                               $   535,295                                                                                               (1)   Annual repayments of approximately $7.1 million for this borrowing commenced on January 20, 2016. U.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization We have a facility agreement with a bank, as agent, based on the securitization of our U.S. trade accounts receivable that is structured as an asset-backed securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years.  On June 1, 2016, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to April 29, 2019 and increased the purchase limit under the facility from $300 million to $350 million.  On July 6, 2017, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to April 29, 2020.  The borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were $350.0 million and $350.0 million as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  At December 30, 2017, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 153 basis points plus 75 basis points, for a combined rate of 2.28%.  At December 31, 2016, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 101 basis points plus 75 basis points, for a combined rate of 1.76%. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is greater than or equal to 50% of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is less than 50% of the facility limit. Borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of Long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet. 66 Table of Contents Long-term debt Long-term debt consisted of the following: December 30,       December 31,               2017       2016   Private placement facilities ...........................................................................................................................................................         $   535,295       $   342,857   U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization ....................................................................................................................................             350,000           350,000   Note payable to bank at a weighted average interest rate of 21.37%                               at December 31, 2016...........................................................................................................................................................             -           47,957   Various collateralized and uncollateralized loans payable with interest,                               in varying installments through 2022 at interest rates                               ranging from 2.56% to 12.90% at December 30, 2017 and                               ranging from 2.56% to 12.90% at December 31, 2016...................................................................................................................             34,027           35,150   Capital lease obligations (see Note 17) ............................................................................................................................................             5,093           5,416   Total .......................................................................................................................................................................................             924,415           781,380   Less current maturities ................................................................................................................................................................

Redeemable noncontrolling interests Some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 480-10 is applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest holder under the terms of a put option contained in contractual agreements.

Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share. 67 Table of Contents Additionally, some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met.  Any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income. Unrecognized tax benefits As more fully disclosed in Note 12 of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,"" we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, of $105.2 million as of December 30, 2017. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base our estimates on historical data, when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  However, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties.  Reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions, judgments and estimates, including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements: Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the sale of dental, animal health and medical consumable products, as well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized. Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable. Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is typically completed at the time of delivery. Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the services are provided. Revenue derived from multiple element arrangements, and the related deferral of such revenue (which is insignificant to our financial statements), is recognized as follows. When we sell software products together with related services (i.e., training and technical support) we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method, based upon vendor-specific objective evidence (""VSOE"") of the fair value of the undelivered elements, or defer it until such time as vendor-specific evidence of fair value is obtained. Multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service.  We allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy: first VSOE, then third-party evidence (""TPE"") of selling price if VSOE is not available, and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. VSOE exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable. Estimated selling 68 Table of Contents price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer location and other market conditions. Each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. Revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered. Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided. Accounts Receivable and Reserves The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  The reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns.  In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends.  From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results. Inventories and Reserves Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment.  In accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends. From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually.  Such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.  We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: health care distribution (global dental, animal health and medical) and technology and value-added services.  Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis. For the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015 we tested goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis consisting of a two-step approach.  The first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units, including goodwill, to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology.  If step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit, we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss, if any, that we would record for such reporting unit.  The calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill. Our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates.  We also develop estimates for future levels of gross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures.  Our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors. The estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections. 69 Table of Contents Our impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets.  This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment.  For indefinite-lived intangible assets, a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows, is utilized.  We assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually (at the beginning of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:          significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;          significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g., decision to divest a business); or          significant negative industry or economic trends. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, the results of our goodwill and intangible impairment analysis did not result in any impairments. Supplier Rebates Supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned.  The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets. Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property.  For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.  We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value.  When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.  Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee directors.  We measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Our stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. 70 Table of Contents Stock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors under the terms of our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and our 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan (together, the ""Plans"").  The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Prior to March 2009, awards under the Plans principally included a combination of at-the-money stock options and restricted stock/units.  Since March 2009, equity-based awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock/units, with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain pre-existing contractual obligations. Grants of restricted stock/units are stock-based awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions.  In the case of restricted stock, common stock is delivered on the date of grant, subject to vesting conditions.  In the case of restricted stock units, common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions.  We issue restricted stock/units that vest solely based on the recipient's continued service over time (primarily four-year cliff vesting, except for grants made under the 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, which are primarily 12-month cliff vesting) and restricted stock/units that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient's continued service over time (primarily three-year cliff vesting). With respect to time-based restricted stock/units, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price.  With respect to performance-based restricted stock/units, the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a specified period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock/units based on our closing stock price at time of grant. The Plans provide for adjustments to the performance-based restricted stock/units targets for significant events, including, without limitation, acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures, certain capital transactions (including share repurchases), restructuring costs, if any, changes in accounting principles or in applicable laws or regulations, foreign exchange fluctuations, certain litigation related costs, and material changes in income tax rates.  Over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets.  The ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the Plans. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to stock-based compensation are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results. 71 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (""FASB"") issued ASU No. 2016-09, ""Stock Compensation"" (Topic 718) (""ASU 2016-09"").  ASU 2016-09 contains amended guidance for share-based payment accounting.  We adopted the provisions of this standard during the first quarter of 2017. Under ASU 2016-09, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies resulting from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the stock-based compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes are included as a component of income tax expense as of January 1, 2017.  Prior to the implementation of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits were recorded as a component of Additional paid-in capital and tax deficiencies were recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits or in the income statement if there were no accumulated excess tax benefits.  The adoption of ASU 2016-09 reduced income tax expense by approximately $19.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2017. The ASU clarifies the classification of certain share based payment activities within the statements of cash flows.  We have elected to prospectively present the amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as a component of cash flows from operating activities.  Additionally, all cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employees' behalf when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes, which were previously included as cash flows from operating activities, are now presented retrospectively as cash flows from financing activities within the statement of cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (""ASU 2014-09""), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in United States (""U.S. GAAP""). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"", which deferred the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date. When effective, ASU 2014-09 will require us to use either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (ii) a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures to describe the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue, certain costs and cash flows arising from our contracts with customers). We have finalized our review of our various revenue streams within our two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  We have gathered data and quantified the amount of sales by type of revenue stream and categorized the types of sales for our business units for the purpose of comparing how we currently recognize revenue to the new standard in order to quantify the impact of this ASU.  We generally anticipate having substantially similar performance obligations under the new guidance as compared with deliverables and units of account currently being recognized. We do not anticipate any material changes to the timing or amount of revenues recognized for our health care distribution or our technology and value-added services reportable segments. Due to the variety of our product offerings in our technology and value-added segment, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard will depend on contract-specific terms. There will be some impact on timing of revenue recognition, which will include the following: 72 Table of Contents          We currently defer license revenue in cases where we do not have VSOE of the fair value of an element in the arrangement that has not been delivered yet such as customer support.  Under Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606, the concept of VSOE is eliminated and there are no cases where revenue is deferred due to a lack of standalone selling price.  As such, we will recognize certain revenue related to the software license earlier than current practice.          Certain upfront fees related to service arrangements are currently deferred and recognized over the estimated customer life.  Under ASC 606, the period over which we will recognize these fees will be reduced.          Revenue related to term licenses is currently recognized over the license term.  Under ASC 606, the license will be recognized upon delivery or license renewal.          We currently expense contract acquisition costs.  The new requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contracts to which the costs relate will require us to capitalize additional costs.  We will utilize the practical expedient permitting expensing of costs to obtain a contract when the expected amortization period is one year or less which will typically result in expensing commissions on all products or services except our software support contracts. In these cases, we generally will recognize revenue related to technology and value-added contracts earlier than current practice, while certain contract acquisition costs will be recognized later than current practice.  However, we do not believe the impact will be material to each of our segments or to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, we expect to adopt the standard on a modified retrospective basis and recognize an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings reflecting the cumulative impact for the above described accounting changes. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, ""Leases"" (Topic 842) (""ASU 2016-02"").  ASU 2016-02 contains guidance on accounting for leases and requires that most lease assets and liabilities and the associated rights and obligations be recognized on the Company's balance sheet.  ASU 2016-02 focuses on lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees classified as operating leases under previous generally accepted accounting principles.  For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.  ASU 2016-02 will require disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  The standard, which requires the use of a modified retrospective approach, will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted. We are currently exploring the methods we can use to gather and process our operating lease data at a worldwide consolidated level. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other"" (Topic 350) (""ASU 2017-04"").  ASU 2017-04 eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test, thereby eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of a reporting unit.  ASU 2017-04 will require us to perform our annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of those units.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we will be required to recognize an impairment charge; however, the impairment charge should not exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit.  ASU 2017-04 is required to be implemented on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  We do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2017-04 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, ""Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting"" (""ASU 2017-09"").  ASU 2017-09 clarifies guidance on determining which changes to the terms and conditions of share-based payment awards require an entity to apply modification accounting.  ASU 2017-09 requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, or equity or liability classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award.  ASU 2017-09 is required to be implemented on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. 73 Table of Contents We do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2017-09 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, ""Derivatives and Hedging"" (Topic 815) (""ASU 2017-12""), which simplifies the requirements for hedge accounting, more closely aligns hedge accounting with risk management activities and increases transparency of the scope and results of hedging activities. This ASU amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how we can assess the effectiveness of our hedging relationships.  This ASU will make more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting.  ASU 2017-12 is required to be implemented for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of ASU 2017-12 is permitted in any interim period after the issuance of this ASU.  We do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2017-12 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost.  This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  This ASU is required to be adopted using the modified retrospective basis, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance of this ASU is effective.  Based upon the level and makeup of our financial asset portfolio, past loan loss activity and current known activity regarding our outstanding loans, we do not expect that this ASU will have a material impact on the results of our consolidated financial statements. 74 Table of Contents","ITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other, and changes to the credit markets.  We attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.  These hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.  Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets.  All foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure.  We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our investments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital. Foreign Currency Agreements The value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar and the value of certain underlying functional currencies of the Company, including its foreign subsidiaries, may affect our financial results.   Fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.  Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings.  We purchase short-term (i.e., 18 months or less) foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers.  We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic exposure.  A hypothetical 5% change in the average value of the U.S. dollar in 2017 compared to foreign currencies would have changed our 2017 reported Net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. by approximately $7.3 million. As of December 30, 2017, we had forward foreign currency exchange agreements, which expire through June 27, 2018, which include a mark-to-market loss of $1.0 million as determined by quoted market prices.  As of December 30, 2017, Henry Schein, Inc. had Euro to Brazilian Real (BRL) cross currency swap contracts notionally totaling an amount of 78 million, with a reported fair value of these contracts as a net asset of $10.7 million.  A 5% increase in the value of the Euro to the BRL from December 30, 2017, with all other variables held constant, would have had a favorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by increasing the value of these instruments by $4.8 million. Short-Term Investments We limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivative instruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counter-parties to such financial instruments.  As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counter-parties. Variable Interest Rate Debt As of December 30, 2017, we had variable interest rate exposure for certain of our revolving credit facilities and our U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization. Our revolving credit facility which we entered into on April 18, 2017 and expires in April 2022, has an interest rate that is based on the U.S. Dollar LIBOR plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.  As of December 30, 2017, there was $320.0 million outstanding under this revolving credit facility.  During the year ended December 30, 2017, the average outstanding balance under this revolving credit facility was approximately $324.6 million.  Based upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving credit facility, for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points, our interest expense thereunder would have increased by $0.8 million. Our U.S trade accounts receivable securitization, which we entered into on April 17, 2013 and which expires on April 29, 2020, has an interest rate that is based upon the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 153 basis points plus 75 basis points.  As of December 30, 2017, we had an outstanding balance of $350.0 million under this securitization facility.  During the year ended December 30, 2017, the average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately $349.6 million.  Based upon our average outstanding balance for this 75 Table of Contents securitization facility, for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points, our interest expense thereunder would have increased by $0.9 million. 76 Table of Contents","ITEM 8.

Melville, NY Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. (the ""Company"") and subsidiaries as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2017, and the related notes and schedule presented in Item 15 (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and subsidiaries at December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017,  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB""), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"") and our report dated February 21, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ BDO USA, LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1984.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (in thousands, except per share data) Note 1  -  Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations We distribute health care products and services primarily to office-based health care practitioners with operations or affiliates in the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry Schein, Inc. and all of our controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are greater than or equal to 20% and less than or equal to 50% owned or investments in unconsolidated affiliates of less than 20% in which we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method.  See Note 6 for accounting treatment of Redeemable noncontrolling interests.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fiscal Year We report our results of operations and cash flows on a 52 - 53 week basis ending on the last Saturday of December.  The year ended December 30, 2017 consisted of 52 weeks, the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of 53 weeks and the year ended December 26, 2015 consisted of 52 weeks. Stock Split On August 16, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of our common stock.  Each Henry Schein, Inc. stockholder of record at the close of business on September 1, 2017 received a distribution of one additional share for every share held. Trading began on a split-adjusted basis on September 15, 2017.  The effects of the stock split on share and per share amounts have been retroactively reflected for all periods presented in this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the sale of dental, animal health and medical consumable products, as well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized. Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable. 84 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is typically completed at the time of delivery. Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the services are provided. Revenue derived from multiple element arrangements, and the related deferral of such revenue (which is insignificant to our financial statements), is recognized as follows. When we sell software products together with related services (i.e., training and technical support) we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method, based upon vendor-specific objective evidence (""VSOE"") of the fair value of the undelivered elements, or defer it until such time as vendor-specific evidence of fair value is obtained. Multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service.  We allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy: first VSOE, then third-party evidence (""TPE"") of selling price if VSOE is not available, and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. VSOE exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable. Estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer location and other market conditions. Each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. Revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered. Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Due to the short-term maturity of such investments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.  Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit of $83.6 million and $98.5 million, primarily related to payments for inventory, were classified as accounts payable as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Accounts Receivable and Reserves The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  The reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns.  In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends.  From time to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability. Inventories and Reserves Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment.  In accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.  From 85 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) time to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory. Direct Shipping and Handling Costs Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales.  Direct handling costs, which represent primarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Direct shipping and handling costs were $92.6 million, $84.1 million and $78.7 million for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. Advertising and Promotional Costs We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred.  Total advertising and promotional expenses were $15.7 million, $18.4 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015.  Additionally, advertising and promotional costs incurred in connection with direct marketing, including product catalogs and printed material, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period which is benefited, generally not exceeding one year.  As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $4.0 million and $3.5 million of deferred direct marketing expenses included in other current assets. Supplier Rebates Supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned.  The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales, in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.  Depreciation is computed primarily under the straight-line method (see Note 2 - Property and Equipment, Net for estimated useful lives).  Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the lease term. Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software.  Costs incurred during the application development stage for software bought and further customized by outside suppliers for our use and software developed by a supplier for our proprietary use are capitalized.  Costs incurred for our own personnel who are directly associated with software development are capitalized. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.  In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates.  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  Our accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, is further discussed in Note 12 of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.""  We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries. 86 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.  Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end.  Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year.  Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings. Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our objective is to manage the impact that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have on recognized asset and liability fair values, earnings and cash flows.  Our risk management policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged and be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.  We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.  Our derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements related to certain intercompany loans and certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with foreign suppliers. Our foreign currency forward agreements related to forecasted inventory purchase commitments are designated as cash flow hedges.  Our foreign currency forward agreements related to foreign currency balance sheet exposure provide economic hedges but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. For agreements not designated as hedges, changes in the value of the derivative, along with the transaction gain or loss on the hedged item, are recorded in earnings.  For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We classify the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category on our consolidated statements of cash flows as the cash flows related to the hedged item. Acquisitions The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date.  Any excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  The major classes of assets and liabilities that we generally allocate purchase price to, excluding goodwill, include identifiable intangible assets (i.e., trademarks and trade names, customer relationships and lists and non-compete agreements), property, plant and equipment, deferred taxes and other current and long-term assets and liabilities.  The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on critical estimates, judgments and assumptions derived from: analysis of market conditions; discount rate; discounted cash flows; customer retention rates; and estimated useful lives.  Some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met.  For the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, there were no material adjustments recorded in our consolidated statement of income relating to changes in estimated contingent purchase price liabilities. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.  Their interests in these subsidiaries are classified outside permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets and are carried at the estimated redemption amounts.  The redemption amounts have been estimated based on expected future earnings and cash flow and, if such 87 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) earnings and cash flow are not achieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests might be impacted.  Changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are reflected at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a ""floor"" amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually.  Such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.  We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: health care distribution (global dental, animal health and medical) and technology and value-added services.  Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis. For the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and December 26, 2015 we tested goodwill for impairment using a quantitative analysis consisting of a two-step approach.  The first step of our quantitative analysis consists of a comparison of the carrying value of our reporting units, including goodwill, to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology.  If step one results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting unit, we would then proceed to step two which would require us to calculate the amount of impairment loss, if any, that we would record for such reporting unit.  The calculation of the impairment loss in step two would be equivalent to the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill. Our use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future revenue based upon budget projections and growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates.  We also develop estimates for future levels of gross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures.  Our methodology also includes the use of estimated discount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as other factors. The estimates that we use in our discounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by management that are based upon future growth projections. Our impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets.  This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment.  For indefinite-lived intangible assets, a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows, is utilized.  We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually (at the beginning of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:          significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;          significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g., decision to divest a business); or          significant negative industry or economic trends. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income. 88 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) For the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, the results of our goodwill and intangible impairment analysis did not result in any impairments. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets. Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property.  For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.  We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value.  When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value. Cost of Sales The primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product (net of purchase discounts, supplier chargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges.  Costs related to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other costs of our distribution network are included in selling, general and administrative expenses along with other operating costs. As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  Total distribution network costs were $83.2 million, $79.4 million and $70.4 million for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders' equity.  Our comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income, foreign currency translation gain (loss), unrealized gain (loss) from foreign currency hedging activities, unrealized investment gain (loss) and pension adjustment gain (loss). Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2016-09, ""Stock Compensation"" (Topic 718) (""ASU 2016-09"").  ASU 2016-09 contains amended guidance for share-based payment accounting.  We adopted the provisions of this standard during the first quarter of 2017. Under ASU 2016-09, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies resulting from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the stock-based compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes are included as a component of income tax expense as of January 1, 2017.  Prior to the implementation of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits were recorded as a component of Additional paid-in capital and tax deficiencies were recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits or in the income statement if there were no accumulated excess tax benefits.  The adoption of ASU 2016-09 reduced income tax expense by approximately $19.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2017. 89 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) The ASU clarifies the classification of certain share based payment activities within the statements of cash flows.  We have elected to prospectively present the amount of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as a component of cash flows from operating activities.  Additionally, all cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employees' behalf when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes, which were previously included as cash flows from operating activities, are now presented retrospectively as cash flows from financing activities within the statement of cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (""ASU 2014-09""), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in United States (""U.S. GAAP""). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"", which deferred the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date. When effective, ASU 2014-09 will require us to use either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (ii) a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures to describe the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue, certain costs and cash flows arising from our contracts with customers). We have finalized our review of our various revenue streams within our two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  We have gathered data and quantified the amount of sales by type of revenue stream and categorized the types of sales for our business units for the purpose of comparing how we currently recognize revenue to the new standard in order to quantify the impact of this ASU.  We generally anticipate having substantially similar performance obligations under the new guidance as compared with deliverables and units of account currently being recognized. We do not anticipate any material changes to the timing or amount of revenues recognized for our health care distribution or our technology and value-added services reportable segments. Due to the variety of our product offerings in our technology and value-added segment, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard will depend on contract-specific terms. There will be some impact on timing of revenue recognition, which will include the following:          We currently defer license revenue in cases where we do not have VSOE of the fair value of an element in the arrangement that has not been delivered yet such as customer support.  Under Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606, the concept of VSOE is eliminated and there are no cases where revenue is deferred due to a lack of standalone selling price.  As such, we will recognize certain revenue related to the software license earlier than current practice.          Certain upfront fees related to service arrangements are currently deferred and recognized over the estimated customer life.  Under ASC 606, the period over which we will recognize these fees will be reduced. 90 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data)          Revenue related to term licenses is currently recognized over the license term.  Under ASC 606, the license will be recognized upon delivery or license renewal.          We currently expense contract acquisition costs.  The new requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contracts to which the costs relate will require us to capitalize additional costs.  We will utilize the practical expedient permitting expensing of costs to obtain a contract when the expected amortization period is one year or less which will typically result in expensing commissions on all products or services except our software support contracts. In these cases, we generally will recognize revenue related to technology and value-added contracts earlier than current practice, while certain contract acquisition costs will be recognized later than current practice.  However, we do not believe the impact will be material to each of our segments or to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, we expect to adopt the standard on a modified retrospective basis and recognize an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings reflecting the cumulative impact for the above described accounting changes. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, ""Leases"" (Topic 842) (""ASU 2016-02"").  ASU 2016-02 contains guidance on accounting for leases and requires that most lease assets and liabilities and the associated rights and obligations be recognized on the Company's balance sheet.  ASU 2016-02 focuses on lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees classified as operating leases under previous generally accepted accounting principles.  For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.  ASU 2016-02 will require disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  The standard, which requires the use of a modified retrospective approach, will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted. We are currently exploring the methods we can use to gather and process our operating lease data at a worldwide consolidated level. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other"" (Topic 350) (""ASU 2017-04"").  ASU 2017-04 eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test, thereby eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of a reporting unit.  ASU 2017-04 will require us to perform our annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of those units.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we will be required to recognize an impairment charge; however, the impairment charge should not exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit.  ASU 2017-04 is required to be implemented on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  We do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2017-04 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, ""Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting"" (""ASU 2017-09"").  ASU 2017-09 clarifies guidance on determining which changes to the terms and conditions of share-based payment awards require an entity to apply modification accounting.  ASU 2017-09 requires modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, or equity or liability classification of the award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award.  ASU 2017-09 is required to be implemented on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  We do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2017-09 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, ""Derivatives and Hedging"" (Topic 815) (""ASU 2017-12""), which simplifies the requirements for hedge accounting, more closely aligns hedge accounting with risk management activities and increases transparency of the scope and results of hedging activities. This ASU amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how we can assess the effectiveness of our hedging 91 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) relationships.  This ASU will make more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting.  ASU 2017-12 is required to be implemented for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of ASU 2017-12 is permitted in any interim period after the issuance of this ASU.  We do not expect that the requirements of ASU 2017-12 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost.  This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  This ASU is required to be adopted using the modified retrospective basis, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance of this ASU is effective.  Based upon the level and makeup of our financial asset portfolio, past loan loss activity and current known activity regarding our outstanding loans, we do not expect that this ASU will have a material impact on the results of our consolidated financial statements.

Note 5  -  Debt Bank Credit Lines On April 18, 2017, we entered into a new $750 million revolving credit agreement (the ""Credit Agreement"").  This facility, which matures in April 2022, replaced our $500 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in September 2019.   The interest rate is based on the USD LIBOR plus a spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.  The Credit Agreement provides, among other things, that we are required to maintain maximum leverage ratios, and contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants.  The Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, indebtedness, significant corporate changes (including mergers), dispositions and certain restrictive agreements.  As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the borrowings outstanding on this revolving credit facility and the prior credit facility were $320.0 million and $65.0 million, respectively.  As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were $11.3 million and $13.0 million of letters of credit, respectively, provided to third parties under this credit facility and the prior credit facility. As of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had various other short-term bank credit lines available, of which $421.7 million and $372.5 million, respectively, were outstanding.  At December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, borrowings under all of our credit lines had a weighted average interest rate of 2.27% and 1.61%, respectively. Private Placement Facilities On September 15, 2017, we increased our available private placement facilities with three insurance companies to a total facility amount of $1 billion, and extended the expiration date to September 15, 2020.  These facilities are available on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of issuance, from time to time through September 15, 2020.  The facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the lenders at a fixed rate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at the time of issuance.  The term of each possible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to 15 years (with an average life no longer than 12 94 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) years).

U.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization We have a facility agreement with a bank, as agent, based on the securitization of our U.S. trade accounts receivable that is structured as an asset-backed securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years.  On June 1, 2016, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to April 29, 2019 and increased the purchase limit under the facility from $300 million to $350 million.  On July 6, 2017, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to April 29, 2020.  The borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were $350.0 million and $350.0 million as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  At December 30, 2017, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 153 basis points plus 75 basis points, for a combined rate of 2.28%.  At December 31, 2016, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial paper rate of 101 basis points plus 75 basis points, for a combined rate of 1.76%. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is greater than or equal to 50% of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is less than 50% of the facility limit. Borrowings under this facility are presented as a component of Long-term debt within our consolidated balance sheet. 95 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described as follows:      Level 1 -  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.      Level 2 -  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted 100 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.      Level 3 -  Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability. The following section describes the fair values of our financial instruments and the methodologies that we used to measure their fair values. Investments and notes receivable There are no quoted market prices available for investments in unconsolidated affiliates and notes receivable; however, we believe the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value. Debt The fair value of our debt (including bank credit lines) as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was estimated at $1,666.1 million and $1,218.9 million, respectively.  Factors that we considered when estimating the fair value of our debt include market conditions, prepayment and make-whole provisions, liquidity levels in the private placement market, variability in pricing from multiple lenders and term of debt. Derivative contracts Derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and significant other observable and unobservable inputs.  We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements related to intercompany loans and certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with suppliers. The fair values for the majority of our foreign currency derivative contracts are obtained by comparing our contract rate to a published forward price of the underlying market rates, which is based on market rates for comparable transactions and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Redeemable noncontrolling interests Some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on third-party valuations.  The primary factor affecting the future value of redeemable noncontrolling interests is expected earnings and, if such earnings are not achieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests might be impacted.  The noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted to their estimated redemption amounts each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a ""floor"" amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.  The values for Redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The details of the changes in Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented in Note 6. 101 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) Note 10  -  Plans of Restructuring On November 6, 2014, we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies, which was expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015.  This initiative originally planned for the elimination of approximately 2% to 3% of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities.  We subsequently announced our plan to extend these restructuring activities through the end of 2016 to further implement cost-savings initiatives, which ultimately resulted in the elimination of approximately 900 positions, representing slightly more than 4% of our workforce.  The total costs associated with the actions for this restructuring included $34.9 million pre-tax, which was recorded in fiscal 2015, and $45.9 million pre-tax, which was recorded in fiscal 2016.  The costs associated with this restructuring are included in a separate line item, ""Restructuring costs"" within our consolidated statements of income.

A reconciliation of shares used in calculating earnings per basic and diluted share follows: Years Ended               December 30,       December 31,       December 26,               2017       2016       2015   Basic ........................................................................................................................................................................................         156,787       161,641       165,687   Effect of dilutive securities:                               Stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units .................................................................................................................         1,421       2,082       2,563       Diluted ..................................................................................................................................................................................         158,208       163,723       168,250 Note 12  -  Income Taxes Income before taxes and equity in earnings of affiliates was as follows: Years ended           December 30,       December 31,       December 26,           2017       2016       2015   Domestic .......................................................................................................................................................................................     $   649,657       $   625,792       $   591,320   Foreign .........................................................................................................................................................................................         173,191           130,043           129,438       Total .......................................................................................................................................................................................     $   822,848       $   755,835       $   720,758 The provisions for income taxes were as follows: Years ended                       December 30,       December 31,       December 26,                       2017       2016       2015   Current income tax expense:                                           U.S. Federal ...........................................................................................................................................................................         $   283,417       $   185,438       $   162,948       State and local ........................................................................................................................................................................             28,520           28,229           29,580       Foreign .................................................................................................................................................................................             50,084           41,357           25,104           Total current ......................................................................................................................................................................             362,021           255,024           217,632                                                       Deferred income tax expense (benefit):                                           U.S. Federal ...........................................................................................................................................................................             13,686           (18,090)           (3,381)       State and local ........................................................................................................................................................................             856           (4,809)           992       Foreign .................................................................................................................................................................................

Any future reductions       of such valuation allowances will be reflected as a reduction of income tax expense in accordance with the provisions of       ASC Topic 805, ""Business Combinations.""                                       (2)   Certain deferred tax amounts do not have a right of offset and are therefore reflected on a gross basis in        non-current assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The assessment of the amount of value assigned to our deferred tax assets under the applicable accounting rules is judgmental.  We are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating the likelihood that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the future.  Such evidence includes scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and the results of recent operations.  Since this evaluation requires consideration of events that may occur some years into the future, there is an element of judgment involved.  Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods.  We believe that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to allow us to recover substantially all of the value assigned to our deferred tax assets.  However, if future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover all of the value assigned to our deferred tax assets, we will be required to adjust our valuation allowance accordingly. As of December 30, 2017, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $9.1 million, which can be utilized against future foreign income through December 31, 2025.  Additionally, as of December 30, 2017, there were foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $156.4 million that have an indefinite life. 106 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

Our effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the Tax Act"").  Our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Accounting for Stock Compensation, as well as savings from implementation of tax planning initiatives and higher income from lower tax jurisdictions.  During the second quarter of 2016, the effective tax rate was affected by a federal tax audit settlement, which reduced our income tax expense by approximately $4.5 million which is included in the unrecognized tax benefits amount above. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"").  The Tax Act  is comprehensive tax legislation that implements complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, modification of accelerated depreciation, the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and changes to the limitations of the deductibility of interest.  Additionally, the Tax Act moves from a global tax regime to a modified territorial regime, which requires U.S. companies to pay a mandatory one-time transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S.  The transition tax is payable over eight years. Due to the complexities of the Tax Act, On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") that allows the company to record a provisional amount for any income tax effects of the Tax Act in accordance with ASC 740, to the extent that a reasonable estimate can be made.  SAB 118 allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. We have recorded provisional amounts for any items that could be reasonably estimated at this time.  This includes the one-time transition tax that we have estimated to be $140.0 million.  Within our consolidated balance sheets, $27.4 million is included in ""Accrued taxes"" and $112.6 million is included in ""Other liabilities"".  The U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued due to the lower enacted federal income tax rate, of 21%, that was effective January 1, 2018.  The Company accrued a net deferred tax expense of $3.0 million attributable to the revaluation.  In the aggregate, for the quarter ended December 30, 2017, these Tax Act modifications resulted in a one-time tax expense of approximately $143.0 million.  Absent the effects of the transition tax and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 30, 2017 would have been 26.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 44.1%. 107 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) The Tax Act also includes provisions to tax global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI"") and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (""BEAT"") that imposes tax on certain foreign related-party payments.  The Company is subject to the GILTI and BEAT provisions which are effective January 1, 2018.  The Company is in the process of assessing the effects of these provisions for 2018. The ultimate impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the estimate above, possibly materially, due to additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury, updates or changes in the Company's assumptions, revision of accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations and future information that may become available.  We currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the quarter ended September 29, 2018.  If the information necessary to finalize and record the related tax impacts are available prior to the quarter ended September 29, 2018, we will book these impacts accordingly. During the third quarter of 2015, we received a favorable response to a tax petition, which allowed us to conclude that it was more likely than not that certain unrecognized tax benefits, which had been previously reserved, would be realized.  As a result, our provision for income taxes in 2015 included a $6.3 million income tax benefit, which is included in the unrecognized tax benefits amount above. Absent the effects of this income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2015, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 26, 2015 would have been 30.2% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 28.8%.  The remaining difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for the period primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense. Provision has not been made for foreign taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, because we are permanently reinvested.   As of December 30, 2017, the cumulative amount of reinvested earnings was approximately $1.4 billion. It is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to investments in our foreign subsidiaries. ASC Topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with other provisions contained within this guidance.  This topic prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.  The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement.  In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities.  Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions taken in respect to certain tax matters. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in ""Other liabilities"" within our consolidated balance sheets as of December 30, 2017 was approximately $105.2 million, of which $79.2 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.  It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect the change to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The total amounts of interest and penalties, which are classified as a component of the provision for income taxes and included in ""Other liabilities"", were approximately $14.2 million and $0, respectively, as of December 30, 2017. The tax years subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions include the years 2012 and forward by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), as well as the years 2008 and forward for certain states and certain foreign jurisdictions.  In December 2014, the IRS issued a Statutory Notice of Deficiency for 2009, 2010 and 2011.  During the quarter ended March 28, 2015, we filed our petition to the U.S. Tax Court disputing the adjustments proposed by the IRS.  During the quarter ended June 27, 2015, we were notified by the IRS that our protest was transferred to the Appellate Divisions (Appeals Section) of the IRS.  During the quarter ended March 26, 2016, we filed our 108 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) protest with the Appellate Division. The opening appeals conference was held on June 8, 2016 and a proposed settlement was reached.  On July 13, 2016, a joint status report was filed with the Tax Court indicating a basis for settlement had been reached on all of the issues in this case.  On October 7, 2016 an executed decision document was signed by the Internal Revenue Service's Special Trial Attorney and submitted to the Tax Court finalizing the Appeals decision.  Additionally, during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 we filed a Mutual Agreement Procedure request with the IRS for assistance from the U.S. Competent Authority for an open Transfer Pricing issue which resulted in a partial settlement during the quarter ended December 30, 2017.  We do not expect this to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or the results of operations. The following table provides a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits excluding the effects of deferred taxes, interest and penalties: December 30,       December 31,       December 26,           2017       2016       2015   Balance, beginning of period .................................................................................................................................         $   90,400       $   77,600       $   65,800   Additions based on current year tax positions ...........................................................................................................             8,500           7,300           10,400   Additions based on prior year tax positions ..............................................................................................................             6,100           20,400           19,600   Reductions based on prior year tax positions ............................................................................................................

These financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables, long-term investments, notes receivable and derivative instruments.  In all cases, our maximum exposure to loss from credit risk equals the gross fair value of the financial instruments.  We continuously assess the need for reserves for such losses, which have been within our expectations.  We do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, except for long-term notes receivable. We limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and derivative instruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are the counter-parties to such financial instruments.  As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing numerous investment grade counter-parties. With respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively large customer base and its dispersion across different types of health care professionals and geographic areas.  No single customer accounted for more than 1.2% of our net sales in 2017 or 2016.  With respect to our sources of supply, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 34% and 5%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2017 and approximately 34% and 6%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2016. Our long-term notes receivable primarily represent strategic financing arrangements with certain industry affiliates and amounts owed to us from sales of certain businesses.  Generally, these notes are secured by certain assets of the counter-party; however, in most cases our security is subordinate to other commercial financial institutions.  While we have exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing assessments of their financial and operational performance. 109 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) Note 14  -   Derivatives and Hedging Activities We are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other, and changes to credit risk.  We attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.  These hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.  Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets.  All foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure.  We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying our counterparties, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital. Fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.  Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings.  We purchase short-term (i.e., 18 months or less) foreign currency forward contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to our foreign suppliers.  We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic exposure.  Our hedging activities have historically not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, additional disclosures related to derivatives and hedging activities required by ASC Topic 815 have been omitted. 110 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows present our stock-based compensation expense as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for all periods presented.  In the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, we presented $0.0 million, $(0.5) million and $2.2 million of benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation as a cash inflow from financing activities for the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee directors.  We measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Our stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. Stock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors under the terms of our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and our 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan (together, the ""Plans"").  The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Prior to March 2009, awards under the Plans principally included a combination of at-the-money stock options and restricted stock/units.  Since March 2009, equity-based awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock/units, with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain pre-existing contractual obligations.  As of December 30, 2017, there were 62,458 shares authorized and 7,426 shares available to be granted under the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 1,800 shares authorized and 270 shares available to be granted under the 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan. Grants of restricted stock/units are stock-based awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions.  In the case of restricted stock, common stock is delivered on the date of grant, subject to vesting conditions.  In the case of restricted stock units, common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions.  We issue restricted stock/units that vest solely based on the recipient's continued service over time (primarily four-year cliff vesting, except for grants made under the 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, which are primarily 12-month cliff vesting) and restricted stock/units that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient's continued service over time (primarily three-year cliff vesting). 113 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) With respect to time-based restricted stock/units, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price.  With respect to performance-based restricted stock/units, the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a specified period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock/units based on our closing stock price at time of grant. The Plans provide for adjustments to the performance-based restricted stock/units targets for significant events, including, without limitation, acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures, certain capital transactions (including share repurchases), restructuring costs, if any, changes in accounting principles or in applicable laws or regulations and certain foreign exchange fluctuations.  Over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets.  The ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined under the Plans. We record deferred income tax assets for awards that will result in future deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a deduction. During the first quarter of 2017, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09 which requires that  all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies resulting from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the stock-based compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes be included as a component of income tax expense as of January 1, 2017.  Prior to the implementation of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits were recorded as a component of Additional paid-in capital and tax deficiencies were recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits or in the income statement if there were no accumulated excess tax benefits. Stock-based compensation grants for the three years ended December 30, 2017 primarily consisted of restricted stock/unit grants.  Certain stock-based compensation granted may require us to settle in the form of a cash payment.  During the year ended December 30, 2017, we recorded a liability of $0.8 million relating to the grant date fair value of stock-based compensation to be settled in cash, as well as an expense of $0.0 million relating to the change in the fair value of these grants.  The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-based awards granted before forfeitures was $85.43, $83.90 and $70.40 per share during the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards as of December 30, 2017 was $82.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years. 114 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

As determined by our Board of Directors, matching contributions to these plans generally do not exceed 100% of the participants' contributions up to 7% of their base compensation, subject to applicable legal limits.  Matching contributions consist of cash and were allocated entirely to the participants' investment elections on file, subject to a 20% allocation limit to the Henry Schein Stock Fund.  Forfeitures attributable to participants whose employment terminates prior to becoming fully vested are used to reduce our matching contributions and offset administrative expenses of the 401(k) plans. Assets of the 401(k) and other defined contribution plans are held in self-directed accounts enabling participants to choose from various investment fund options.  Matching contributions and administrative expenses related to these plans charged to operations during the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 amounted to $39.0 million, $33.9 million and $31.5 million. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan We offer an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan to eligible employees.  This plan generally covers officers and certain highly-compensated employees after they have reached the maximum IRS allowed pre-tax 401(k) contribution limit.  Our contributions to this plan are equal to the 401(k) employee-elected contribution percentage applied to base compensation for the portion of the year in which such employees are not eligible to make pre-tax contributions to the 401(k) plan.  The amounts charged to operations during the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 amounted to $0.6 million, $0.3 million and $1.5 million. 116 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) Deferred Compensation Plan During 2011, we began to offer a deferred compensation plan to a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company and certain associated companies. This plan allows for the elective deferral of base salary, bonus and/or commission compensation by eligible employees.  The amounts charged to operations during the years ended December 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 were approximately $5.0 million, $1.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

(""Patterson""), Benco Dental Supply Co. (""Benco"")and Henry Schein, Inc. Each of these complaints allege, among other things, that defendants conspired to fix prices, allocate customers and foreclose competitors by boycotting manufacturers, state dental associations and others that deal with defendants' competitors.  Subject to certain exclusions, these classes seek to represent all persons who purchased dental supplies or equipment in the United States directly from any of the defendants or Burkhart Dental Supply Co. (""Burkhart"") since August 31, 2008.  Each class action complaint asserts a single count under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and seeks equitable relief, compensatory and treble damages, jointly and severally, and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these actions. On August 31, 2012, Archer and White Sales, Inc. (""Archer"") filed a complaint against Henry Schein, Inc. as well as Danaher Corporation and its subsidiaries Instrumentarium Dental, Inc., Dental Equipment, LLC, Kavo Dental Technologies, LLC and Dental Imaging Technologies Corporation (collectively, the ""Danaher Defendants"") in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Civil Action No. 2:12-CV-00572-JRG, styled as an antitrust action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and the Texas Free Enterprise Antitrust Act.  Archer alleges a conspiracy between Henry Schein, Inc., an unnamed company and the Danaher Defendants to terminate or limit Archer's distribution rights.  On October 1, 2012, Henry Schein filed a motion for an order: (i) compelling 118 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) Archer to arbitrate its claims against Henry Schein; (2) staying all proceedings pending arbitration; and (3) joining the Danaher Defendants' motion to arbitrate and stay.  On May 28, 2013, the Magistrate Judge granted the motions to arbitrate and stayed proceedings pending arbitration.  On June 10, 2013, Archer moved for reconsideration before the District Court judge.  On December 7, 2016, the District Court Judge granted Archer's motion for reconsideration and lifted the stay.  Defendants appealed the District Court's order.  On December 21, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's order denying the motions to compel arbitration.  On February 12, 2018, defendants filed an Application for Stay of Proceedings in the District Court in the Supreme Court of the United States, seeking to stay proceedings in the District Court pending a decision on defendants' forthcoming petition for writ of certiorari. On August 1, 2017, Archer filed an amended complaint, adding Patterson and Benco as defendants, and alleging that Henry Schein, Inc., Patterson, Benco and Burkhart conspired to fix prices and refused to compete with each other for sales of dental equipment to dental professionals and agreed to enlist their common suppliers, the Danaher Defendants, to join a price-fixing conspiracy and boycott by reducing the distribution territory of, and eventually terminating, their price-cutting competing distributor Archer.  Archer seeks injunctive relief, and damages in an amount to be proved at trial, to be trebled with interest and costs, including attorneys' fees, jointly and severally. On October 30, 2017, Archer filed a second amended complaint under seal, to add additional allegations that it believes support its claims.  The named parties and causes of action are the same as the August 1, 2017 amended complaint.   Trial is currently scheduled for May 2018.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. On August 17, 2017, IQ Dental Supply, Inc. (""IQ Dental"") filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, entitled IQ Dental Supply, Inc. v. Henry Schein, Inc., Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company, Case No. 2:17-cv-4834.  Plaintiff alleges that it is a distributor of dental supplies and equipment, and sells dental products through an online dental distribution platform operated by SourceOne Dental (""SourceOne"").  SourceOne had previously brought an antitrust lawsuit against the Company, Patterson and Benco which the Company settled in the second quarter of 2017 and which is described in the Company's prior filings with the SEC. IQ Dental alleges, among other things, that defendants conspired to suppress competition from IQ Dental and SourceOne for the marketing, distribution and sale of dental supplies and equipment in the United States, and that defendants unlawfully agreed with one another to boycott dentists, manufacturers and state dental associations that deal with, or considered dealing with, plaintiff and SourceOne.  Plaintiff claims that this alleged conduct constitutes unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, New York's Donnelly Act and the New Jersey Antitrust Act, and also makes pendant state law claims for tortious interference with prospective business relations, civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting.  Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, compensatory, treble and punitive damages, jointly and severally, and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees.  On December 21, 2017, the District Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss.  On January 19, 2018, IQ Dental appealed the District Court's order.  We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this action. On February 12, 2018, the United States Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") filed a complaint against Benco Dental Supply Co., Henry Schein, Inc. and Patterson Companies, Inc.  The FTC alleges, among other things, that defendants violated U.S. antitrust laws by conspiring, and entering into an agreement, to refuse to provide discounts to or otherwise serve buying groups representing dental practitioners.  The FTC alleges that defendants conspired in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.  The complaint seeks equitable relief only and does not seek monetary damages.  We deny the allegation that we conspired to refuse to provide discounts to or otherwise serve dental buying groups and intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action. The Company believes this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 119 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) From time to time, we may become a party to other legal proceedings, including, without limitation, product liability claims, employment matters, commercial disputes, governmental inquiries and investigations (which may in some cases involve our entering into settlement arrangements or consent decrees), and other matters arising out of the ordinary course of our business.  While the results of any legal proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty, in our opinion none of these other pending matters are currently anticipated to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As of December 30, 2017, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to claims that were probable to result in liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss.  This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our method for determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other factors, including probable recoveries from third parties. Employment, Consulting and Non-Compete Agreements We have definite-lived employment, consulting and non-compete agreements that have varying base aggregate annual payments for the years 2018 through 2022 and thereafter of approximately $18.7 million, $4.5 million, $1.5 million, $1.3 million and $0.1 million. We also have lifetime consulting agreements that provide for current compensation of $0.5 million per year, increasing $25 every fifth year with the next increase in 2022.  In addition, some agreements have provisions for additional incentives and compensation. 120 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  (Continued)  (in thousands, except per share data) We experience fluctuations in quarterly financial results.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:   timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;   timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;   timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;   timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;   changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;   supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;   changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;   costs of developing new applications and services;   our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;   uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;   unexpected regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;   exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers;   loss of sales representatives;   costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;   costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;   general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;   our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;   unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;   product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;   exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;   increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;   fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies; 122 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). Based on this evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 30, 2017 to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 123 Table of Contents Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting The combination of continued acquisition integrations and systems implementations undertaken during the quarter and carried over from prior quarters, when considered in the aggregate, represents a material change in our internal control over financial reporting. During the quarter ended December 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of a US dental business with approximate aggregate annual revenues of $16 million.  In addition, post-acquisition integration related activities continued for our global dental and animal health businesses acquired during prior quarters, representing aggregate annual revenues of approximately $511 million.  These acquisitions, the majority of which utilize separate information and financial accounting systems, have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition. Also, during the quarter ended December 30, 2017, we continued the phased implementation of a new equipment system for our U.S. dental business to centers representing approximate aggregate annual revenues of $159 million.  Additionally, we completed the implementation of a new ERP system at a dental business in Italy having approximate aggregate annual revenues of $49 million.  Finally, our U.S. medical business continued the phased implementation of a new sales commission application which now covers approximately $84 million of annual sales commission expense. All acquisition integrations and systems implementations involved necessary and appropriate change-management controls that are considered in our annual assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), updated and reissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, or the COSO Framework. Based on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 30, 2017. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017 has been independently audited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their attestation is included herein. Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. 124 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Stockholders and Board of Directors Henry Schein, Inc.

"CORE LABORATORIES N V","10-K","2018","1","ITEM 1. BUSINESS General Core Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry. These services and products can enable our clients to improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from their producing fields. We have over 70 offices in more than 50 countries and have approximately 4,600 employees. References to ""Core Lab"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""our"", and similar phrases are used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this ""Form 10-K"") and relate collectively to Core Laboratories N.V. and its consolidated affiliates. Business Strategy Our business strategy is to provide advanced technologies that improve reservoir performance by (i) continuing the development of proprietary technologies through client-driven research and development, (ii) expanding the services and products offered throughout our global network of offices and (iii) acquiring complementary technologies that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing services and products. Development of New Technologies, Services and Products We conduct research and development to meet the needs of our clients who are continually seeking new services and technologies to lower their costs of finding, developing and producing oil and gas. While the aggregate number of wells being drilled per year has fluctuated relative to market conditions, oil and gas producers have, on a proportional basis, increased expenditures on technology services to improve their understanding of the reservoir and increase production of oil and gas from their producing fields. We intend to continue concentrating our efforts on services and technologies that improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery. International Expansion of Services and Products Another component of our business strategy is to broaden the spectrum of services and products offered to our clients on a global basis. We intend to continue using our worldwide network of offices to offer many of our services and products that have been developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. This allows us to enhance our revenue through efficient utilization of our worldwide network. Acquisitions We continually review potential acquisitions to add key services and technologies, enhance market presence or complement existing businesses. More information relating to any significant acquisitions is included in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV of this Form 10-K (""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements""). Operations We derive our revenue from services and product sales to clients primarily in the oil and gas industry. In the first quarter of 2017, Core Laboratories took steps to streamline its business by realigning its reporting structure into two reporting segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. In connection with the realignment of our reporting structure, amounts previously reported in our Reservoir Management segment are now presented within our Reservoir Description and Production Enhancement segments, and prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation. Disclosure relating to the operations and financial information of these business segments is included in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 1  Reservoir Description: Encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock, fluid and gas samples to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients' reservoirs. We provide laboratory-based analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry. We also provide proprietary and joint industry studies based on these types of analyses.  Production Enhancement: Includes services and products relating to reservoir well completions, perforations, stimulations and production. We provide integrated diagnostic services to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects. We offer our services worldwide through our global network of offices. Services accounted for 73%, 79% and 77% of our revenue from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We manufacture products primarily in four facilities for distribution on a global basis. Product sales accounted for 27%, 21% and 23% of our revenue from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our product sales backlog at December 31, 2017 was $17.5 million compared to $6.8 million at December 31, 2016. Sources of raw materials for our products are readily available and we expect that our current sales backlog at December 31, 2017 will be completed in 2018. Reservoir Description Commercial oil and gas fields consist of porous and permeable reservoir rocks that contain natural gas, crude oil and water. Due to the density differences of the fluids, natural gas typically caps the field and overlies an oil layer, which overlies the water. We provide services that characterize the porous reservoir rock and all three reservoir fluids. Services relating to these fluids include determining quality and measuring quantity of the fluids and their derived products. This includes determining the value of different crude oil and natural gases by analyzing the individual components of complex hydrocarbons. We measure these hydrocarbons at reservoir conditions to determine the changes in their physical properties with changing pressure and temperature. The number of pressure-volume-temperature (""PVT"") related projects has been increasing for the last several years, and reservoir fluid analyses now contribute approximately 60% of Reservoir Description revenue. We analyze samples of reservoir rocks for their porosity, which determines reservoir storage capacity, and for their permeability, which defines the ability of the fluids to flow through the rock. These measurements are used to determine how much oil and gas are present in a reservoir and the rates at which the oil and gas can be produced. We also use our proprietary services and technologies to correlate the reservoir description data to wireline logs and seismic data by determining the different acoustic velocities of reservoir rocks containing water, oil and natural gas. The combined use of both the reservoir rock and fluid data are invaluable to oil companies to determine the most efficient method by which to recover, process, and refine these hydrocarbons to produce the maximum value added to crude oil and natural gas fields. Early evaluations and key decisions about well performance and viability are important for optimizing a reservoir. This is accomplished using our Digital Rock Characteristics (""DRC"") services which include (1) Dual Energy CT which is a non-destructive petrophysical evaluation technique to provide early time insight of reservoir lithology and reservoir quality; and (2) Micro CT which is a high resolution pore imaging service that provides early time quantification of both routine and special core analysis properties. We have developed unique analytical processes to understand the flow characteristics and saturation profiles of unconventional reservoir systems including (1) High Frequency Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (""NMR"") measurements to allow the T1/T2 mapping to gain understanding of movable vs. unmovable fluid saturation distribution of these complex systems; and (2) Enhanced Oil Recovery (""EOR"") of shale reservoirs by evaluating the effectiveness of gas cycling in nano-pore structures to significantly increase long-term production rates and volumes. Core Lab holds various patents, trade secrets, and proprietary designs for laboratory equipment required to analyze reservoir rocks as well as the properties and phase behavior of reservoir fluids. We manufacture a wide range of ambient and reservoir condition rock and fluid analysis laboratory equipment for our own use throughout our international laboratory network. Among these devices are complex, high-pressure, high temperature, reservoir condition, multi-phase flow systems and full visualization PVT cells, along with the ancillary equipment required to support these laboratory programs. We also sell equipment of this type to universities, government institutes, and client company research labs. While recognizing the need to optimize the logistical chain of our clients, from producing well to retail sales of petroleum products, a state-of-the-art IT platform CONNECT: was launched in 2016 to efficiently acquire our field data, laboratory 2 analysis and any other observations relevant to our client base. The system is designed in such a way that there is only single data entry, and that data can be used for further analysis and more importantly be shared with our clients by process flow dashboards, with key performance indicators. But also by sharing real-time data on mobile devices, enabling our clients to make quick decisions. This methodology of sharing data has been embraced by an increasing number of clients, as it has not only saved them costs, but more importantly, the data can be used for trend analysis in many ways such as the ability to forecast bottlenecks, thus eliminating waste and increasing efficiency. Two experience centers have been set up, both in the U.S. and Europe, where our clients can get acquainted with optimizing the flow of business as well as our advanced systems for data analysis. All initiatives are meant to increase efficiency and add value to our client base. During 2017, a number of new modules have been added to our suite of IT platforms that will further enhance the distribution chain of our customers, this project will continue during 2018. We are involved in numerous large-scale reservoir management projects, applying proprietary and state-of-the-art techniques from the earliest phases of a field development program until the last economic barrel of oil is recovered. These projects are of increasing importance to oil companies as the incremental barrel is often the lowest cost and most profitable barrel in the reservoir. Producing incremental barrels increases our clients' cash flows which we believe will result in additional capital expenditures by our clients, and ultimately further opportunities for us. Some of these are industry consortium projects that provide critical reservoir information to a broad spectrum of clients in a cost effective manner. Many of them examine unconventional reservoirs, particularly in the US and Canada. For example, our Permian Basin study evaluates the petrophysical, geochemical, completion and production characteristics of this very active play in West Texas. Our clients use this information, not only to improve their drilling and production activities, but also to evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture opportunities. Outside of North America we have an ongoing global shale study that examines the unconventional reservoir potential in Central and Southern Europe, North Africa, India, China and Australia, among other regions. We also have studies focused on tight sandstone reservoirs around the world and unconventional plays in the Middle East. Apart from unconventional settings, several conventional reservoir studies are currently being conducted for the deep water Gulf of Mexico and several different plays around the offshore Atlantic margins of West Africa, South America and Canada. Onshore, we have also conducted dozens of conventional reservoir studies on every continent except Antarctica. Production Enhancement We provide diagnostic services and products to help optimize completion and reservoir operations and field development strategies in order to increase recoverable reserves in the most efficient way. Two production enhancement methods commonly used are (i) hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir rock to improve flow and (ii) flooding a reservoir with water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen or hydrocarbon gases to force more oil and gas to the wellbore. Many oilfields today are hydraulically fractured and/or flooded to maximize oil and gas recovery. Although Core Laboratories is not a hydraulic fracturing company, we do provide services that are used by others to develop and optimize hydraulic fracturing and field flood projects and to evaluate the success of those projects. Our services, technologies and expertise play a key role in the success of both methods. The hydraulic fracturing of a producing formation is achieved by pumping a fluid slurry containing a proppant material into the reservoir zone at extremely high pressures. This fractures the rock and the proppant material ""props"" or holds the fractures open after the pressure pumping is complete so that reservoir fluids can flow to the production wellbore. Our data on rock type and strength are critical for determining the proper design of the hydraulic fracturing job. In addition, our testing indicates whether the fluid slurry is compatible with the reservoir rock so that damage does not occur that would restrict production. We also provide testing of various propping agents and software to help pick the best proppant based on net present value calculations of client investments. Our proprietary and patented ZERO WASH tracer technology is used to determine cluster efficiency and ensure maximum stimulated reservoir volume and increased ultimate recovery. SPECTRACHEM is another proprietary and patented technology developed for optimizing hydraulic fracture performance. SPECTRACHEM is used to aid operators in determining the efficiency of the fracture fluids used. SPECTRACHEM tracers allow operators to evaluate the quantity of fracture fluid that returns to the wellbore during the clean-up period after a hydraulic fracturing event. This technology also allows our clients to evaluate load recovery, gas breakthrough, fluid leak-off and breaker efficiency, all of which are important factors for optimizing oil and/or natural gas production after the formation is hydraulically fractured. 3 The SPECTRACHEM service is effective in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of the hydraulic fracture stimulation of long multi-stage horizontal wells in oil- and gas-shale plays throughout North America and with growing demand internationally as unconventional resource plays are developed globally. SPECTRACHEM data sets are used to determine how each frac stage is flowing. Frac stages with ineffective flows may warrant further stimulation, remedial actions and guide improvements on future frac designs. Our unique completion monitoring system, COMPLETION PROFILER, helps to determine flow rates from reservoir zones after they have been hydraulically fractured. This provides our clients with a baseline of early production information and can be compared to subsequent production logs later in the life of the well to see how hydrocarbon production from different reservoir layers or different quality rock varies over time. Our FlowProfilerTM service, a proprietary hydrocarbon-based tracer technology, which is a further development of our patented SPECTRACHEM technology quantifies the hydrocarbon production from discrete segments in multi-stage horizontal well completions and stimulations in unconventional tight-oil or gas plays. We have tracers used for oil reservoirs which are different from our tracers used for gas reservoirs. FlowProfilerTM technology and the analytical methodology for identifying the hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are the protected intellectual property of Core Lab. FlowProfilerTM technology employs a unique hydrocarbon-soluble tracer and water-soluble tracer introduced into specific and isolated stages via the stimulating proppant stream. The hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are absorbed by the crude oil and gas associated with each stage while the water-soluble tracer remains in the stimulation fluid. When the well is flowed, oil, gas and water samples are collected and analyzed in the laboratory to identify and quantify oil or gas flows from each stage and the cleanup of the stimulation fluid. Stages not at optimum flow rates can be identified, precipitating remedial efforts to increase flow and recovery rates, and to provide valuable insight for future wells. This service is being used to monitor offset well interference by sampling offset well oil, gas and water production. The amount of tracer detected in offset wells is being used to help our clients optimize both lateral and vertical well spacing and the amount of fracturing fluids for each stage. A more recent enhancement to FlowProfilerTM, is the use of our new engineered delivery system, referred to as FlowProfilerTM EDS. This technology comprises proprietary 40/70 or 100 mesh particles, chemically engineered to bond specifically with our oil tracers. This allows for precise placement of tracers in the propped fracture providing accurate identification of oil production by stage. We conduct dynamic flow tests of the reservoir fluids through the reservoir rock, at actual reservoir pressure and temperature, to realistically simulate the actual flooding of a producing zone. We use patented technologies, such as our Saturation Monitoring by the Attenuation of X-rays (""SMAX""), to help design the enhanced recovery project. After a field flood is initiated, we are often involved in monitoring the progress of the flood to ensure the maximum amount of incremental production is being achieved through the use of our SPECTRAFLOODTM technology, which we developed to optimize sweep efficiency during field floods. Our PACKSCAN patented technology is used to evaluate gravel pack effectiveness in unconsolidated reservoirs. PACKSCAN measures the density changes in the gravel pack annulus to verify the completeness of the gravel pack protection of the wellbore without any additional rig time. In addition to Core's many patented reservoir analysis technologies, Production Enhancement has established itself as a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of high-performance perforating products. Core's unique understanding of complex reservoirs supports our ability to supply perforating systems engineered to maximize well productivity by reducing, eliminating and overcoming formation damage caused during the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells. This ""systems"" approach to the perforation of an oil or gas well has resulted in numerous patented products. HERO (""High Efficiency Reservoir Optimization""), SUPERHERO and SUPERHEROPlus are examples of the patented perforating systems which quickly gained market acceptance and became industry leaders in enhancing reservoir performance. The SUPERHERO and SUPERHEROPlus charges evolved from HERO  charge technology and use a proprietary and patented design of powdered metal liners and explosives technology resulting in a deeper and cleaner perforating tunnel into the oil and gas reservoir. This allows greater flow of hydrocarbons to the wellbore and helps to maximize hydrocarbon recovery from the reservoir. The more recent charge development of the HERO Hard Rock or HERO-HR charges, resulted in Core Lab also having the deepest penetrating perforating charges on the market as certified by API testing. HEROPerFRAC is the newest next generation of charges using HERO technology. In addition to the benefits of HERO technology, HEROPerFRAC charges are designed specifically for optimizing fracture stimulation well completions by providing a uniform hole size which minimizes tortuosity effects in the rock during well stimulation resulting in less surface 4 horsepower and less time which both translate into lower costs needed to initiate the fracturing operation. In addition to optimizing stimulation operations with faster, lower cost programs, the production is also enhanced by not only the better well stimulations but the improved near debris free perforation tunnels as the well fluids come back into the casing from the rock. Core's manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada continue to meet the global demand for our perforating systems through facility expansion in addition to gains in efficiency and productivity. The HERO line of perforating charges, HEROPerFRAC, SUPERHERO and SUPERHEROPlus charges can eliminate the ineffective perforations that would otherwise limit daily oil and natural gas production and hinder the optimal fracture stimulation programs needed for prolific production from the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Niobrara and similar oil- and gas-shale formations. Core's Production Enhancement team has experienced technical services personnel to support clients through our global network of offices for the everyday use of our perforating systems and the rapid introduction of new products. Our personnel are capable of providing client training and on-site services in the completion of oil and gas wells. The patented X-SPAN and GTX-SPAN casing patches are supported by our technical services personnel. Recent market applications in Canada's steam-assisted gravity drainage (""SAGD"") environment have resulted in an upgrade in temperature ratings to as much as 600F. These systems are capable of performing in high temperature as well as high pressure oil and gas environments and are used to seal non-productive reservoir zones from the producing wellbore. Marketing and Sales We market and sell our services and products through a combination of sales representatives, technical seminars, trade shows and print advertising. Direct sales and marketing are carried out by our sales force, technical experts and operating managers, as well as by sales representatives and distributors in various markets where we do not have offices. Our Business Development group manages a Large Account Management Program to better serve our largest and most active clients by meeting with key personnel within their organizations to ensure the quality of our services and products are meeting their expectations and we are addressing any issues or needs in a timely manner. Research and Development The market for our services and products is characterized by changing technology and frequent product introduction. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new services and products on a cost-effective basis and to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner. Many of our acquisitions have allowed us to obtain the benefits of the acquired company's research and development projects without the significant costs that would have been incurred if we had attempted to develop the services and products ourselves. We incur costs as part of internal research and development and these costs are charged to expense as incurred. We intend to continue committing financial resources and effort to the development and acquisition of new services and products. Over the years, we have made a number of technological advances, including the development of key technologies utilized in our operations. Substantially all of the new technologies have resulted from requests and guidance from our clients, particularly major oil companies. Patents and Trademarks We believe our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are an important factor in maintaining our technological advantage, although no single one of these is considered essential to our success. Typically, we will seek to protect our intellectual property in all jurisdictions where we believe the cost of such protection is warranted. While we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology even where regarded as patentable. We protect our intellectual property, including through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements, legal enforcement proceedings and by other means. International Operations We operate facilities in more than 50 countries. Our non-U.S. operations accounted for 57%, 62% and 58% of our revenue from operations during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We attribute service revenue to the country in which the service was performed rather than where the reservoir or project is located while we attribute product sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of service revenue performed and recorded in the U.S. that are sourced from projects on non-U.S. oilfields. 5 The following graphs and table summarize our reported revenue by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: United States   Europe/Africa/Middle East   Asia Pacific   Canada   Former Soviet Union   Latin/ South America   Consolidated 2017 $ 284,260     $ 208,591     $ 62,429     $ 33,019     $ 37,255     $ 34,255     $ 659,809   2016 $ 224,863     $ 222,916     $ 65,115     $ 22,547     $ 35,935     $ 23,365     $ 594,741   2015 $ 338,907     $ 249,679     $ 86,001     $ 43,808     $ 41,450     $ 37,675     $ 797,520 While we are subject to fluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates relating to our international operations, we attempt to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by limiting the amount in which our foreign contracts are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. However, the ultimate decision as to the proportion of the foreign currency component within a contract usually resides with our clients. Consequently, we are not always able to eliminate our foreign currency exposure. We have not historically engaged in and are not currently engaged in any significant currency hedging or trading transactions designed to compensate for adverse currency fluctuations. Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to protection of the environment and the manner in which chemicals and gases used in our analytical and manufacturing processes are handled and generated wastes are disposed. Consistent with our quality assurance and control principles, we have established proactive environmental policies for the management of these chemicals and gases as well as the handling, recycling or disposal of wastes resulting from our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations, whether at the federal, provincial, regional, state, local or foreign levels, may require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions and discharges, and stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective obligations, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of injunctive relief in affected areas. Moreover, new, modified or stricter enforcement of environmental laws or regulations could be adopted or implemented that significantly increase our or our client's compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs, or the cost of any remediation of environmental contamination that may become necessary, and these costs could be material. For example, from time to time, legal requirements have been agreed to or proposed and adopted, in the United States that could adversely affect our or our clients' business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows related to the following: *Ground-Level Ozone Standards. In October 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") issued a rule under the federal Clean Air Act (""CAA""), lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (""NAAQS"") for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards. The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for approximately 85% of the U.S. counties as either ""attainment/unclassifiable"" or ""unclassifiable"" and is expected to issue non-attainment designations for the remaining areas of the U.S. not addressed under the November 2017 final rule in the first half of 2018. States are also expected to implement their own rules, which could be more stringent than federal requirements. 6 *Reduction of Methane Emissions by the Oil and Natural Gas Industry. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new, modified, and reconstructed oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. These standards will require the use of certain equipment specific emissions control practices with respect to, among other things, hydraulically-fractured oil and natural gas well completions and fugitive emissions from well sites. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and re-evaluate the entirety of the 2016 standards but the EPA has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the June 2016 rule remains in effect but future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time. In another example, the federal Bureau of Land Management (""BLM"") published a final rule in November 2016 that imposes requirements to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking on federal and Indian lands. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule that temporarily suspends or delays certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019. The suspension of the November 2016 final rule is being challenged in court. *Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (""GHG"") Emissions. The U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA, and require monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain onshore and offshore production facilities and certain onshore processing, transmission and storage facilities. In December 2015, the United States joined other countries of the United Nations in preparing an agreement requiring member countries to each develop reductions in GHG emissions. This agreement, referred to as the ""Paris Agreement,"" was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The United States' adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Finally, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. *Hydraulic Fracturing. While the U.S. Congress has not adopted legislation regulating hydraulic fracturing, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or pursued investigations over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and, also in June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing first-time standards to address emissions of methane from hydraulically-fractured oil and natural gas well completions.  Additionally, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands, which rule was struck down by a federal judge in June 2016. The BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2016. The appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM's issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, a legal challenge to the BLM's rescission of the 2015 rule was filed in federal court. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that ""water cycle"" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Moreover, some states and certain local governments have adopted, or are considering adopting, legal requirements that have imposed or in the future could impose, new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. *Offshore Compliance. In recent years, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (""BOEM"") and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (""BSEE""), agencies under the U.S. Department of the Interior have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be 7 drilled in federal waters. These agencies have pursued, implemented or enforce new rules, Notices to Lessees and Operators (""NTLs"") and even temporary drilling moratoria that imposed safety and operational performance measures on exploration, development and production operators in the Gulf of Mexico or otherwise resulted in a temporary cessation of drilling activities. For example, in April 2016, the BSEE published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation and maintenance of blow-out preventers, real-time monitoring of deep water and high temperature, high pressure drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements. Also in April 2016, the federal BOEM published a proposed rule that would bolster existing air-emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural-gas activity on federal Outer Continental Shelf waters including in the Central Gulf of Mexico by, among other things, requiring the reporting and tracking of the emissions of all pollutants defined by the EPA to affect human health and public welfare. However, in May 2017, Order 3350 was issued by the Department of the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, directing the BOEM to reconsider a number of regulatory initiatives governing oil and gas exploration in offshore waters, including, among other things, a cessation of all activities to promulgate the April 2016 proposed rulemaking (""Order 3350""). In addition, in September 2016, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (""NTL #2016-N01"") that became effective in September 2016 and bolsters the supplemental bonding procedures followed by oil and natural gas exploration and production operators on the federal Outer Continental Shelf waters for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines, and other facilities. However, as directed under Order 3350, the BOEM has delayed implementation of NTL #2016-N01 so that it may reconsider this regulatory initiative and, currently, this NTL's implementation timeline has been extended indefinitely beyond June 30, 2017, except in certain circumstances where there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder's decommissioning liabilities. Our compliance with such new or amended legal requirements to the extent placed into effect and applicable to us, could result in our incurring significant additional expense and operating restrictions with respect to our operations, which may not be fully recoverable from our clients and, thus, could reduce net income. Our clients, to whom we provide our services, may similarly incur increased costs or restrictions that may limit or decrease those clients' operations and have an indirect material adverse effect on our business. Our analytical and manufacturing processes involve the handling and use of numerous chemicals and gases as well as the generation of wastes. Spills or releases of these chemicals, gases, and wastes at our facilities, whether by us or prior owners or operators, or at offsite locations where we transport them for recycling or disposal could subject us to environmental liability, either from the applicable government agency or private landowners or other third parties. Such liabilities could be strict, joint and several, as is applicable in the United States under such laws as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. This could also include costs of cleaning up chemicals and wastes released into the environment and for damages to persons, properties or natural resources. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), remediate environmental contamination (including contaminated groundwater), and undertake measures to prevent future contamination. We may not be able to recover some or any of these remedial or corrective costs from insurance. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Our operations are also subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and comparable state laws in the United States, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In the United States, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration's hazard communication standard and applicable community right-to-know regulations require that information is maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information is provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens. Historically, our worker health and safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Competition The businesses in which we engage are competitive. Some of our competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of companies that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have. While no one company competes with us in all of our product and service lines, we face competition in these lines, primarily from independent regional companies and internal divisions of major integrated oil and gas companies. We compete in different product and service lines to various degrees on the basis of price, technical performance, availability, quality and technical support. Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including successful and timely development of new services and products, performance and quality, client service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. 8 Reliance on the Oil and Gas Industry Our business and operations are substantially dependent upon the condition of the global oil and gas industry. Future downturns in the oil and gas industry, or in the oilfield services business, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times as a result of numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including the level of capital expenditures of the oil and gas industry, the level of drilling activity, the level of production activity, market prices of oil and gas, economic conditions existing in the world, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulations, tax policies, political requirements of national governments, coordination by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (""OPEC""), cost of producing oil and natural gas, and technological advances. Employees As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 4,600 employees. We do not have any material collective bargaining agreements and consider relations with our employees to be good.

RISK FACTORS Our forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that may not prove to be accurate. All of our forward-looking information is, therefore, subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expected. All known, material risks and uncertainties are discussed below. Downturns in the oil and gas industry, or in the oilfield services business, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and demand for the majority of our oilfield services and products is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and generally dependent on the industry's view of future oil and gas prices. There are numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for our services and products, which are summarized as: <U+25AA> general and economic business conditions; <U+25AA> market prices of oil and gas and expectations about future prices; <U+25AA> cost of producing and the ability to deliver oil and natural gas; <U+25AA> the level of drilling and production activity; <U+25AA> mergers, consolidations and downsizing among our clients; <U+25AA> coordination by OPEC; <U+25AA> the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our clients; <U+25AA> financial condition of our client base and their ability to fund capital expenditures; 9 <U+25AA> the physical effects of climatic change, including adverse weather, such as increased frequency or severity of storms, such as hurricanes, droughts and floods, or geologic/geophysical conditions; <U+25AA> the adoption of legal requirements or taxation, including, for example, a carbon tax, relating to climate change that lowers the demand for petroleum-based fuels; <U+25AA> civil unrest or political uncertainty in oil producing or consuming countries; <U+25AA> level of consumption of oil, gas and petrochemicals by consumers; <U+25AA> changes in existing laws, regulations, or other governmental actions, including temporary or permanent moratoria on hydraulic fracturing or offshore drilling, the issuance of NTLs that eliminate or significantly reduce the ability of offshore operators to self-insure their supplemental bonding obligations, or shareholder activism or governmental rulemakings or agreements to restrict GHG emissions, which developments could have an adverse impact on the oil and gas industry and/or demand for our services; <U+25AA> stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas; <U+25AA> the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by us; <U+25AA> availability of services and materials for our clients to grow their capital expenditures; <U+25AA> ability of our clients to deliver product to market; <U+25AA> availability of materials and equipment from key suppliers; and <U+25AA> cyber-attacks on our network that disrupt operations or result in lost or compromised critical data. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oilfield services and products and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our operating results. Changes in macro-economic factors impacting the oil and gas industry may negatively affect our ability to accurately predict client demand, which could cause us to hold excess or obsolete inventory and experience a reduction in gross margins and financial results. We cannot accurately predict which or what level of our services and products our clients will need in the future. Orders are placed with our suppliers based on forecasts of client demand and, in some instances, we may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts of client demand are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into the estimates. In addition, many of our suppliers require a longer lead time to provide products than our clients demand for delivery of our finished products. If we overestimate client demand, we may allocate resources to the purchase of materials or manufactured products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to, if at all. As a result, we could hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce gross margin and adversely affect financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate client demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we could miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our client relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of service contracts or product orders could materially and adversely affect profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations. We depend on the results of our international operations, which expose us to risks inherent in doing business abroad. We conduct our business in over 50 countries; business performed outside of the United States accounted for 57%, 62% and 58% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We attribute service revenue to the country in which the service was performed rather than where the reservoir or project is located while we attribute product sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of service revenue performed and recorded in the U.S. that are sourced from projects on non-U.S. oilfields. Our operations, and those of our clients, are subject to the various laws, regulations and other legal requirements of those respective countries as well as various risks peculiar to each country, which may include, but are not limited to: <U+25AA> global economic conditions; <U+25AA> political actions and requirements of national governments including trade restrictions, embargoes, seizure, detention, nationalization and expropriations of assets; 10 <U+25AA> interpretation of tax statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide, routine examination by taxing authorities and assessment of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest; <U+25AA> international agreements that restrict GHG emissions, such as the Paris Agreement that calls for such countries to set GHG emissions targets in their own countries and to be transparent in how such countries achieve those GHG emissions targets; <U+25AA> civil unrest; <U+25AA> acts of terrorism; <U+25AA> fluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates (see section below); <U+25AA> the impact of inflation; <U+25AA> difficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of the local currency requirements; and <U+25AA> current conditions in oil producing countries such as Venezuela, Nigeria, Libya, Iran and Iraq considering their potential impact on the world markets. Historically, economic downturns and political events have resulted in lower demand for our services and products in certain markets. The continuing instability in the Middle East and North Africa and the potential for activity from terrorist groups that the U.S. government has cautioned against have further heightened our exposure to international risks. The global economy is highly influenced by public confidence in the geopolitical environment and the situation in the Middle East and North Africa continues to be highly fluid; therefore, we expect to experience heightened international risks. Our results of operations may be significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. By the nature of our business, we derive a substantial amount of our revenue from our international operations, subjecting us to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our results of operations may be adversely affected because our efforts to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws such as the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and the United Kingdom's Anti-Bribery Act (the ""ABA"") could restrict our ability to do business in foreign markets relative to our competitors who are not subject to these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that we are prohibited from using. We are subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA and the ABA, which generally prohibits us and our intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. In particular, we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to these laws. Any such violations could result in substantial civil and/or criminal penalties and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our ability to continue to work in these parts of the world discussed above could be adversely affected if we were found to have violated certain laws, including the FCPA and the ABA. If we are not able to develop or acquire new products or our products become technologically obsolete, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The market for our services and products is characterized by changing technology and product introduction. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new services and products on a cost-effective basis and to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner. While we intend to continue committing substantial financial resources and effort to the development of new services and products, we may not be able to successfully differentiate our services and products from those of our competitors. Our clients may not consider our proposed services and products to be of value to them; or if the proposed services and products are of a competitive nature, our clients may not view them as superior to our competitors' services and products. In addition, we may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies, develop new products, or achieve and maintain technological advantages. 11 If we are unable to continue developing competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our businesses and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, continuing development of new products inherently carries the risk of inventory obsolescence with respect to our older products. We are subject to the risk of supplier concentration. Certain of our product lines depend on a limited number of third party suppliers and vendors available in the marketplace. As a result of this concentration in some of our supply chains, our business and operations could be negatively affected if our key suppliers were to experience significant disruptions affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of their products. For example, we have a limited number of vendors for our manufactured product lines. The partial or complete loss of any one of our key suppliers, or a significant adverse change in the relationship with any of these suppliers, through consolidation or otherwise, would limit our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products. If we are unable to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our services and products, our operating results may be adversely affected. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our services and products. To that end, we have obtained certain patents and intend to continue to seek patents on some of our inventions, services and products. While we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology, even when regarded as patentable. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain countries. Litigation, which could demand significant financial and management resources, may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights. Also, there can be no assurance that we can obtain licenses or other rights to necessary intellectual property on acceptable terms. There are risks relating to our acquisition strategy. If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage businesses that we have acquired and any businesses acquired in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. One of our key business strategies is to acquire technologies, operations and assets that are complementary to our existing businesses. There are financial, operational and legal risks inherent in any acquisition strategy, including: <U+25AA> increased financial leverage; <U+25AA> ability to obtain additional financing; <U+25AA> increased interest expense; and <U+25AA> difficulties involved in combining disparate company cultures and facilities. The success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to continue to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. We are subject to a variety of environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, which may result in increased costs and significant liability to our business. We are subject to a variety of stringent governmental laws and regulations both in the United States and foreign countries relating to protection of the environment, occupational health and safety and the use and storage of chemicals and gases used in our analytical and manufacturing processes and the discharge and disposal of wastes generated by those processes. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for environmental liabilities, such as the remediation of historical contamination or recent spills, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the assessment of damages, fines and penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays in permitting 12 or development of projects, or the suspension or cessation of some or all of our operations. These stringent laws and regulations could require us to acquire permits or other authorizations to conduct regulated activities, install and maintain costly equipment and pollution control technologies, impose specific safety and health standards addressing work protection, or to incur costs or liabilities to mitigate or remediate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former owners or operators. If we fail to control the use, or adequately restrict the emission or discharge, of hazardous substances or wastes, we could be subject to future material liabilities including remedial obligations. In addition, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years with governmental authorities imposing more stringent and restrictive legal requirements. We anticipate that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental laws and regulations will continue, the occurrence of which may require us to increase our capital expenditures or could result in increased operating expenses. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a rule under the CAA lowering the NAAQS for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion. The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for approximately 85% of the U.S. counties as either ""attainment/unclassifiable"" or ""unclassifiable"" and is expected to issue non-attainment designations for the remaining areas of the U.S. not addressed under the November 2017 final rule in the first half of 2018. States are also expected to implement their own rules, which could be more stringent than federal requirements. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG reduction. Regulatory frameworks adopted, or being considered for adoption, to reduce GHG emissions include cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. For example, the European Emissions Trading Scheme is a program through which many of the European Union member states are implementing cap and trade controls covering numerous power stations and industrial facilities. Also, in December 2015, the United States joined other countries of the United Nations in preparing the Paris Agreement that requires member countries to develop reductions in GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would results in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States' adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. These proposed or promulgated laws and legal initiatives apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. These requirements could make our services and products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for the production of oil and natural gas, which could decrease demand for our services and products. In the United States, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking or reducing emissions of GHGs and the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs but no such legislation has yet been adopted. However, the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present a danger to public health and the environment and, based on these findings, has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of criteria pollutant emissions and that require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore production sources in the United States, which include the operations of many of our exploration and production clients. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions in the United State would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our clients' operations could require our clients to incur increased costs and also could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that they produce, which could decrease demand for our services and products. Hydraulic fracturing is a process used by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells whereby water, sand or other proppants and chemical additives are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production. Some countries outside the United States, such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and France, currently have imposed moratoria on hydraulic fracturing while other countries, such as the United Kingdom, allow fracturing activities but those activities are not as widely pursued as they are in the United States. In the United States, the fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule in June 2016 prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and published a final rule in June 2016 establishing first-time standards to address emissions of methane from hydraulically-fractured oil and natural gas well completions. Additionally, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands, which rule was struck down by a federal judge in June 2016. The BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM's issuance of a proposed rulemaking to 13 rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, a legal challenge to the BLM's rescission of the 2015 rule was filed in federal court.  Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. At the state level, a number of states have adopted, and other states are considering, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. In addition, local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions related to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our exploration and production clients' operate, those clients could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which could reduce demand for our products and services. We may be unable to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable employees, which could adversely affect our business. Our success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled engineers, geologists and highly trained technicians, and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the oilfield services industry. We may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for these skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for oil and gas. Additionally, at times there may be a shortage of skilled and technical personnel available in the market, potentially compounding the difficulty of attracting and retaining these employees. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, make capital expenditures, fund our working capital requirements and pay our dividend, and our ability to generate cash may depend on factors beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures, and pay our dividend depends, in part, on our ability to generate cash in the future. This ability is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service and repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure that any refinancing or debt restructuring would be possible or, if possible, would be completed on favorable or acceptable terms, that any assets could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales would be favorable to us or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance our indebtedness, including our ability to borrow under our existing revolving credit facility (""Credit Facility""). Banks that are party to our existing Credit Facility may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time. Because we are a Netherlands company, it may be difficult for you to take legal action against our supervisory directors or us and it may not be possible to obtain or enforce judgments against us. Although we are a Netherlands company, our assets are located in a variety of countries. In addition, not all members of our supervisory board of directors are residents of the same countries as other supervisory directors. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within certain countries upon our supervisory directors, or to enforce against our supervisory directors or use judgments of courts of certain countries predicated upon civil liabilities under a country's federal securities laws. Because there is no treaty between certain countries and the Netherlands providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, some countries' judgments are not automatically enforceable in the Netherlands or in the United States, where the principal market for our shares is located. In addition, there is doubt as to whether a court in one country would impose civil liability on us or on the members of our supervisory board of directors in an original action brought against us or our supervisory directors in a court of competent jurisdiction in another country and predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of that other country. 14 Our operations are subject to the risk of cyber-attacks that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. Our information technology systems are subject to possible breaches and other threats that could cause us harm. If our systems for protecting against cyber security risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, or client data, interruption of business operations, or additional costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyber security attacks. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Regulations related to conflict-free minerals could limit the supply and/or increase the cost of certain metals used in our manufacturing processes. In 2012, the SEC issued their final rule to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements by public companies of their use of ""conflict minerals"" (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) and whether these minerals originate in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries (""conflict area""). As our suppliers determine the original source of the conflict minerals they sell or use in their manufacturing processes, we may find that sourcing of these conflict minerals from areas outside the conflict area (conflict-free) at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities could be affected. If the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals is limited, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to purchase these conflict-free products or to purchase these conflict-free products at a favorable price or on favorable terms in the future.","ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Core Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry, primarily through client relationships with many of the world's major, national and independent oil companies. In the first quarter of 2017, Core Laboratories took steps to streamline its business by realigning its reporting structure into two reporting segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. In connection with the realignment of our reporting structure, amounts previously reported in our Reservoir Management segment are now presented within our Reservoir Description and Production Enhancement segments, and prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation.  Reservoir Description: Encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock, fluid and gas samples to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients' reservoirs. We provide laboratory-based analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry. We also provide proprietary and joint industry studies based on these types of analyses.  Production Enhancement: Includes services and products relating to reservoir well completions, perforations, stimulations and production. We provide integrated diagnostic services to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects. General Overview We provide services and design and produce products which enable our clients to evaluate reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. These services and products are generally in higher demand when our clients are investing capital in their field development programs that are designed to increase productivity from existing fields or when exploring for new fields. Our clients' investment in capital expenditure programs tends to correlate over the longer term to oil and natural gas commodity prices. During periods of higher, stable prices, our clients generally invest more in capital expenditures and, during periods of lower or volatile commodity prices, they tend to invest less. Consequently, the level of capital expenditures by our clients impacts the demand for our services and products.

Average prices for the majority of the 2014 calendar year were in excess of $99 per barrel for WTI and in excess of $105 per barrel for Brent; however, both were down to approximately $55 per barrel by the end of 2014 and less than $40 per barrel by the end of 2015. The volatility and significant reduction in the average price of crude oil during 2015 and 2016 resulted in a significant decrease in the activities associated with both the exploration and production of oil during 2015 and throughout most of 2016. However, crude oil prices, although still volatile, began to improve during the second half of 2016 and continued to strengthen during 2017, especially during the second half of 2017. On average, pricing for crude oil improved over 16% for 2017 over 2016, which resulted in much improved levels of land-based activity associated with the exploration and production of oil in the United States. In North America, the land-based rig count decreased 62% during 2015 and another 53% during the first half of 2016, which greatly impacted both services and product sales to this market over this time period. Although the North America rig count improved at the end of 2016 it still remained almost 20% below 2015 levels and continued to strengthen throughout most of 2017. We saw resilient levels of activities on development projects and producing fields in the U.S. unconventional reservoirs during the second half of 2016 which continued and expanded during 2017 as we began the recovery phase of this business cycle. Outside of North America, activities associated with the exploration for and production of oil have also decreased from 2014 levels, although not as significantly as the land-based activities in North America. Our clients' activities in the international and deepwater markets declined during 2015 and 2016 and remained at these lower levels in 2017; however, we believe these markets have shown signs of recovery as our clients have announced several new major capital projects. Results of Operations Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 We evaluate our operating results by analyzing revenue, operating income and net income margin (defined as net income divided by total revenue). Since we have a relatively fixed cost structure, increases in revenue generally translate into higher operating income results as well as net income margin percentages. Results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are summarized in the following chart: 20 Results of operations as a percentage of applicable revenue are as follows (dollars in thousands): 2017   2016   2015   2017 / 2016 2016 / 2015 Revenue:                   % Change Services $ 481,518   73.0  %   $ 470,259   79.1  %   $ 611,954   76.7 %   2.4  % (23.2 )% Product Sales 178,291   27.0  %   124,482   20.9  %   185,566   23.3 %   43.2  % (32.9 )% TOTAL REVENUE 659,809   100.0  %   594,741   100.0  %   797,520   100.0 %   10.9  % (25.4 )% OPERATING EXPENSES:                             Cost of services* (1) 334,074   69.4  %   331,688   70.5  %   387,739   63.4 %   0.7  % (14.5 )% Cost of product sales* (1) 140,166   78.6  %   110,956   89.1  %   144,913   78.1 %   26.3  % (23.4 )% Total cost of services and product sales 474,240   71.9  %   442,644   74.4  %   532,652   66.8 %   7.1  % (16.9 )% General and administrative expenses (1) 47,737   7.2  %   39,390   6.6  %   49,729   6.2 %   21.2  % (20.8 )% Depreciation and amortization 24,940   3.8  %   26,872   4.5  %   27,457   3.4 %   (7.2 )% (2.1 )% Other (income) expense, net (693 ) (0.1 )%   (344 ) (0.1 )%   3,669   0.5 %   NM   NM   Severance and other charges 1,145   0.2  %    -     -   %   22,943   2.9 %   NM   NM   OPERATING INCOME 112,440   17.0  %   86,179   14.5  %   161,070   20.2 %   30.5  % (46.5 )% Interest expense 10,734   1.6  %   11,572   1.9  %   12,380   1.6 %   (7.2 )% (6.5 )% Income before income tax expense 101,706   15.4  %   74,607   12.5  %   148,690   18.6 %   36.3  % (49.8 )% Income tax expense 18,610   2.8  %   10,748   1.8  %   33,758   4.2 %   73.1  % (68.2 )% Net income 83,096   12.6  %   63,859   10.7  %   114,932   14.4 %   30.1  % (44.4 )% Net income attributable to non-controlling interest (29 )  -   %   (36 )  -   %   85    -  %   NM   NM   Net income attributable to Core Laboratories N.V. $ 83,125   12.6  %   $ 63,895   10.7  %   $ 114,847   14.4 %   30.1  % (44.4 )%                         Diluted earnings per share attributable to Core Laboratories N.V. $ 1.88       $ 1.46       $ 2.68       28.8  % (45.5 )%                         Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 44,264       43,670       42,908                                   *Percentage based on applicable revenue rather than total revenue. ""NM"" means not meaningful. (1) Excludes depreciation. Services Revenue Services revenue increased to $481.5 million in 2017 from $470.3 million in 2016; however, services revenue for 2016 decreased from $612.0 million in 2015. The upward trend in the average price of crude oil during 2017 resulted in continued strengthening of activities associated with the exploration and production of oil during the second half of 2017. However, the most significant increase was realized in onshore activities within the United States while the decrease in international activities continued during most of 2017. Average prices for WTI crude oil increased 17% in 2017 compared to an 11% decrease in 2016 and average prices for Brent crude oil increased by 24% in 2017 compared to a 17% decrease in 2016. As a result, the average global rig count climbed 27% in 2017 compared to a decline of 32% in 2016, primarily driven by increases in the North American rig count. Over this same time period, our service revenue increased slightly by 2.4% in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased only 23% in 2016 compared to 2015, as demand for our analytical, diagnostic, and completion services was less impacted by the significant decrease in drilling activities. Wells must be drilled and/or completed, stimulated, cored and have reservoir fluid samples collected, before we see the benefits of the increased commodity prices. The improvements in global crude oil prices during 2017 are positive indicators of a balancing market and support for future investments, as we continued our focus on worldwide crude oil related projects, including those related to the development of fields offshore South America and in the Middle East. Product Sales Revenue Product sales revenue, which is tied more to completions in North America, increased 43% to $178.3 million in 2017 from $124.5 million in 2016; however, product sales revenue for 2016 decreased from $185.6 million in 2015.The average rig count for the U.S. and Canada increased 38% during 2017 compared to a 45% decrease in 2016. The 43% increase in product sales revenue outpaced the rig count increase due to our differentiated well completion product sales surpassing the industry activity levels in North America. 21 Cost of Services, excluding depreciation Cost of services was relatively unchanged at $334.1 million in 2017 compared to $331.7 million in 2016; however, cost of services for 2016 decreased from $387.7 million in 2015. As a percentage of services revenue, cost of services improved to 69% in 2017 from 71% in 2016 which was up from 63% in 2015. The improvement in cost of services as a percentage of services revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily reflective of how our fixed cost structure is being absorbed by increased revenue. The decline of cost of services as a percentage of services revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to our fixed cost structure being absorbed on lower revenues in 2016 when compared to 2015. We took actions to reduce our cost structure in response to the sharp decline in global activity during 2015. See section ""Severance and Other Charges"" below. Cost of Product Sales, excluding depreciation Cost of product sales increased to $140.2 million in 2017 from $111.0 million in 2016; however, cost of product sales for 2016 decreased from $144.9 million in 2015. As a percentage of product sales revenue, cost of sales improved to 79% for 2017 from 89% for 2016, which was up from 78% for 2015. The improvement in cost of product sales as a percentage of sales revenue in 2017 was primarily due to the improved absorption rates of our fixed costs. The decline in cost of product sales as a percentage of sales revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our fixed cost structure not being fully absorbed on lower revenues in 2016 when compared to 2015. We took actions to reduce our cost structure in response to the sharp decline in global activity during 2015. See section ""Severance and Other Charges"" below. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative (""G&A"") expenses include corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operations. G&A expenses were $47.7 million in 2017 compared to $39.4 million and $49.7 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The variances are primarily due to changes in compensation expense during those periods. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense of $24.9 million in 2017 decreased compared to $26.9 million in 2016 and $27.5 million in 2015. Other (Income) Expense, net The components of Other (income) expense, net, were as follows (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31,     2017   2016   2015 Sale of assets   $ (346 )   $ (618 )   $ (408 ) Results of non-consolidated subsidiaries   (332 )   (506 )   (383 ) Foreign exchange   916     1,832     4,507   Interest income    -       -      (56 ) Rents and royalties   (454 )   (420 )   (484 ) Other, net   (477 )   (632 )   493   Total Other (income) expense, net   $ (693 )   $ (344 )   $ 3,669 22 Foreign exchange gains and losses are summarized in the following table (in thousands):  For the Years Ended December 31, (Gains) losses by currency 2017   2016   2015   British Pound $ (92 )   $ 807     $ 434     Canadian Dollar (95 )   (137 )   1,848     Euro 1,413     (49 )   (908 )   Indonesian Rupiah 78     37     315     Russian Ruble (161 )   160     (45 )   Other currencies, net (227 )   1,014     2,863   Total (gain) loss, net $ 916     $ 1,832     $ 4,507 Severance and Other Charges In 2017, as part of the efforts to streamline its business, the Company recorded $1.1 million of severance compensation and other charges. In 2015, in response to lower commodity pricing for crude oil and reduced spending by our clients on their oil and gas fields, we reduced our cost structure, primarily through a reduction in our workforce, to better align with the decreasing activity levels into the foreseeable future. As a result of these cost reductions, we recorded severance charges of $8.8 million and a charge to income associated with the impairment of certain equipment and intangible assets and facility exit costs of $5.5 million. Also during 2015, we recorded loss contingencies for various ongoing legal issues of $8.6 million. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by $0.8 million to $10.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreased average borrowings on our revolving Credit Facility. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate was 18.3%, 14.4%, and 22.7% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Income tax expense of $18.6 million in 2017 increased by $7.9 million compared to $10.7 million in 2016 due to an increase in taxable income in 2017, primarily in the United States. Income tax expense associated with taxable income recognized in the United States increased by $8.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016. No other jurisdiction in which we operate had a material change in income tax expense. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. We recorded a $1.6 million non-cash discrete tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of revaluing deferred tax positions for the net impact of the reduction in tax rate. We are continuing our analysis of the effects this tax reform will have on the Company in future periods. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of income tax expense. Segment Analysis The following charts and tables summarize the annual revenue and operating results for our two complementary business segments. 23 Segment Revenue Segment Revenue For the Years Ended December 31,  (dollars in thousands) 2017   % Change   2016   % Change   2015 Reservoir Description $ 415,220     (2.6 )%   $ 426,205     (17.2 )%   $ 514,845   Production Enhancement 244,589     45.1  %   168,536     (40.4 )%   282,675     Total Revenue $ 659,809     10.9  %   $ 594,741     (25.4 )%   $ 797,520 Segment Operating Income For the Years Ended December 31,  (dollars in thousands) 2017   % Change   2016   % Change   2015 Reservoir Description $ 66,500     (15.7 )%   $ 78,881     (36.1 )%   $ 123,505   Production Enhancement 46,459     545.4  %   7,198     (81.2 )%   38,210   Corporate and other (1) (519 )   NM     100     NM     (645 )    Operating Income $ 112,440     30.5  %   $ 86,179     (46.5 )%   $ 161,070                       (1)  ""Corporate and other"" represents those items that are not directly relating to a particular segment.

Segment Operating Income Margins (1) For the Years Ended December 31,   2017     2016     2015   Margin     Margin     Margin Reservoir Description 16.0 %     18.5 %     24.0 % Production Enhancement 19.0 %     4.3 %     13.5 %    Total Company 17.0 %     14.5 %     20.2 % (1)  Calculated by dividing ""Operating Income"" by ""Revenue."" 24 Reservoir Description Revenue for our Reservoir Description segment decreased to $415.2 million in 2017 compared to $426.2 million in 2016 and $514.8 million in 2015. The decreases in revenues in 2017 and 2016 as compared to each corresponding prior year were primarily due to the reduced international and deepwater project activity levels during 2016 and most of 2017. This segment's operations continue to work on large-scale, long-term, crude-oil and LNG projects with an emphasis on producing fields located in offshore developments and international markets. We continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in the Asia-Pacific areas, offshore West and East Africa, the eastern Mediterranean region and the Middle East, including Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Operating income decreased to $66.5 million in 2017 from $78.9 million in 2016 and $123.5 million in 2015. The decreases in operating income in 2017 and 2016 as compared to each corresponding prior year were due to lower activity levels. Operating margins were 16.0% in 2017 down from 18.5% in 2016 and 24.0% in 2015. Production Enhancement Revenue for our Production Enhancement segment increased to $244.6 million in 2017 compared to $168.5 million in 2016; however, decreased from $282.7 million in 2015. The increase in onshore North America industry activity during 2017 compared to 2016 increased demand for our products associated with land-based completion of oil wells in U.S. unconventional developments while the decrease in North America industry activity during 2016 compared to 2015 reduced demand for these products. Operating income for this segment increased to $46.5 million in 2017 from $7.2 million in 2016 and $38.2 million in 2015. Operating margins were 19.0% in 2017 up from 4.3% in 2016 and 13.5% in 2015. The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to increased demand for our higher margin products and services and the impact of higher revenue on our fixed-cost structure in 2017. The decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to decreased revenue and the impact of our fixed-cost structure on lower revenue in 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources General We have historically financed our activities through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities, equity financing and the issuance of debt. Cash flows from operating activities provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and our dividend and share repurchase programs. If necessary, we supplement this cash flow with borrowings under bank credit facilities to finance some capital expenditures and business acquisitions. As we are a Netherlands holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. Our cash availability is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us. There are no restrictions preventing any of our subsidiaries from repatriating earnings, and there are no restrictions or income taxes associated with distributing cash to the parent company through loans or advances. As of December 31, 2017, $9.8 million of our $14.4 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP"" or ""GAAP""). We utilize the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash paid for capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and operating activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating profit, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for distribution because we may have other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Moreover, since free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, free cash flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The following table reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 25 For the Years Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow Calculation 2017   2016   2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 124,271     $ 131,887     $ 219,100   Less: cash paid for capital expenditures (18,775 )   (11,356 )   (22,797 ) Free cash flow $ 105,496     $ 120,531     $ 196,303 Free cash flow as a percent of net income of 126.9% continued to be strong even though free cash flow decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2015. The decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in both working capital and capital expenditures as the activity levels in the oil industry improved. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in cash flow from operating activities as a result of lower activity levels for the oil and gas industry. Cash Flows The following table summarizes cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Cash provided by/(used in):   Operating activities $ 124,271     $ 131,887     $ 219,100   Investing activities (20,557 )   (14,721 )   (39,654 ) Financing activities (104,078 )   (124,896 )   (180,302 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (364 )   $ (7,730 )   $ (856 ) The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in working capital, offset by an increase in net income while the decrease in cash provided by operations in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the industry downturn resulting in a year-over-year decrease in net income, partially offset by reductions in working capital. Cash flow used in investing activities in 2017 increased $5.8 million compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased capital expenditures. Cash flow used in investing activities in 2016 decreased $24.9 million compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a $13.8 million acquisition in 2015 and lower capital expenditures in 2016. Cash flow used in financing activities in 2017 decreased $20.8 million compared to 2016. Cash flow used in financing activities in 2016 decreased $55.4 million compared to 2015. During 2017, we used $16.9 million to repurchase our common shares, $97.1 million to pay dividends, and increased our debt balance by $10 million. During 2016, we used $7.2 million to repurchase our common shares, $95.1 million to pay dividends, and decreased our debt balance by $215 million through the issuance of new shares. During 2015, we used $159.7 million to repurchase our common shares and $94.2 million to pay dividends, offset by an increase in our debt balance of $77 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 158,569 shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $16.9 million, or an average price of $106.63 per share. The repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management pursuant to shareholder authorization. We regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to fund restricted shares that vest or to finance future acquisitions. Under Dutch law and subject to certain Dutch statutory provisions and shareholder approval, we can hold a maximum of 50% of our issued shares in treasury. We currently have shareholder approval to hold 10% of our issued share capital in treasury. On May 18, 2017 at our annual shareholders meeting, our shareholders authorized the extension of our share repurchase program until November 18, 2018 to purchase up to 10% of our issued share capital. We believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders. Our share price has increased from $4.03 per share in 2002, when we began to repurchase shares, to $109.55 per share on December 31, 2017, an increase of over 2,618%. Credit Facility and Available Future Liquidity In 2011, we issued two series of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $150 million (""Senior Notes"") in a private placement transaction. Series A consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.01% and are due in full on September 30, 2021. Series B consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.11% and are due in full on September 30, 2023. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30. 26 The terms of our revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") allow an aggregate borrowing capacity of $400 million and to increase the uncommitted availability by an additional $50 million to bring the total borrowings available to $450 million if certain prescribed conditions are met by the Company. The Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus 1.25% to a maximum of LIBOR plus 2.0%. Any outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due August 29, 2019, when the Credit Facility matures. Interest payment terms are variable depending upon the specific type of borrowing under this facility. Our available capacity at any point in time is subject to all terms of the agreements, and is reduced by borrowings outstanding at the time and outstanding letters of credit which totaled $14.3 million at December 31, 2017, resulting in an available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of $307.7 million. In addition to those items under the Credit Facility, we had $14.0 million of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds from other sources as of December 31, 2017. The terms of the Credit Facility and Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in each agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters. The Credit Facility has the more restrictive covenants with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.5 to 1.0. We believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants contained in our credit agreements. Certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co-borrowers under the Credit Facility and Senior Notes. In 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of $25 million, we fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 1.73% through August 29, 2019, and under the second swap agreement of $25 million, we fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.50% through August 29, 2024. Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are highly effective. Unrealized losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and are recognized in income as an increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense. In addition to our repayment commitments under our Credit Facility and our Senior Notes, we have non-cancellable operating lease arrangements under which we lease property including land, buildings, office equipment and vehicles. The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations under these arrangements (in thousands): Total   Less than 1 year   1-3 Years   3-5 Years   More than 5 Years Contractual Obligations:   Debt (1) $ 218,000     $  -      $ 68,000     $ 75,000     $ 75,000   Operating leases 61,260     15,077     18,965     10,971     16,247   Pension (2) 1,362     1,362      -       -       -        Total contractual obligations $ 280,622     $ 16,439     $ 86,965     $ 85,971     $ 91,247                       (1)  Not included in the above balances are anticipated cash payments for interest of $6.1 million a year for 2018-2021 and cash payments for interest of $3.1 million a year for 2022-2023 for a total of $30.6 million. (2)  Our Dutch pension plan requires annual employer contributions. Amounts payable in the future will be based on future workforce factors which cannot be projected beyond one year. We have no significant purchase commitments or similar obligations outstanding at December 31, 2017. Not included in the table above are uncertain tax positions of $10.1 million that we have accrued for at December 31, 2017, as the amounts and timing of payment, if any, are uncertain. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of this amount. At December 31, 2017, we had tax net operating loss carry-forwards in various jurisdictions of  $32.7 million. Although we cannot be certain that these operating loss carry-forwards will be utilized, we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry-forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017. If unused, those carry-forwards which are subject to expiration may expire during the years 2017-2027. During 2017, $1.1 million of net operating loss carry-forwards which carried a full valuation allowance expired unused. 27 We expect our investment in capital expenditures to track client demand for our services and products. Given the improving, but still uncertain, trend in industry activity levels, we have not determined, at this time, the level of investment that will be made in 2018. We will, however, continue to invest to fund the purchase of instrumentation, tools and equipment along with expenditures to replace obsolete or worn-out instrumentation, tools and equipment, to consolidate certain facilities to gain operational efficiencies, and to increase our presence where requested by our clients. In addition, we plan to continue to (i) repurchase our common shares on the open market through our share repurchase program, (ii) pay a dividend and (iii) if available in the market at acceptable valuations, acquire complementary technologies. Our ability to continue these initiatives depends on, among other things, market conditions and our ability to generate free cash flow. Our ability to maintain and increase our operating income and cash flows is largely dependent upon continued investing activities. We are a Netherlands holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted through subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us. We believe our future cash flows from operating activities, supplemented by our borrowing capacity under existing facilities and our ability to issue additional equity should be sufficient to meet our contractual obligations, capital expenditures, working capital needs, dividend payments, debt requirements and to finance future acquisitions. Other Matters In a letter dated October 4, 2017, the Company was informed by the U.S. Department of Justice, that in regard to the investigation by the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the ""Department"") into the Company concerning possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to the Company's interactions with Unaoil (which we first disclosed in our Q2 2016 quarterly report on Form 10-Q), the Department has closed its inquiry without taking any action against the Company.  Specifically, the Department stated that ""based upon the information known to the Department at this time, it has closed its inquiry into the Company in connection with this matter. The Department appreciates the Company's cooperation during the investigation"". In a letter dated February 5, 2018, the Company was informed by the SEC, that they have concluded their investigation as to the Company's connection with Unaoil and they do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the Commission against the Company. Outlook Our long-term growth strategies remain essentially unchanged. We will continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening or expanding facilities in strategic areas, continue the development of new services and products to meet our client needs and realizing synergies within our business lines. We believe our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service clients who have global operations in addition to the national oil companies. We have established internal earnings targets that are based on market conditions existing at the time our targets were established. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the members of OPEC announced a framework to reduce their daily crude oil production. This event, in the Company's opinion, will likely serve as an important catalyst that could speed the re-balancing of the crude oil markets which may provide for a significant recovery in industry activity. Based on recent developments, and modest strengthening in the price of crude oil and natural gas, we believe that the level of activities and workflows experienced in 2017 will continue into 2018 and will strengthen for North America. Additionally, we believe the trend in recent public announcements of major offshore and international projects by our clients will continue, and these announcements are signs that a recovery of the offshore deepwater and international markets are also improving. An increase in the activities in these markets could positively impact our revenues, operating income and operating margins as well. We expect to meet ongoing working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and funding of our dividend and share repurchase programs from a combination of cash on hand, cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under our Credit Facility. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and determine the adequacy of our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. By nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate 28 under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The following transaction types require significant judgment and, therefore, are considered critical accounting policies as of December 31, 2017. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate whether client receivables are collectible. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and monitor collections and payments in order to maintain a provision for estimated uncollectible accounts based on our historical collection experience and our current aging of client receivables outstanding in addition to clients' representations and our understanding of the economic environment in which our clients operate. Based on our review, we establish or adjust allowances for specific clients and the accounts receivable as a whole. Our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased to $2.6 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $3.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Income Taxes Our income tax expense includes income taxes of the Netherlands, the U.S. and other foreign countries as well as local, state and provincial income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled. We estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets (particularly, net operating loss carry-forwards). Any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Valuation allowances of our net deferred tax assets aggregated to $8.2 million and $10.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested. Should we make a distribution of the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, we may be required to record additional taxes. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return. We also recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Long-Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. They are depreciated using the straight-line method based on their individual estimated useful lives, except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the remaining lease term, if shorter. We estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets based on historical data of similar assets. When long-lived assets are sold or retired, the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income. These capitalized long-lived assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes. Intangible assets, including patents, trademarks, and trade names, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangibles with determinable lives are amortized using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the intangible. Intangibles with indeterminable lives, which consist primarily of corporate trade names, are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. We review our long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recovered over their remaining service lives. Indicators of possible impairment may include significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located, extended periods of idle use, declining revenue or cash flow or overall changes in general market conditions. Whenever possible impairment is indicated, we compare the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from use, plus salvage value, less the costs of the subsequent disposition of the assets. If impairment is still indicated, we compare the fair value of the assets to the carrying amount, and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. We did not record any material impairment charges relating to our long-lived assets held for use during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We record goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. 29 We evaluated our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units, which are our reportable segments, to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted future cash flow analysis. Estimated future cash flows were based on the company's best estimate of future performance. Our impairment analysis is quantitative; however, it includes subjective estimates based on assumptions regarding future growth rates, interest rates and operating expenses. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value determined, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We did not record impairment charges relating to our goodwill or our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We have never identified nor recorded any impairments relating to the goodwill of our current continuing operations. Obsolete Inventory We forecast client demand, considering changes in technology which could result in obsolescence. Our valuation reserve for obsolete inventory is based on historical regional sales trends, and various other assumptions and judgments including future demand for this inventory. Our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory. Our valuation reserve for obsolete inventory at December 31, 2017 was $3.2 million compared to $3.5 million at December 31, 2016. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of our Dutch employees hired before 2007. We utilize an actuary to assist in determining the value of the projected benefit obligation. This valuation requires various estimates and assumptions concerning mortality, future pay increases, expected return on plan assets and discount rate used to value our obligations. We recognize net periodic benefit cost based upon these estimates. As required by current accounting standards, we recognize net periodic pension costs associated with this plan in income from current operations and recognize the unfunded status of the plan, if any, as a long-term liability. In addition, we recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic pension cost. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Furthermore, we sponsor several defined contribution plans for the benefit of our employees. We expense these contributions in the period the contribution is made. Stock-Based Compensation We have two stock-based compensation plans, as described in further detail in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate the probability that certain of our stock-based plans will meet targets established within the respective agreements and result in the vesting of such awards. In addition, we derive an estimated forfeiture rate that is used in calculating the expense for these awards. For new awards issued and awards modified, repurchased or canceled, the compensation expense is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for those awards earned over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value is determined by calculating the discounted value of the shares over the vesting period and applying an estimated forfeiture rate. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than normal operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements such as securitization agreements, liquidity trust vehicles, synthetic leases or special purpose entities. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K and the documents incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These ""forward-looking statements"" are based on an analysis of currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain and investors should recognize that events and actual results could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations. By way of illustration, when used in this document, words such as ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""expect"", ""intend"", ""estimate"", ""project"", ""will"", ""should"", ""could"", ""may"", ""predict"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the intent, belief or current 30 expectations of us or our management, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us and the industry in which we operate, including, among other things:  our ability to continue to develop or acquire new and useful technology;  the realization of anticipated synergies from acquired businesses and future acquisitions;  our dependence on one industry, oil and gas, and the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our clients;  competition in the markets we serve;  the risks and uncertainties attendant to adverse industry, political, economic and financial market conditions, including stock prices, government regulations, interest rates and credit availability;  unsettled political conditions, war, civil unrest, currency controls and governmental actions in the numerous countries in which we operate;  changes in the price of oil and natural gas;  integration of acquired businesses; and  the effects of industry consolidation. Our businesses depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil, which could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The above description of risks and uncertainties is by no means all-inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider. For a more detailed description of risk factors, please see ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K and our reports and registration statements filed from time to time with the SEC. All forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date of this Form 10-K. We do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements that we may make in this Form 10-K or other documents, reports, filings or press releases, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Pronouncements Adopted in 2017 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 (""Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory"") to require the measurement of inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This pronouncement is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted this standard for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2017 and applied the adoption prospectively. The adoption of this standard had no effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 (""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting"") to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including accounting for forfeitures, excess tax benefit/expense, and tax withholding requirements. Under this new guidance, (1) companies will have the option to estimate how many shares in a grant will be forfeited or to elect to recognize forfeitures as they occur; (2) all excess tax benefit and expense will be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement as a discrete item to the quarter, and the accumulated benefits in APIC are eliminated; and (3) companies will be able to withhold share amounts up to the statutory maximum and the award will still be classified as equity. This pronouncement is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted this standard for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2017 and applied the adoption prospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to the financial statements, but will result in timing differences in the recognition of stock compensation expense as we will no longer be estimating forfeitures, but accounting for them as they occur, and the reclassification of excess tax benefit/expense on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 31 Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (""Revenue from Contracts with Customers""), which provides guidance on revenue recognition. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance requires entities to apply a five-step method to (1) identify the contract(s) with customers; (2) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We have completed our analysis of the standard's impact on our revenues by looking at all of our revenue streams to determine the impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The adoption of this standard will not result in any material changes to our revenue recognition policies and procedures nor to our financial statements, but extensive additional disclosures will be required. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 (""Leases""), which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (""ROU"") model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We anticipate the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, increasing both asset balances and liability balances; however, there should not be a material impact to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 (""Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"") which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 (""Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost""), which will require that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this standard will have an impact only on the classification in the income statement of the other components of net benefit cost which will be reflected outside of income from operations, but not on net income.","ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates. We do not believe that our exposure to market risks, which are primarily related to interest rate changes, is material. Interest Rate Risk We maintain certain debt instruments at a fixed rate whose fair value will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and market perception of our credit risk. The fair value of our debt at December 31, 2017 and 2016 approximated the book value. In 2014, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 1.73% through August 29, 2019, and under the second swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.50% through August 29, 2024. Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are highly effective. Unrealized losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component 32 of accumulated other comprehensive loss and are recognized in income as an increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense. From time to time, we are exposed to interest rate risk on our Credit Facility debt for amounts outstanding in excess of $50 million, which carries a variable interest rate. At December 31, 2017, we had an outstanding balance of $78 million. A 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk We operate in a number of international areas which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We do not currently hold or issue forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes (a foreign exchange contract is an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate). Foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar (""USD"") against foreign currencies and are included in other (income) expense in the statements of operations. We recognized foreign exchange losses in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency, as well as in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency. We recognized foreign exchange gains in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency, as well as in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency. Credit Risk Our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Substantially all cash and cash equivalents are on deposit at commercial banks or investment firms. Our trade receivables are with a variety of domestic, international and national oil and gas companies. Management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the creditworthiness and financial resources of these financial institutions and companies.","ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA For the financial statements and supplementary data required by this Item 8, see Part IV ""Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.""","ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange 33 Commission. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017 at the reasonable assurance level. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Further, the design of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment using these criteria, our management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, has been audited by KPMG, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000229/0001000229-18-000025-index.html"
"KENTUCKY BANCSHARES INC /KY/","10-K","2018","1","Item 1.  Business General Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. (""Company,"" ""Kentucky,"" ""we,"" ""our"" and ""us"") is a bank holding company headquartered in Paris, Kentucky.  The Company was organized in 1981 and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (""BHCA""). The Company conducts its business in the Commonwealth of Kentucky through one banking subsidiary, Kentucky Bank, and one non-bank subsidiary KBI Insurance Company. Kentucky Bank is a commercial bank and trust company organized under the laws of Kentucky.  Kentucky Bank has its main office in Paris (Bourbon County), with additional offices in Paris, Cynthiana (Harrison County), Georgetown (Scott County), Lexington (Fayette), Morehead (Rowan County), Nicholasville (Jessamine County), Richmond (Madison County), Sandy Hook (Elliott County), Versailles (Woodford County), Wilmore (Jessamine County) and Winchester (Clark County).  The deposits of Kentucky Bank are insured up to prescribed limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (""DIF"") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (""FDIC"").  KBI Insurance Company is a captive insurance subsidiary and was incorporated in 2014. The Company had total assets of $1.1 billion, total deposits of $815.3 million and stockholders' equity of $100.3 million as of December 31, 2017.  The Company's principal executive office is located at 339 Main Street, Paris, Kentucky  40361, and the telephone number at that address is (859) 987-1795. Business Strategy The Company's current business strategy is to operate a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community bank with a significant presence in Central and Eastern Kentucky.  Management believes the optimum way to grow the Company is by attracting new loan and deposit customers within its existing markets through its product offerings and premier customer service.  Management continues to consider opportunities for branch expansion and will also consider acquisition opportunities that help advance its strategic objectives. Lending Kentucky Bank is engaged in general full-service commercial and consumer banking.  A significant part of Kentucky Bank's operating activities include originating loans, approximately 81% of which are secured by real estate at December 31, 2017.  Kentucky Bank makes commercial, agricultural and real estate loans to its commercial customers, with emphasis on small-to-medium-sized industrial, service and agricultural businesses.  It also makes residential mortgage, installment and other loans to its individual and other non-commercial customers. Loan Rates:  Kentucky Bank offers variable and fixed rate loans.  Loan rates on variable rate loans generally adjust upward or downward based on changes in the loan's index.  Rate adjustments on variable rate loans are made from 1 day to 5 years.  Variable rate loans may contain provisions that cap the amount of interest rate increases or decreases over the life of the loan.  In addition to the lifetime caps and floors on rate adjustments, loans secured by residential real estate may contain provisions that limit annual increases at a maximum of 200 basis points.  There is usually no annual limit applied to loans secured by commercial real estate. Credit Risk:  Commercial lending and real estate construction lending, generally include a higher degree of credit risk than other loans, such as residential mortgage loans.  Commercial loans, like other loans, are evaluated at the time of approval to determine the adequacy of repayment sources and collateral requirements. Collateral requirements vary to some degree among borrowers and depend on the borrower's financial strength, the terms and amount of the loan, and collateral available to secure the loan.  Credit risk results from the decreased ability or willingness to pay by a borrower.  Credit risk also results when a liquidation of collateral occurs and there is a shortfall in collateral value as compared to a loan's outstanding balance.  For construction loans, inaccurate initial estimates of a project's costs and the property's completed value could weaken the Company's position and lead to the property having a value that is insufficient to satisfy full payment of the amount of funds advanced for the property.  Secured and unsecured consumer loans generally are made for automobiles, boats, and other motor vehicles.  In most cases, loans are restricted to Kentucky Bank's general market area. Other Products:  Kentucky Bank offers its customers a variety of other services, including checking, savings, money market accounts, certificates of deposits, safe deposit facilities, credit cards and other consumer-oriented financial services.  Kentucky Bank has Internet banking, including bill payment available to its customers at www.kybank.com.  Through its Wealth Management Department, Kentucky Bank provides brokerage services, annuities, life and long term care insurance, personal trust and agency services (including management agency services). 2 Competition and Market Served Competition:  The banking business is highly competitive.  Competition arises from a number of sources, including other bank holding companies and commercial banks, consumer finance companies, thrift institutions, other financial institutions and financial intermediaries.  In addition to commercial banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions actively compete to provide a wide variety of banking services.  Mortgage banking firms, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies, financial affiliates of industrial companies and government agencies provide additional competition for loans and for many other financial services.  Kentucky Bank also currently competes for interest-bearing funds with a number of other financial intermediaries, including brokerage firms and mutual funds, which offer a diverse range of investment alternatives.  Some of the Company's competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulatory review and restrictions that apply to the Company and its subsidiary bank.  In addition, the Company must compete with much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than the Company. Market Served.  We primarily conduct our business in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Our primary market areas consist of Bourbon, Clark, Elliott, Fayette, Harrison, Jessamine, Madison, Rowan, Scott, Woodford and surrounding counties in Kentucky.  Per capita personal income for Kentucky during the third quarter increased from $39,246 in 2016 to $39,536 in 2017, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate in Kentucky has declined. The unemployment rate in Kentucky is 4.4% for December of 2017, compared to 4.8% for December of 2016. Supervision and Regulation Governing Regulatory Institutions:  As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve Board.  The Company's subsidiary bank is subject to supervision and regulation by applicable state and federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions.  Kentucky Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered.  In addition to the impact of regulation, Kentucky Bank is affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.  The company also has a captive insurance subsidiary which is regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance. Laws Protecting Deposits:  There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy.  These obligations and restrictions are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insured funds in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or is in default.  For example, under a policy of the Federal Reserve Board with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.  In addition, the ""cross-guarantee"" provisions of federal law require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. The federal banking agencies also have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions.  The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are ""well capitalized"", ""adequately capitalized"", ""undercapitalized"", ""significantly undercapitalized"" or ""critically undercapitalized"", as such terms are defined under uniform regulation defining such capital levels issued by each of the federal banking agencies. Capital and Liquidity:  On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved final rules known as the ""Basel III Capital Rules"" substantially revising the risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions.  The Basel III Capital Rules address the components of capital and other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. Certain of the Basel III Capital Rules came into effect for the Company and Kentucky Bank on January 1, 2015; these rules are subject to a phase-in period which began on January 1, 2015. Under the current rules, which were effective January 1, 2015, the Company is subject to additional capital requirements that include: (i) creation of a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (""CET1"") capital, (ii) an increase to the minimum Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio, (iii) changes to risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, (iv) creation of an additional capital conservation buffer in excess of the required minimum capital ratios, and (v) changes to what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these capital requirements. 3 When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require banking organizations to maintain:  			 		 			 			a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% ""capital conservation buffer"" (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation);  			 		 			 			a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation);  			 		 			 			a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and  			 		 			 			a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a ""countercyclical capital buffer"" that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and is not expected to have any current applicability to the Company or Kentucky Bank. The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. The Basel III Capital Rules provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.  Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company and Kentucky Bank were given a one-time election (""Opt-out Election"") to filter certain accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") components, comparable to the treatment under the previous general risk-based capital rule. The Company and Kentucky Bank elected to choose the AOCI Opt-out Election. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and are being phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and is being phased-in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules revise the rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity. They establish a new framework under which mortgage-backed securities and other securitization exposures are subject to risk-weights ranging from 20% to 1,250%. The rules also establish adjusted risk-weights for credit exposures, including multi-family and commercial real estate exposures that are 90 days or more past due or on non-accrual, are subject to a 150% risk-weight, except in situations where qualifying collateral and/or guarantees are in place. The existing treatment of residential mortgage exposures will remain subject to either a 50% risk-weight (for prudently underwritten owner-occupied first liens that are current or less than 90 days past due) or a 100% risk-weight (for all other residential mortgage exposures including 90 days or more past due exposures).  As shown in Note 19, the Company and Kentucky Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements, and management does not anticipate any adverse impact from the implementation of the new capital ratio. Deposit Insurance:  The Company is subject to several deposit insurance assessments, which are described below: FDIC Assessments.  The Company's subsidiary bank is a member of the FDIC, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (""DIF"") up to the amount permitted by law.  The Company's subsidiary bank is thus subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments.  The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank's capital level and supervisory rating. The assessment base must, with some possible exceptions, equal average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.  The FDIC has adopted a DIF restoration plan to ensure that the reserve ratio increases to 1.35% from 1.15% of insured deposits by 2020. Financing Corporation (""FICO"") Assessments.  FICO assessment costs were $49 thousand in 2017, $50 thousand in 2016 and $47 thousand in 2015.  FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 possessing assessment powers in addition to the FDIC.  The FDIC acts as a collection agent for FICO, whose sole purpose is to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation.  Outstanding FICO bonds, which are 30-year noncallable bonds, mature in 2018 through 2019. 4 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (""Dodd-Frank Act""): The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law by the President on July 21, 2010, and represents a significant change in the American financial regulatory environment affecting all Federal financial regulatory agencies and affecting almost every aspect of the nation's financial services industry.  The Dodd-Frank Act includes, among others, the following:  			 		 			 			the creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Counsel to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation;  			 		 			 			the establishment of the same or strengthened capital and liquidity requirements for bank holding companies that apply to insured depository institutions;  			 		 			 			restrictions in proprietary trading and investing in or sponsoring of any hedge fund or private equity fund;  			 		 			 			the establishment of minimum credit risk retention requirements relating to securitizations;  			 		 			 			the establishment of detailed asset-level and data-level disclosure requirements relating to loan brokers and originators;  			 		 			 			codification and expansion of the ""source of strength"" doctrine as a statutory requirement.  The source of strength doctrine represents the long held policy view by the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks;  			 		 			 			a permanent increase of FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000;  			 		 			 			authorization for financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts;  			 		 			 			changes in the calculation of FDIC deposit insurance assessments;  			 		 			 			expanded restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and lending limits for derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions;  			 		 			 			provisions for new disclosure and other requirements regarding corporate governance and executive compensation;  			 		 			 			the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is authorized to promulgate consumer protection regulations relating to bank and non-bank financial products and examine and enforce these regulations on institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. On February 3, 2017 the President of the United States issued an executive order identifying certain ""core principles"" for the administration's financial services regulatory policy and directing the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other financial regulatory agencies, to evaluate how the current regulatory framework promotes or inhibits the principles and what actions have been, and are being, taken to promote the principles. In response to the executive order, on June 12, 2017, October 6, 2017 and October 26, 2017, respectively, the United States Department of the Treasury issued the first three of four reports recommending a number of comprehensive changes in the current regulatory system for U.S. depository institutions, the U.S. capital markets and the U.S. asset management and insurance industries, around the following principles.  			 		 			 			Improving regulatory efficiency and effectiveness by critically evaluating mandates and regulatory fragmentation, overlap, and duplication across regulatory agencies;  			 		 			 			Aligning the financial system to help support the U.S. economy;  			 		 			 			Reducing regulatory burden by decreasing unnecessary complexity;  			 		 			 			Tailoring the regulatory approach based on size and complexity of regulated firms and requiring greater regulatory cooperation and coordination among financial regulators; and  			 		 			 			Aligning regulations to support market liquidity, investment, and lending in the U.S. economy. The scope and breadth of regulatory changes that will be implemented in response to the President's executive order have not yet been determined.   Additionally, several of the requirements of Dodd-Frank still need to be implemented. Volcker Rule:  On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules that implement a part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the ""Volcker Rule.""  The Volcker Rule attempts to reduce risk and banking system instability by restricting U.S. banks from investing in or engaging in proprietary trading and speculation and imposing a strict framework to justify exemptions for underwriting, market making and hedging activities.  U.S. banks will be restricted from investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk.  The Volcker Rule has not had a significant effect on operations of the Company. Consumer Regulations:  In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above, Kentucky Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks.  While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act, among others.  These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients when taking deposits or making loans. These laws also limit Kentucky Bank's ability to share information with affiliated and unaffiliated entities.  The bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing business operations. 5 Dividend Restrictions:  There are various legal and regulatory limits on the extent to which the Company's subsidiary bank may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the Company.  In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies also have the authority to prevent a bank or bank holding company from paying a dividend or engaging in any other activity that, in the opinion of the agency, would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.  Dividends paid by the subsidiary bank have provided substantially all of the Company's operating funds, and this may reasonably be expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Employees At December 31, 2017, the number of full time equivalent employees of the Company was 233. Nature of Company's Business The business of the Company is not seasonal.  The Company's business does not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would have material adverse effect on the Company. No material portion of the Company's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any governmental entity. Available Information The Company files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The public may read and copy any material the Company files with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC  20549 and may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.  The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC on its website at www.sec.gov.  The Company's website is located at www.kybank.com.","Item 1A.  Risk Factors There are factors, many beyond our control, which may significantly affect the Company's financial position and results of operations.  Some of these factors are described below in the sections titled financial risk, business risk and operational risk.  These risks are not totally independent of each other; some factors affect more than one type of risk.  These include regulatory, economic, and competitive environments.  As part of the annual internal audit plan, our risk management department meets with management to assess these risks throughout the Company.  Many risks are further addressed in other sections of this Form 10-K document.  Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company's business operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. Industry Risk Industry risk includes risks that affect the entire banking service industry. Significant decline in general economic conditions will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.  Kentucky Bank serves both individuals and business customers throughout Central and Eastern Kentucky. The substantial majority of our loan portfolio is to individuals and businesses in these markets. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are affected by local and regional economic conditions. A downturn in these economies could have a negative impact on us and the ability of Kentucky Bank's customers to repay their loans. The value of the collateral securing loans to borrowers may also decline as the economy declines. As a result, deteriorating economic conditions in these markets could cause a decline in the overall quality of our loan portfolio requiring us to charge-off a higher percentage of loans and/or increase our allowance for loan losses. A decline in economic conditions in these markets may also force customers to utilize deposits held by Kentucky Bank in order to pay current expenses causing Kentucky Bank's deposit base to shrink. As a result Kentucky Bank may have to borrow funds at higher rates in order to meet liquidity needs. These events may have a negative impact on our earnings and financial condition. Significant declines in U.S. and global markets could have a negative impact on our earnings. The capital and credit markets could experience extreme disruption. These conditions result in less liquidity, greater volatility, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain asset types. In many cases, markets could exert downward pressure on stock prices, security prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. Sustained weakness in business and economic conditions in any or all of the domestic or foreign financial markets could result in credit deterioration in investment securities held by us, rating agency downgrades for such securities or other market factors that (such as lack of liquidity for re-sales, absence of reliable pricing information or unanticipated changes in the competitive market) could result in us having to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in the value of such investment securities, with a corresponding charge against earnings.  If the markets deteriorate further, these conditions may be material to our ability to access capital and may adversely impact results of operations. 6 Further, Kentucky Bank's trust and investment services income could be impacted by fluctuations in the securities market. A portion of this revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios. If the values of those investment portfolios decline, Kentucky Bank's revenue could be negatively impacted. The exercise of regulatory power may have negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, rather than corporate shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth, among other things. These regulations also impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedure and controls. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products that could be offered, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. Regulation of the Company and our subsidiaries is expected to continue to expand in scope and complexity in the future. These laws are expected to have the effect of increasing our costs of doing business and reducing our revenues, and may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act and other laws, as well as rules implementing or related to them, may adversely affect us. Specifically, any governmental or regulatory action having the effect of requiring us to obtain additional capital could reduce earnings and have a material dilutive effect on current shareholders, including the Dodd-Frank Act source of strength requirement that bank holding companies make capital infusions into a troubled subsidiary bank. Legislation and regulation of debit card fees, credit cards and other bank services, as well as changes in our practices relating to those and other bank services, may affect our revenue and other financial results. Additional information about increased regulation is provided in ""Item 1. Business"" under the heading ""Supervision and Regulation."" We are also subject to tax laws and regulations promulgated by the United States government and the states in which it operates. Changes to these laws and regulations or the interpretations of such laws and regulations by taxing authorities could impact future tax expense and the value of deferred tax assets. A new accounting standard will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued an accounting standard update, ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,"" which replaces the current ""incurred loss"" model for recognizing credit losses with an ""expected loss"" model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (""CECL"") model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the ""incurred loss"" model required under current generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The new CECL standard will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, consistent with regulatory expectations set forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of 2016. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations. Deposit insurance premiums levied against the Company may increase if the number of bank failures increase or the cost of resolving failed banks increases.  The FDIC maintains a DIF to protect insured depositors in the event of bank failures. The DIF is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions including Kentucky Bank.  Future deposit premiums paid by Kentucky Bank depend on the level of the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures. Kentucky Bank may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums if market developments change such that the DIF balance is reduced. Increased competition from other providers may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  We face vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions.  This competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services, reduce market share and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition. 7 Many other banks and financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits, larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services.  Additionally, we encounter competition from both de novo and smaller community banks entering the markets we are currently in.  We also compete with other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies and insurance companies. Changes in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our financial results.  Technology and other changes now allow many consumers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank and can access loans through lending groups and other non-regulated entities. This ""disintermediation"" could result in the loss of fee and interest income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our operations, and we may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes that are accepted by new and existing customers. Financial Risk Financial risk components include, but are not limited to, credit risk, interest rate risk, goodwill impairment, market risk and liquidity risk.  We have adopted various policies to minimize potential adverse effects of interest rate, market and liquidity risks.  However, even with these policies in place, a change in interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations or financial position. Defaults in the repayment of loans may negatively impact our business.  Credit risk is most closely associated with lending activities at financial institutions.  Credit risk is the risk to earnings and capital when a customer fails to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise fails to perform as agreed.  Credit risk arises from all activities where the Company is dependent on issuer, borrower, or counterparty performance, not just traditional lending activities.  For example, the investment security portfolio has inherent credit risk as do counterparties in derivative contracts.  Credit risk encompasses a broad range of financial institution activities and includes items reflected both on and off the balance sheet. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for repayment of many of the loans.  In determining the size of the allowance for loan losses, management considers, among other factors, the Company's loan loss experience and an evaluation of economic conditions.  If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, the current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio.  Material additions to the Company's allowance would materially decrease our net income. Fluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact our banking business.  Interest rate risk focuses on the impact to earnings and capital arising from movements in interest rates.  Interest rate risk focuses on the value implications for accrual portfolios (e.g., available-for-sale portfolios) and includes the potential impact to the Company's accrual earnings as well as the economic perspective of the market value of portfolio equity.  The interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk.  Repricing risk represents the risk associated with the differences in timing of cash flows and rate changes with our products.  Basis risk represents the risk associated with changing rate relationships among varying yield curves.  Yield curve risk is associated with changing rate relationships over the maturity structure.  Options risk is associated with interest-related options, which are embedded in our products. Changes in market multiples may negatively affect the value of Goodwill.  Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired.  Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.  Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually.  The Company has selected December 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test.  Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.  Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet.  At a minimum, management is required to assess goodwill and other intangible assets annually for impairment.  This assessment involves estimating cash flows for future periods, preparing analyses of market multiples for similar operations, and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is allocated.  If these variables change negatively, the Company would be required to take a charge against earnings to write down the asset to the lower fair value. Changes in market factors may negatively affect the value of our investment assets.  Market risk focuses on the impact to earnings and capital arising from changes in market factors (e.g., interest rates, market liquidity, volatilities, etc.) that affect the value of traded instruments.  Market risk includes items reflected both on and off the balance sheet.  Market risk focuses primarily on mark-to-market portfolios (e.g., accounts revalued for financial statement presentation). 8 Our inability to maintain appropriate levels of liquidity may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Liquidity risk focuses on the impact to earnings and capital resulting from our inability to meet our obligations as they become due in the normal course of business without incurring significant losses.  It also includes the management of unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources as well as managing changes in market conditions, which could affect the ability to liquidate assets in the normal course of business without incurring significant losses.  Liquidity risk includes items both on and off the balance sheet. Our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected if we are unable to meet a debt covenant and, correspondingly, unable to obtain a waiver regarding the debt covenant from the lender.  From time to time we may obtain financing from other lenders.  The loan documents reflecting the financing often require us to meet various debt covenants.  If we are unable to meet one or more of our debt covenants, then we will typically attempt to obtain a waiver from the lender.  If the lender does not agree to a waiver, then we will be in default under our borrowing obligation.  This default could affect our ability to fund various strategies that we may have implemented resulting in a negative impact in our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.  In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. While we will take steps to mitigate this risk, we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at one or more properties. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, while there are certain statutory protections afforded lenders who take title to property through foreclosure on a loan, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Business Risk Business risk is composed mainly of legal (compliance) risk, strategic risk and reputation risk. Our results of operations and financial condition are susceptible to legal or compliance risks.  Legal or compliance risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from the impact of unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, adverse judgments, violations or nonconformance with laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards.  The risk also arises in situations where laws or rules governing certain products or activities of our customers may be ambiguous or untested.  This risk is not limited to the traditional thinking that legal/compliance risk is only associated with consumer protection laws.  It includes the exposure to litigation from all aspects of both traditional and nontraditional financial institution activities. Incorrect strategic decisions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Adverse publicity may have a negative impact on our business.  Reputation risk is the risk to earnings and capital arising from negative public opinion.  This affects the ability to establish new relationships or services or to continue servicing existing relationships.  Examiners will assess reputation risk by recognizing the potential effect the public's opinion could have on our franchise value. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may impact our business in unforeseen ways. On December 22, 2017, legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Reform""), was signed into law. The Tax Reform, among other changes, reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The enactment of the Tax Reform will significantly impact the manner in which we determine our federal income tax and may have unforeseen consequences. The Tax Reform is the first major overhaul of U.S. corporate taxation in almost 20 years with both positive and negative impacts on our business. The positive impacts include reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and accelerating the recovery period of the Company's fixed assets. These positive impacts are offset by new tax provisions intended to expand the federal tax base by disallowing certain expenses that were previously deductible (i.e. 50% of entertainment expenses, deductions for certain senior management compensation, etc.). It is difficult to determine the overall impact on our business, but it appears that the Company will have a net savings in its federal income tax liability. The impact of the Tax Reform may also have significant impact on our clients and their future behavior in light of the new tax rates applicable to individuals, trusts and unincorporated businesses. The limitation on the deductibility of state and local taxes and real estate taxes for individuals may result in clients moving to lower tax states where we do not have operations Operational Risk Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.  Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. 9 In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation. Technology Risk Systems failure, interruption or breach of security may have a negative impact on our business.  Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of Kentucky Bank's business, as such systems are used to manage customer relationships, deposits, loans, general ledger accounts, financial reporting and regulatory compliance.  While Kentucky Bank has established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions, and security breaches, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, any compromise of Kentucky Bank's information security systems could deter customers from using Kentucky Bank's web site and its internet banking service, both of which involve the transmission of confidential information. Although Kentucky Bank relies on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to ensure the secure transmission and processing of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from all compromises or breaches of security. The business continuity of third-party providers may have a negative impact on our technology operations.  Kentucky Bank outsources certain of its data processing to third-party providers.  If third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if the Bank has difficulty communicating with them, Kentucky Bank's ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and its business operations could be adversely impacted.  Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. We and our subsidiary bank have addressed technology risks through the use of logon and user access controls, transaction limits, firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion protection monitoring and third party vulnerability scans.  Systems failure or interruption has been addressed by adopting a disaster recovery and contingency plan.  In addition, for all third-party providers of data processing services, we obtain and review audit reports prepared by independent registered public accounting firms regarding their financial condition and the effectiveness of their internal controls.","Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis This section presents an analysis of the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kentucky Bank, at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2017.  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8.  When necessary, reclassifications have been made to prior years' data throughout the following discussion and analysis for purposes of comparability with 2017 data. Critical Accounting Policies Overview.  The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiary are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry.  Significant accounting policies are listed in Note 1 of the Company's 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8.  Critical accounting and reporting policies include accounting for loans and the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and fair value.  Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Loan Values and Allowance for Loan Losses.  Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by an allowance for loan losses.  Interest on loans is recognized on the accrual basis, except for those loans on the nonaccrual status.  Interest income received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method.  The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses.  Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors.  The accounting policies relating to the allowance for loan losses involve the use of estimates and require significant judgments to be made by management.  The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset group on the consolidated balance sheets.  Additional information related to the allowance for loan losses that describes the methodology and risk factors can be found under the captions ""Asset Quality"" and ""Loan Losses"" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation, as well as Notes 1 and 4 of the Company's 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. Goodwill.    Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually.  The Company has selected December 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test.  Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet. Fair Values.  Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in the description of each asset and liability category in Note 17 of the Company's 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes.  Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.  Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates. Forward-Looking Statements This discussion contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties.  Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:  economic conditions (both generally and more specifically in the markets, including the tobacco market, the thoroughbred horse industry and the automobile industry relating to Toyota vehicles, in which the Company and its bank operate); competition for the Company's customers from other providers of financial and mortgage services; government legislation, regulation and monetary policy (which changes from time to time and over which the Company has no control); changes in interest rates (both generally and more specifically mortgage interest rates); material unforeseen changes in the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company's customers; and other risks detailed in Part 1, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this report and other risks detailed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company.  The Company undertakes no obligation to republish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Overview We conduct our business through our one bank subsidiary, Kentucky Bank, and our one non-bank subsidiary KBI Insurance Company.  Kentucky Bank is engaged in general full-service commercial and consumer banking.  A significant part of Kentucky Bank's operating activities include originating loans, approximately 81% of which are secured by real estate at December 31, 2017. 15 Kentucky Bank makes commercial, agricultural and real estate loans to its commercial customers, with emphasis on small-to-medium-sized industrial, service and agricultural businesses.  It also makes residential mortgages, installment and other loans to its individual and other non-commercial customers.  Kentucky Bank's primary market is Bourbon, Clark, Elliott, Fayette, Harrison, Jessamine, Madison, Rowan, Scott, Woodford and surrounding counties in Kentucky.  KBI Insurance Company is a captive insurance subsidiary and was incorporated in 2014. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $10.7 million, or $3.61 per common share compared to $8.6 million, or $2.87 for 2016 and $6.8 million, or $2.40 for 2015.  Earnings per share assuming dilution were $3.61, $2.87 and $2.40 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For 2017, net income increased $2.1 million, or 25.1%.  Net interest income increased $1.5 million, provision for loan losses decreased $650 thousand, total other income increased $1.7 million, while total other expenses decreased $712 thousand and income tax expense increased $2.4 million. For 2016, net income increased $1.7 million, or 25.4%.  Net interest income increased $3.0 million, the provision for loan losses decreased $300 thousand, total other income increased $665 thousand, while total other expenses increased $2.0 million and income tax expense increased $243 thousand. Return on average equity was 10.9% in 2017 compared to 9.1% in 2016 and 8.2% in 2015.  Return on average assets was 1.04% in 2017 compared to 0.86% in 2016 and 0.76% in 2015. Non-performing loans as a percentage of loans (including held for sale) were 0.22%, 1.15% and 1.54% as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Interest Income Net interest income, the Company's largest source of revenue, on a tax equivalent basis increased from $30.9 million in 2015 to $34.0 million in 2016, and to $35.4 million in 2017.  The taxable equivalent adjustment (nontaxable interest income on state and municipal obligations net of the related non-deductible portion of interest expense) is based on our Federal income tax rate of 34%. Average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities both increased from 2016 to 2017.  Average earning assets increased $39.6 million, or 4.2%.  Average investment securities increased $32.0 million and average loans increased $4.1 million.  Average interest bearing liabilities increased $19.6 million, or 2.8% during this same period.  Average borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $2.7 million, or 2.9%.  The Company continues to actively pursue quality loans and fund these primarily with deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  Average Repurchase agreements and other borrowings decreased $1.2 million or 3.5% from 2016 to 2017. The bank prime rates increased 75 basis points from December 2016 to December 2017.  The tax equivalent yield on earning assets increased from 4.07% in 2016 to 4.11% in 2017. The volume rate analysis for 2017 that follows indicates that $985 thousand of the increase in interest income is attributable to an increase in volume, while the change in rates contributed to an increase of $1.1 million in interest income.  Further, an increase in interest bearing liabilities resulted in $35 thousand additional interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 while changes in rates resulted in additional interest expense of $553 thousand over the same period.  The average rate of these liabilities increased from 0.64% in 2016 to 0.70% in 2017.  In summary, the increase in the Company's 2017 net interest income is attributed mostly to increases in rates for interest earning assets and an increase in balances in our security portfolio. The volume rate analysis for 2016 that follows indicates that $3.8 million of the increase in interest income is attributable to an increase in volume, while the change in rates contributed to a decrease of $460 thousand in interest income.  Further, an increase in interest bearing liabilities resulted in $375 thousand additional interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015.  The average rate of these liabilities decreased from 0.66% in 2015 to 0.64% in 2016.  In summary, the increase in the Company's 2016 net interest income is attributed mostly to an increase in volume in the loan and security portfolios. The accompanying analysis of changes in net interest income in the following table shows the relationships of the volume and rate portions of these changes in 2017 vs. 2016 and 2016 vs. 2015.  Changes in interest income and expenses due to both rate and volume are allocated on a pro rata basis. 16 Changes in Interest Income and Expense (in thousands)

In 2017, reductions in gains on available for sale securities and gains on the sale of loans were offset by gains in service charges, loan servicing fee income, debit card interchange income and a one-time gain on the sale of a bank building.  In 2016, reductions in net loan servicing fee income, gains on available for sale securities and other income were offset by gains in service charges, gains on the sale of loans and debit card interchange income.  In 2015, reductions in gains on securities available for sale and gains on the trading account were offset by increases in gains on sold mortgage loans, debit card interchange income, service charges and loan servicing fee income. Securities gains were $52 thousand in 2017, $287 thousand in 2016 and $412 thousand in 2015.  These gains are primarily attributed to selling securities which had gains in market value due to declining interest rates and the related inverse relationship of interest rates and market values. Gains on loans sold were $1.7 million, $2.1 million and $1.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Loans held for sale are generally sold after closing to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or other government agencies.  During 2017, the loan servicing fee income, net of amortization expense for the mortgage servicing right asset, increased $244 thousand, compared to a decrease of $135 thousand in 2016.  In 2017, the mortgage servicing right asset had net recoveries of prior write-downs of $69 thousand compared to net write-downs of $105 thousand in the valuation allowance in 2016.  Proceeds from the sale of loans were $58 million, $64 million and $51 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The volume of loan originations is inverse to rate changes with historic low rates spurring activity.  The volume of loan originations during 2017 was $57 million, $62 million in 2016, and $49 million in 2015. Other noninterest income, excluding net security gains, the sale of mortgage loans and a one-time gain of $1.2 million for the sale of a building in 2017, was $10.8 million in 2017, $9.8 million in 2016 and $9.6 million in 2015.  Service charge income, and more particularly overdraft income, is the largest contributor to these numbers.  Overdraft income was $2.6 million in 2017, $2.7 million in 2016 and $2.6 million in 2015.  Debit card interchange income was the second largest contributor to noninterest income, excluding security gains and gains on the sale of mortgage loans.  Debit card interchange income was $3.0 million in 2017, $2.7 million in 2016 and $2.5 million in 2015.  Other income was $349 thousand in 2017, $95 thousand in 2016 and $849 thousand in 2015.  Other income was lower in 2016 due to the bank recording a loss of $335 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2016  for the write-off of bank premises and equipment associated with a branch building that was to be demolished so a new branch building could be rebuilt.  In addition, during 2015, other income was higher due to the Bank recording an additional $768 thousand in income for restitution received for a legal dispute. Noninterest expense decreased $712 thousand in 2017 to $33.1 million, and increased $2.0 million in 2016 to $33.8 million from $31.8 million in 2015. Salaries and benefits, the largest contributor to total non-interest expense, increased $72 thousand from $17.9 million in 2016 to $18.0 million in 2017 due to normal staff merit increases.  Full-time equivalent employees decreased from 241 at December 31, 2016 to 233 at December 31, 2017. The largest component of occupancy expense, depreciation expense, decreased $104 thousand to $1.2 million in 2017, and decreased $92 thousand to $1.3 million in 2016.  Building rent expense, included in occupancy expense, increased $95 thousand from 2016 to 2017, mostly due to temporarily leasing back a bank building in Winchester, KY which was sold during the first quarter of 2017.  The Company will lease back this building until construction is complete on a new branch in downtown Winchester, KY.  The anticipated completion date of the new building is mid-year 2018. Other noninterest expenses increased from $11.4 million in 2015 to $12.1 million in 2016 and decreased to $11.3 million in 2017.   Legal and professional fees decreased $546 thousand from $1.6 million in 2016 to $1.1 million in 2017.  Legal and professional fees were higher in 2016 due to additional costs related to utilizing additional outside consulting services.  Expenses incurred during 2015 for the acquisition of Madison Financial Corporation totaled $858 thousand.

In making these investments, the Company considers the overall impact to managing our net interest margin, credit worthiness of the underlying issuer and the favorable impact on our tax position.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company averaged $81.1 million in tax free securities, $2.5 million in tax free trading assets and $39.3 million in tax free loans.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company averaged $84.3 million in tax free securities, $5.6 million in tax free trading assets and $38.0 million in tax free loans.  As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average remaining maturity for the tax free securities is 119 months, while the weighted average remaining maturity for the tax free loans is 139 months. The Company had income tax expense of $3.2 million in 2017, $773 thousand in 2016 and $530 thousand in 2015.  This represents an effective income tax rate of 22.8% in 2017, 8.3% in 2016 and 7.1% in 2015.  The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate of 34% is primarily due to tax exempt income on certain investment securities and loans.  On December 22, 2017, the 'Tax Cuts and Jobs Act' was enacted into legislation. Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an estimated $443 thousand for the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets to estimate the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the lowering of the federal corporate tax rate to 21%,   In addition, the Company had additional tax credits which also contributed to the lower effective income tax rate for those years.  In 2017, the Company had tax credits totaling $555 thousand for investments made in low income housing projects which represented a decrease of $327 thousand compared to similar tax credits in 2016. Balance Sheet Review Assets increased from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017.  Securities available for sale increased $44 million during 2017, outstanding loan balances decreased $7.5 million during 2017 and deposits increased $12 million during 2017.  Assets at year-end 2016 totaled $1 billion compared to $974 million in 2015.  Securities available for sale increased $10 million, outstanding loan balances increased $32 million and deposits increased $44 million compared to 2015. 20 On July 24, 2015, the Company acquired Madison Financial Corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary Madison Bank.  At the acquisition date, acquired securities available for sale totaled $28 million, acquired loan balances totaled $78 million and acquired deposit balances totaled $96 million.  Total acquired assets totaled $116 million at the acquisition date. Loans Total loans (including loans held for sale) were $650 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $657 million at December 31, 2016 and $625 million at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in the loan portfolio during 2017 is attributed to increased competition.  As of December 31, 2017 and compared to the prior year-end, commercial loans increased $2.6 million, real estate construction loans decreased $8.4 million, 1-4 family residential property loans decreased $6.0 million, multi-family residential property loans decreased $7.3 million, non-farm & non-residential property loans increased $16.1 million, agricultural loans decreased $3.3 million and consumer loans and other loans decreased $698 thousand.

As of both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the real estate mortgage portfolio comprised 81% of total loans. Of this, 1-4 family residential property represented 37% both in  2017 and 2016.  Agricultural loans comprised 9% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 10% at December 31, 2016. Approximately 88% of the agricultural loans are secured by real estate at December 31, 2017 and 87% at December 31, 2016.  The remainder of the agricultural portfolio is used to purchase livestock, equipment and other capital improvements and for general operation of the farm.  Generally, a secured interest is obtained in the capital assets, equipment, livestock or crops. Automobile loans account for 18%, in 2017 and 23% in 2016, of the consumer loan portfolio, while the purpose of the remainder of this portfolio is used by customers for purchasing retail goods, home improvement or other personal reasons.  The commercial loan portfolio is mainly for capital outlays and business operation. Collateral is requested depending on the creditworthiness of the borrower.  Unsecured loans are made to individuals or companies mainly based on the creditworthiness of the customer.  Approximately 7% of the loan portfolio is unsecured.  Management is not aware of any significant concentrations that may cause future material risks, which may result in significant problems with future income and capital requirements. 21 The following table represents a summary of the Company's loan portfolio by category for each of the last five years.  There is no concentration of loans (greater than 5% of the loan portfolio) in any industry.  The Company has no foreign loans or highly leveraged transactions in its loan portfolio.

The activity in origination and sale of these loans fluctuates, mainly due to changes in interest rates.  Mortgage loan originations increased from $49 million in 2015 to $62 million in 2016, and decreased to $57 million in 2017.  Proceeds from the sale of loans were $51 million, $64 million and $58 million for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.  Mortgage loans held for sale were $1.2 million at December 31, 2017 and $724 thousand at December 31, 2016.  Fixed rate residential mortgage loans are generally sold when they are made.  The volume of loan originations is inverse to rate changes.  During 2017, rising mortgage rates and fewer consumers refinancing mortgages resulted in the Bank originating fewer mortgage loans when compared to 2016 but still more than 2015 due to the Madison Bank acquisition in 2015.  The effect of these changes was also reflected on the income statement.  As a result, the gain on sale of loans was $1.7 million in 2017 compared to $2.1 million in 2016 and $1.5 million in 2015. 22 The Bank has sold various loans to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) while retaining the servicing rights.  Gains and losses on loan sales are recorded at the time of the cash sale, which represents the premium or discount paid by the FHLMC and FHLB.  The Bank receives a servicing fee from the FHLMC and FHLB on each loan sold.  Servicing rights are carried using the amortized cost method and are capitalized based on the relative fair value of the rights and the expected life of the loan and are expensed in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. Mortgage servicing rights were $1.5 million at December 31, 2017, $1.3 million at December 31, 2016 and $1.3 million at December 31, 2015. Amortization of mortgage servicing rights was $246 thousand (including $69 thousand for positive fair value adjustments), $439 thousand (including $105 thousand for negative fair value adjustments) and $280 thousand (including $59 thousand for negative fair value adjustments) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  See Note 4 in the Company's 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 for additional information. Deposits For 2017, total deposits increased $12 million to $815 million.  Noninterest bearing deposits increased $11 million, time deposits of $250 thousand and over increased $5 million, and other interest bearing deposits decreased $4 million.  Public fund balances totaled $192 million at December 31, 2017, of which $187 million was interest bearing. For 2016, total deposits increased $44 million to $803 million.  Noninterest bearing deposits increased $10 million, time deposits of $250 thousand and over increased $13 million, and other interest bearing deposits increased $21 million.  Public fund balances totaled $190 million at December 31, 2016, of which $190 million was interest bearing.

Long-term borrowing at the Bank is primarily from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB).  This borrowing is mainly used to fund longer term, fixed rate mortgages, as part of a leverage strategy and to assist in asset/liability management.  Advances are either paid monthly or at maturity.  As of December 31, 2017, $99 million was borrowed from FHLB, an increase of $6 million from December 31, 2016. Throughout 2017, the Bank had a net increase of $8.4 million in short-term borrowings from the FHLB which were outstanding at December 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2016, no short-term borrowings from the FHLB were outstanding.  FHLB advances classified as short-term have an original maturity of less than 1 year.  Also, during 2017, the Bank borrowed $13.0 million in longer-term advances and repaid $15.2 million in long term advances.  These advances each had an original maturity of more than 1 year. Throughout 2016, the Bank borrowed and repaid $138.5 million in short-term funds from the FHLB.  As of December 31, 2016, no short-term borrowings from the FHLB were outstanding.  Also, during 2016, the Bank borrowed $15.0 million in longer-term advances and repaid $10.3 million in long term advances.  Those advances each had an original maturity of more than 1 year. On July 20, 2015, the Company borrowed $5.0 million which had an outstanding balance of $3.3 million at December 31, 2017.  The term loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.0%, requires quarterly principal and interest payments, matures July 20, 2025 and is collateralized by Kentucky Bank stock.  Additional information pertaining to the note payable may be found in Note 10 of the financial statements. 23 The following table depicts relevant information concerning our short term borrowings.

These categories include:  loans that are currently nonperforming, other real estate, and loans that are currently performing but which management believes require special attention. During periods of economic slowdown, the Company may experience an increase in nonperforming loans. The Company discontinues the accrual of interest on loans that become 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless reasons for delinquency are documented such as the loan being well collateralized and in the process of collection.  A loan remains in a non-accrual status until factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist.  A loan is classified as a restructured loan when the interest rate is materially reduced or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date because of the inability of the borrower to service the interest payments at market rates.

The decrease from 2016 to 2017 is mostly attributed to decreases in non-accrual loan balances and restructured loans.  The decrease from 2015 to 2016 is attributed to decreases in non-accrual loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and other real estate.  Total other real estate properties totaled $2.4 million at December 31, 2017, of which, $955 thousand were income producing property.  Total nonperforming loans were $1.4 million, $7.6 million, and 9.6 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease in restructured loans during 2017 is attributed to restructured loans with a balance at December 31, 2016 paying off during 2017.  Total net loan charge offs in 2017 were $321thousand.  The amount of lost interest on our non-accrual loans was $46 thousand for 2017 and $109 thousand for 2016.  At December 31, 2017, loans currently performing but which management believes requires special attention were $18.7 million, with 39% being non-farm and non-residential, 20% being agriculturual, 19% being 1-4 family residential, 13% being multi-family and 9% being commercial.  The Company continues to follow its long-standing policy of not engaging in international lending and not concentrating lending activity in any one industry. The carrying amount of impaired loans as of December 31, 2017 was $183 thousand compared to $3.9 million as of December 31, 2016.  The carrying amount of purchased credit impaired loans totaled $1.6 million at December 31, 2017 and $1.9 million at December 31, 2016.  These amounts are generally included in the total nonperforming and restructured loans presented in the table above.  See Note 17 in the Company's 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 herein. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  All amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest payments and the contractual principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement. Nonaccrual loans are loans for which payments in full of principal or interest is not expected or which principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection.  Impaired loans may be loans showing signs of weakness or interruptions in cash flow, but ultimately are current or less than 90 days past due with respect to principal and interest and for which we anticipate full payment of principal and interest through collateral liquidation. Additional factors considered by management in determining impairment and non-accrual status include payment status, collateral value, availability of current financial information, and the probability of collecting all contractual principal and interest payments. At December 31, 2017, loans individually evaluated for impairment totaled $1.6 million.  Of this, $206 thousand in balances had specific impairment allocations of $23 thousand.  The remaining $1.4 million in impaired loan balances did not have a specific impairment allocation.  The purchased credit impaired loans the Company had at December 31, 2017 had no allocated reserves. 25 At December 31, 2016, impaired loan balances totaled $6.5 million and had specific impairment allocations of $541 thousand.  An additional $1.5 million in loan balances was individually for impairment but resulted in no specific impairment allocation.  The purchased credit impaired loans the Company had at December 31, 2016 had no allocated reserves. The allowance for loan losses on impaired loans is determined using one of two methods.  Either the present value of estimated future cash flows of the loan, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral.  The entire change in present value of expected cash flows is reported as a provision for loan losses in the same manner in which impairment initially was recognized or as a reduction in the amount of provision for loan losses that otherwise would be reported.  The total allowance for loan losses related to these loans was $23 thousand, $541 thousand and $648 thousand on December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Kentucky Bank has a ""Problem Loan Committee"" that meets at least monthly to review problem loans, including past due and non-performing loans, and other real estate.  When analyzing the problem loans and the loan quality as of December 31, 2017, the following factors have been considered:  			 		 			 			Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses.  			 		 			 			Change in international, national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments.  			 		 			 			Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans.  			 		 			 			Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff.  			 		 			 			Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans; the volume of non-accrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans.  			 		 			 			Changes in the quality of the Bank's loan review system.  			 		 			 			Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans.  			 		 			 			The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.  			 		 			 			The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the Bank's existing portfolio. 26 Loan Losses The following table is a summary of the Company's loan loss experience for each of the past five years.

considered doubtful, and would be well documented and approved by the appropriate responsible party or committee.  The provision for loan losses for 2017 was $500 thousand compared to $1.2 million in 2016 and $1.5 million in 2015.  Net charge-offs were $321 thousand in 2017, $130 thousand in 2016 and $941 thousand in 2015.  Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.05%, 0.02% and 0.16% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The provision for loan losses decreased $600 thousand from 2016 to 2017 and decreased $300 thousand from 2015 to 2016.  The allowance for loan losses increased $179 thousand from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. In evaluating the allowance for loan losses, management considers the composition of the loan portfolio, the historical loan loss experience, the overall quality of the loans and an assessment of current economic conditions.  At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was 1.19% of loans outstanding compared to 1.15% at year-end 2016 and 1.04% at year-end 2015.  Management believes the allowance for loan losses at the year-end 2017 is adequate to cover probable incurred credit losses within the portfolio. 27 The following tables set forth an allocation for the allowance for loan losses and loans by category.  In making the allocation, management evaluates the risk in each category, current economic conditions and charge-off experience.  An allocation for the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the portion of the allowance that represents probable incurred losses in each loan category, but it does not preclude any portion of the allowance allocated to one type of loan being used to absorb losses of another loan type.

instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs.  These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates.  Commitments may expire without being used.  Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated.  The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk were as follows at year-end (in thousands): 2017 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2016 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Unused lines of credit 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 98,413 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 102,088 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Commitments to make loans 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 17,249 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 29,566 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Letters of credit 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 672 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 463 Unused lines of credit are substantially all at variable rates.

Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, was $101.3 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $93.9 million at December 31, 2016.  Included in Tier I capital is $7 million of trust preferred securities issued in August 2003.  The disallowed amount of stockholders' equity is mainly attributable to the goodwill and/or core deposit intangibles, resulting from the Kentucky First acquisition in 2003, the Peoples Bank acquisition in 2006 and the Madison Financial Corporation acquisition in 2015.  The Company's risk-based capital and leverage ratios, as shown in the following table, exceeded the levels required to be considered ""well capitalized"".  The leverage ratio compares Tier I capital to total average assets less disallowed amounts of goodwill.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (""FDICIA"") established five capital categories for insured depository institutions under its Prompt Corrective Action Provisions.  The bank regulatory agencies adopted regulations, which became effective in 1992, defining these five capital categories for banks they regulate.  The categories vary from ""well capitalized"" to ""critically undercapitalized"".  A ""well capitalized"" bank is defined as one with a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, a leverage ratio of 5% or more, and one not subject to any order, written agreement, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet or maintain a specific capital level.  At December 31, 2017, the bank had ratios that exceeded the minimum requirements established for the ""well capitalized"" category. In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that will revise their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method of calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain ""available-for-sale"" securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirement unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised. The rule limits a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a ""capital conservation buffer"" consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and will end January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective. 29 In management's opinion, there are no other known trends, events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's liquidity, capital resources or operations. Securities and Federal Funds Sold Securities, classified as available for sale, increased from $273.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $318.2 million at December 31, 2017.   Federal funds sold totaled $321 thousand at December 31, 2017 and $1.2 million at December 31, 2016.  Trading assets, not included in securities available for sale, totaled $0 at December 31, 2017 compared to $5.6 million at December 31, 2016.  The decrease in trading assets is attributed to liquidating our trading asset portfolio during December 2017. Per Company policy, fixed rate asset backed securities will not have an average life exceeding seven years, but final maturity may be longer.  Adjustable rate securities shall adjust within three years per Company policy.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held $11 million and $6 in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities.  Unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities are temporary and change inversely with movements in interest rates.  In addition, some prepayment risk exists on mortgage-backed securities and prepayments are likely to increase with decreases in interest rates.  The following tables present the investment securities for each of the past three years and the maturity and yield characteristics of securities as of December 31, 2017.

Therefore, the Company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets and inventories.  However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and the resulting need 30 to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio.  Inflation also affects other expenses, which tend to rise during periods of inflation.","Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates.  Management considers interest rate risk and liquidity risk to be significant market risks to the Company, but considers interest risk to be the most significant. Kentucky Bank's Asset/Liability Committee oversees the Company's interest rate risk and liquidity risks.  The Bank has developed procedures designed to ensure safety and soundness, maintain liquidity and regulatory capital standards, and achieve acceptable net interest income.  The exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Asset/Liability Committee. Interest Rate Risk.  Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes.  These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values.  The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximize income. Management realizes certain risks are inherent and that the goal is to identify and minimize the risks.  The primary tool used by management is an interest rate shock simulation model. Certain assumptions, such as prepayment risks, are included in the model.  However, actual prepayments may differ from those assumptions.  In addition, immediate withdrawal of interest checking and other savings accounts may have an effect on the results of the model. The following table depicts the change in net interest income resulting from 100 and 300 basis point changes in rates.  The projections are based on balance sheet growth assumptions and repricing opportunities for new, maturing and adjustable rate amounts.  In addition, the projected percentage changes from level rates are outlined below along with the Board of Directors approved limits.  As of December 31, 2017 the projected net interest income percentages are within the Board of Directors limits.  Please note that in the current low interest rate environment, many rates cannot decline 100 basis points.  Therefore, the projected net interest income changes below as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 for a declining rate environment are not as relevant.

In 2017, year one reflected a 0.3% increase in projected net interest income compared to a 0.2% projected decrease in 2016 with a 100 basis point increase.  The 300 basis point increase in rates reflected a 0.4% increase in net interest income in 2017 and a 0.5% decrease in 2016.  The 100 point decrease in rates reflected a 2.4% decrease in net interest income in 2017 compared to a 1.7% decrease in 2016. Management measures the Company's interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in net interest income in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates.  The Company's exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and quarterly with the Board of Directors. Exposure to interest rate risk is measured with the use of interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates, while interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the Company's assets and liabilities.  If estimated changes to net interest income are not within the limits established by the Board, the Board may direct management to adjust the Company's asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within Board approved limits. Liquidity Risk.  Liquidity risk is the possibility that the Company may not be able to meet its cash requirements.  Management of liquidity risk includes maintenance of adequate cash and sources of cash to fund operations and meet the needs of borrowers, depositors and creditors.  Excess liquidity generally has a negative impact on earnings resulting from the lower yields on short-term assets. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the securities portfolio provides an important source of liquidity.  Total securities maturing within one year along with cash and cash equivalents totaled $42.2 million at December 31, 2017.  Additionally, securities available-for-sale with maturities greater than one year and mortgage-backed and equity securities totaled $315.2 million at December 31, 2017.  The available for sale securities are available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis. The Company maintains a relatively stable base of customer deposits and its steady growth is expected to be adequate to meet its funding demands.  In addition, management believes the majority of its $100,000 or more certificates of deposit are no more volatile than its core deposits.  At December 31, 2017 these balances totaled $123.2 million, approximately 15% of total deposits. The Company also relies on Federal Home Loan Bank advances for both liquidity and asset/liability management purposes.  These advances are used primarily to fund long-term fixed rate residential mortgage loans.  We have sufficient collateral to borrow an additional $69 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank at December 31, 2017.  In addition, as of December 31, 2017, $48 million is available in overnight borrowing through various correspondent banks and the Company has access to an additional $304 million in brokered deposits. Generally, the Company relies upon net cash inflows from financing activities, supplemented by net cash inflows from operating activities, to provide cash used in its investing activities.  As is typical of many financial institutions, significant financing activities include deposit gathering, and the use of short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements along with long-term debt.  The Company's primary investing activities include purchasing investment securities and loan originations.  Management believes there is sufficient cash flow from operations to meet investing and liquidity needs related to reasonable borrower, depositor and creditor needs in the present economic environment. 32 The cash flow statements for the periods presented provide an indication of the Company's sources and uses of cash as well as an indication of the ability of the Company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. A number of other techniques are used to measure the liquidity position, including the ratios presented below.  These ratios are calculated based on annual averages for each year. December 31,  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Liquidity Ratios 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2017 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2016 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2015 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Average Loans (including loans held for sale)/Average Deposits 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 81.5 				 				 					 						%   				 				 					 						 84.2 				 				 					 						%   				 				 					 						 82.6 				 				 					 						% 				 			 					 						Average Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings/Average Assets 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 3.3 				 				 					 						%   				 				 					 						 3.6 				 				 					 						%   				 				 					 						 2.9 				 				 					 						% The above table shows that the average loan to deposit ratio was lower in 2017 when compared to both 2016 and 2015. This is attributed to loan balances decreasing in 2017 while deposits have increased each year.","Item 8.

The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  The consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments.  Management also prepared other information in the annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements. The Company's 2017 consolidated financial statements have been audited by Crowe Horwath LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. 33 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. Paris, Kentucky Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 34 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. (the Company), its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Kentucky Bank (the Bank) and KBI Insurance Company, Inc., a captive insurance subsidiary, and the Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary, KB Special Assets Unit, LLC.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Nature of Operations:  The Bank operates under a state bank charter and provides full banking services, including trust services, to customers located in Bourbon, Clark, Elliot, Fayette, Harrison, Jessamine, Madison, Rowan, Scott, Woodford and adjoining counties in Kentucky.  As a state bank, the Bank is subject to regulation by the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  The Company, a bank holding company, is regulated by the Federal Reserve. KBI Insurance Company, Inc., a captive insurance subsidiary, is regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance. Estimates in the Financial Statements:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash Flows:  For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, and certain short-term investments with maturities of less than three months.  Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods.  Net cash flows are reported for loan, deposit and short-term borrowing transactions. Interest Bearing Time Deposits: Interest bearing time deposits in other financial institutions have original maturities between one and three years and are carried at cost. Securities:  The Company is required to classify its securities portfolio into one of three categories:  trading securities, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.  Fair value adjustments are made to the securities based on their classification with the exception of the held to maturity category.  The Company has no investments classified as held to maturity.  Securities available for sale and trading securities are carried at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses for securities which are classified as available for sale are reported in other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax.  Unrealized holding gains and losses for securities which are classified as trading securities are reported in other income. Interest income includes amortization of purchase premium or discount.  Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage backed securities where prepayments are anticipated.  Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the settlement date and determined using the specific identification method. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (""OTTI"") at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.  For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer.  Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis.  If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings.  For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and 2) other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income.  The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis.  For equity securities, the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings. 43 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Loans Held for Sale:  Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by outstanding commitments from investors or current secondary market prices, calculated on the aggregate loan basis.  The Company also provides for any losses on uncovered commitments to lend or sell.  Loans are generally sold with servicing rights retained but with some exceptions. Loans:  Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, net of deferred loan origination fees and costs and acquired purchase premiums and discounts, reduced by an allowance for loan losses.  Interest income on loans is recognized  on the accrual basis except for those loans on a nonaccrual status.  Interest income on real estate mortgage (1-4 family residential and multi-family residential) and consumer loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent, and interest income on real estate construction, non-farm and non-residential mortgage, agricultural and commercial loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 120 days delinquent, unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection.  Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan.  In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.  Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans.  Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are capitalized and recognized as an adjustment of the yield on the related loan.  Recorded investment is the outstanding loan balance, excluding accrued interest receivable. When interest accrual is discontinued, interest income received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual.  Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.  Typically, the Company seeks to establish a payment history of at least six consecutive payments made on a timely basis before returning a loan to accrual status.  Consumer and credit card loans are typically charged off no later than 120 days past due.  Loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Concentration of Credit Risk:  Most of the Company's business activity is with customers located within Bourbon, Clark, Elliott, Fayette, Harrison, Jessamine, Madison, Rowan, Scott, Woodford and surrounding counties located in Kentucky.  Therefore, the Company's exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy in these counties. Allowance for Loan Losses:  The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses.  Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.  Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Adjustments are made to the historical loss experience ratios based on the qualitative factors as outlined in the regulatory Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.  These qualitative factors include the nature and volume of portfolio, economic and business conditions, classification, past due and non-accrual trends.  Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors.  Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated at the portfolio segment level using the same methodology for each segment.  The recent historical actual net losses is the basis for the general reserve for each segment which is then adjusted for qualitative factors as outlined above (i.e., nature and volume of portfolio, economic and business conditions, classification, past due and non-accrual trends) specifically evaluated at individual segment levels. The allowance consists of specific and general components.  The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired.  The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors for non-classified loans and a migration analysis for classified loans. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Loans, for which the terms have been modified, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and has been granted a concession, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. 44 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Loans are charged off when available information confirms that loans, or portions thereof, are uncollectible.  While management considers the number of days a loan is past due in its evaluation process, we also consider a variety of other factors. Factors considered by management in evaluating the charge-off decision include collateral value, availability of current financial information for both borrower and guarantor, and the probability of collecting contractual principal and interest payments.  These considerations may result in loans being charged off before they are 90 days or more past due.  This evaluation framework for determining charge-offs is consistently applied to each segment. From time to time, the Company will charge-off a portion of impaired and non-performing loans.  Loans that meet the criteria under ASC 310 are evaluated individually for impairment.  Management considers payment status, collateral value, availability of current financial information for the borrower and guarantor, actual and expected cash flows, and probability of collecting amounts due.  If a loan's collection status is deemed to be collateral dependent or foreclosure is imminent, the loan is charged down to the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs.  In circumstances where the loan is not deemed to be collateral dependent, but we believe, after completing our evaluation process, that probable loss has been incurred, we will provide a specific allocation on that loan. The impact of recording partial charge-offs is a reduction of gross loans and a reduction of the loan loss reserve.  The net loan balance is unchanged in instances where the loan had a specific allocation as a component of the allowance for loan losses.  The allowance as a percentage of total loans may be lower as the allowance no longer needs to include a component for the loss, which has now been recorded, and net charge-off amounts are increased as partial charge-offs are recorded. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.  Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.  Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Commercial and real estate construction and real estate mortgage loans (multi-family residential, and non-farm and non-residential mortgage) over $200 thousand are individually evaluated for impairment.  If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.  Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and 1-4 family residential real estate loans, are collectively evaluated for impairment, and accordingly, they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures.  Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception.    If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, the Company determines the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors.  The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent 5 years.  This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment.  These economic factors include consideration of the following:  levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. A ""portfolio segment"" is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its allowance for loan losses.  The Company has identified the following portfolio segments:  commercial, real estate construction, real estate mortgage, agricultural, consumer (credit cards and other consumer) and other (overdrafts). 45 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Commercial:  These loans to businesses do not have real estate as the underlying collateral.  Instead of real estate, collateral could be business assets such as equipment or accounts receivable or the personal guarantee of one or more guarantors.  These loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by commercial real estate because in the event of default by the borrower, the business assets must be liquidated and/or guarantors pursued for deficit funds.  Business assets are worth more while they are in use to produce income for the business and worth significantly less if the business is no longer in operation. Real estate construction:  Real estate construction consists of loans secured by real estate for additions or alterations to existing structures, as well as constructing new structures.  They include fixed and floating rate loans.  Real estate construction loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate primarily because of the length of the construction period, potential change in prices of construction, the incomplete status of the collateral and economic cycles.  Because of these factors, real estate construction loans generally have higher qualitative adjustments. Real Estate Mortgage: 1-4 family residential:  Loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate represent the lowest risk of loans for the Company.  They include fixed and floating rate loans as well as loans for commercial purposes or consumer purposes.  The Company generally does not hold subprime residential mortgages. Borrowers with loans in this category, whether for commercial or consumer purposes, tend to make their payments timely as they do not want to risk foreclosure and loss of property. Multifamily residential:  Loans secured by multifamily residential real estate consist primarily of loans secured by apartment buildings and can be either fixed or floating rate loans.  Multi-family residential real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate because the borrower's repayment ability typically comes from rents from tenants.  Local economic and employment fluctuations impact rent rolls and potentially the borrower's repayment ability. Non-farm & non-residential:  Loans secured by non-farm non-residential real estate consist of loans secured by commercial real estate that is not owner occupied.  These loans generally consist of loans collateralized by property whereby rents received from commercial tenants of the borrower are the source of repayment.   These loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by owner occupied commercial real estate because repayment risk is expanded to be dependent on the success of multiple businesses which are paying rent to the borrower.  If multiple businesses fail due to deteriorating economic conditions or poor business management skills, the borrower may not have enough rents to cover their monthly payment.  Repayment risk is also increased depending on the level of surplus available commercial lease space in the local market area. Agricultural:  These loans to agricultural businesses do not have real estate as the underlying collateral.  Instead of real estate, collateral could be assets such as equipment or accounts receivable or the personal guarantee of one or more guarantors.  These loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by real estate because in the event of default by the borrower, the assets must be liquidated and/or guarantors pursued for deficit funds.  Farm assets are worth more while they are in use to produce income and worth significantly less if the farm is no longer in operation. Consumer:  Consumer loans are generally loans to borrowers for non-business purposes.  They can be either secured or unsecured.  Consumer loans are generally small in the individual amount of principal outstanding and are repaid from the borrower's private funds earned from employment.  Consumer lending risk is very susceptible to local economic trends.  If there is a consumer loan default, any collateral that may be repossessed is generally not well maintained and has a diminished value.  For this reason, consumer loans tend to have higher overall interest rates to cover the higher cost of repossession and charge-offs.  However, due to their smaller average balance per borrower, consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment in determining the appropriate allowance for loan losses. Other:  All other loan types are aggregated together for credit risk evaluation due to the varying nature but small number of the remaining types of loans in the Company's loan portfolio.  Loans in this segment include but are not limited to overdrafts.  Due to their smaller balance, other loans are collectively evaluated for impairment in determining the appropriate allowance for loan losses. 46 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Due to the overall high level of real estate mortgage loans within the loan portfolio as a whole, as compared to other portfolio segments, for risk assessment and allowance purposes this segment was segregated into more granular pools by collateral property type. The non-farm non-residential and the multi-family real estate mortgage loan portfolio segments had the next highest level of qualitative adjustments due to the effects of local markets and economies on the underlying collateral property values, as well as for industry concentrations and risks related to the this type of property.  Within the commercial portfolio, risk analysis is performed primarily based on the individual loan type. Mortgage Servicing Rights:  The Bank has sold certain residential mortgage loans to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) while retaining the servicing rights. Servicing rights are recognized separately when they are acquired through sales of loans.  When mortgage loans are sold, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in gain on sale of mortgage loans.  Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income.  The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.  All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into loan service fee income, net, included in non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount.  Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type.  Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount.  If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income.  The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement as loan service income, net, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans.  The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned.  The amortization of mortgage servicing rights and valuation allowance are netted against loan servicing fee income.  Servicing fees totaled $560 thousand, $510 thousand, and $486 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and are included in loan service fee income in the income statement.  Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material. Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Stock:  The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts.  FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.  Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Bank Premises and Equipment:  Land is carried at cost.  Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Buildings and related components are depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 5 to 40 years.  Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line (or accelerated) method with useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years. Real Estate Owned:  Real estate acquired through foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis.  These assets are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell.  The value of the underlying loan is written down to the fair value of the real estate to be acquired by a charge to the allowance for loan losses, if necessary.  Any subsequent write-downs are charged to operating expenses.  Operating expenses of such properties, net of related income, and gains and losses on their disposition are included in other expenses. 47 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Investments in Limited Partnerships:  Investments in limited partnerships represent the Company's investments in affordable housing projects for the primary purpose of available tax benefits.  The Company is a limited partner in these investments and as such, the Company is not involved in the management or operation of such investments.  These investments are amortized over the period that the Company expects to receive the tax benefits.  These investments are evaluated for impairment when events indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The investment recorded at December 31, 2017 was $3.8 million and $4.7 million at December 31, 2016, respectively, and is included with other assets in the balance sheet.  During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized amortization expense of $799 thousand and $793 thousand, respectively, which was included within other noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of income. Repurchase Agreements:  Substantially all repurchase agreement liabilities represent amounts advanced by various customers.  Securities are pledged to cover these liabilities, which are not covered by federal deposit insurance. Stock-Based Compensation:  Compensation cost is recognized for stock options and restricted stock awards issued to employees, based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant.  A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards.  Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period.  For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Income Taxes:  Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates.  A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is ""more likely than not"" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur.  The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination.  For tax positions not meeting the ""more likely than not"" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest related to income tax matters as interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as other expense. Retirement Plans:  Employee 401(k) and profit sharing plan expense is the amount of matching contributions. Goodwill and Intangible Assets:  Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually.  The Company has selected December 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test.  Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.  Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet. Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions.  They are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized on either an accelerated or straight-line basis, over ten or fifteen years. Purchased Credit Impaired Loans:  As part of the Madison Financial Corporation acquisition, the Company purchased loans, some of which have shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination. These purchased credit impaired loans are recorded at the amount paid, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Such purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually.  The Company estimated the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan and the expected cash flows in excess of amount paid is recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated.  If the present value of expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded as a provision for loan losses.  If the present value of expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income. 48 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments:  Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs.  The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay.  Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. Earnings Per Common Share:  Basic earnings per common share is net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares issuable under stock options.  Earnings and dividends per share are restated for all stock splits and dividends through the date of issuance of the financial statements. Comprehensive Income (Loss):  Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income.  Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, which are also recognized as a separate component of equity. Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note.  Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.  Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates. Operating Segments:  While the Company's chief decision makers monitor the revenue streams of the various Company products and services, operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis.  Accordingly, all of the Company's operations are considered by management to be aggregated into one reportable operating segment: banking. Reclassifications:  Some items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income or stockholders' equity. Adoption of New Accounting Standards ASU 2016-15, ""Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."" Issued in August 2016, ASU 2016-15 provides guidance to reduce the diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments of ASU 2016-15 provide guidance on eight specific cash flow: (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (ii) settlement of zero-coupon bonds; (iii) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; (iv) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; (vi) distributions received from equity method investees; (vii) beneficial interests in securitization transactions and (viii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The amendments of ASU 2016-15 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management has evaluated the amendments of ASU 2016-15 and does not believe that adoption of this ASU will impact Kentucky Bancshares existing presentation of the applicable cash receipts and cash payments on its consolidated statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-13, ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."" Issued in June 2016, ASU 2016-13 will add Financial Accounting Standards Board ""FASB"" ASC Topic 326, ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses"" and finalizes amendments to FASB ASC Subtopic 825-15, ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses."" The amendments of ASU 2016-13 are intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information related to expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit by replacing the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit loss estimates. The amendments of ASU 2016-13 eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold and, in turn, reflect an entity's current estimate of all expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 does not specify the method for measuring expected credit losses, and an entity is allowed to apply methods that reasonably reflect its expectations of the credit loss estimate. Additionally, the amendments of ASU 2016-13 require that credit losses on available for sale debt securities be presented as an allowance rather than as a writedown. 49 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) The amendments of ASU 2016-13 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Kentucky Bancshares plans to adopt the amendments of ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2020. Kentucky Bancshares has established a steering committee which includes the appropriate members of management to evaluate the impact this ASU will have on the Company's financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures and determine the most appropriate method of implementing the amendments in this ASU as well as any resources needed to implement the amendments. ASU 2016-09, ""Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" Issued in March 2016, ASU 2016-09 seeks to reduce complexity in accounting standards by simplifying several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The amendments of ASU 2016-09 include: (i) requiring all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement; (ii) requiring excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity on the statement of cash flow; (iii) allowing an entity to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that expect to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur; (iv) change the threshold to qualify for equity classification to permit withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions; and (v) requiring that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes to be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. The amendments of ASU 2016-09 became effective for Kentucky Bancshares on January 1, 2017 and did not have a material impact on Kentucky Bancshares consolidated financial statements. The Company has made an entity-wide accounting policy election to account for forfeitures of stock awards as they occur. Changes to Kentucky Bancshares consolidated statement of cash flows required by the amendments of ASU 2016-09 are incorporated into the presentation in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2017. ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842"":    In February 2016, the FASB issued its new lease accounting guidance in ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, all leases in which Kentucky Bancshares was the lessee were classified as operating leases.  Based on leases outstanding at December 31, 2017, we do not expect the new standard to have a material impact on our balance sheet. Decisions to repurchase, modify, or renew leases prior to the implementation date will impact this level of materiality ASU 2016-01, ""Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (An Amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification)."" Issued in January 2016, ASU 2016-01 is intended to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with improved decision-making information. The amendments of ASU 2016-01 include: (i) requiring equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of an investee, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (ii) requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values; (iii) eliminating the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (iv) requiring the use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (v) requiring an entity that has elected the fair value option to measure the fair value of a liability to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the change in the fair value resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk; (vi) requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and (vii) clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. The amendments of ASU 2016-01 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Kentucky Bancshares plans to adopt the amendments of ASU 2016-01 during the first quarter of 2018. 50 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Management has evaluated the impact this ASU will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financials statements. ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."" Issued in May 2014, ASU 2014-09 will add FASB ASC Topic 606, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers,"" and will supersede revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, ""Revenue Recognition,"" as well as certain cost guidance in FASB ASC Topic 605-35, ""Revenue Recognition  -  Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts."" ASU 2014-09 provides a framework for revenue recognition that replaces the existing industry and transaction specific requirements under the existing standards.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to apply a five-step model to determine when to recognize revenue and at what amount.  The model specifies that revenue should be recognized when (or as) an entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the amount in which the entity expects to be entitled. Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenue should be recognized either over time, in a manner that depicts the entity's performance, or at a point in time, when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer. ASU 2014-09 provides that an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of non-financial assets that are not in a contract with a customer are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement in ASU 2014-09. The amendments of ASU 2014-09 may be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application.  If the transition method of application is elected, the entity should also provide the additional disclosures in reporting periods that include the date of initial application of (1) the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and (2) an explanation of the reasons for significant changes. ASU 2015-14, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)- Deferral of the Effective Date,"" issued in August 2015, defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  ASU 2015-14 provides that the amendments of ASU 2014-09 become effective for interim and annual periods beginning  after December 15, 2017. All subsequently issued ASUs which provide additional guidance and clarifications to various aspects of FASB ASC Topic 606 will become effective when the amendments of ASU 2014-09 become effective.  Kentucky Bancshares plans to adopt these amendments during the first quarter of 2018. Management is continuing to  evaluate the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on Kentucky Bancshares consolidated financial statements as well as the most appropriate transition method of application. Based on this evaluation to date, Management has determined that the majority of the revenues earned by Kentucky Bancshares are not within the scope of ASU 2014-09. Management also believes that for most revenue streams within the scope of ASU 2014-09, the amendments will not change the timing of when the revenue is recognized. Management has evaluated the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on Kentucky Bancshares consolidated financial statements, focusing on noninterest income sources within the scope of ASU 2014-09 as well as new disclosures required by these amendments.  The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material impact on Kentucky Bancshares consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-04 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment: In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, under the new guidance, an entity is to perform its annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. 51 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019, which for Kentucky Bancshares will be effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-08 - Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities:  In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08 - Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities. This ASU amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. It shortens the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date. Under current U.S. GAAP, premiums on callable debt securities generally are amortized to the maturity date. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, which for Kentucky Bancshares will be the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual periods which Kentucky Bancshares elected to do as of December 31, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Update 2017-01 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business: The amendments in this ASU are intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Public business entities should apply the amendments in this update to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which for Kentucky Bancshares will be the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within those periods. All other entities should apply the amendments to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. ASU 2017-09 - Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting: In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09 - Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU amends the guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual periods. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on Kentucky Bancshares consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-12, ""Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.""  Issued in August 2017, ASU 2017-12 aims to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments in ASU 2017-12 aim to better align an entity's risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships by expanding and refining hedge accounting for both non-financial and financial risk components and aligning the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. The amendments in ASU 2017-12 (i) permit hedge accounting for risk components in hedging relationships involving nonfinancial risk and interest rate risk; (ii) change the guidance for designating fair value hedges of interest rate risk and for measuring the change in fair value of the hedged item in fair value hedges of interest rate risk; (iii) continue to allow an entity to exclude option premiums and forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness; and (iv) permit an entity to exclude the portion of the change in fair value of a currency swap that is attributable to a cross-country basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The amendments of ASU 2017-12 also include targeted improvements intended to simplify the application of hedge accounting. The amendments of ASU 2017-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, which for Kentucky Bancshares is January 1, 2019. All transition requirements and elections must be applied to all hedging relationships existing at the date of adoption. Kentucky Bancshares plans to adopt ASU 2017-12 during the first quarter of 2019 using the required modified retrospective transition method. Kentucky Bancshares is currently not impacted by ASU 2017-12.  However, if the Company does become involved with derivatives or hedge accounting, the Company will recognize the cumulative effect of the change, if any, in the beginning balance of each affected component of equity as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 52 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) ASU 2018-02, ""Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)  -  Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehenisve Income.""    On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted a tax bill, H.R.1, An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018 (""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"").  Stakeholders in the banking and insurance industries submitted unsolicited comment letters to the FASB about a narrow-scope financial reporting issue that arose as a consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  Specifically, stakeholders expressed concern about the guidance in current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates with the effect included in income from continuing operations in the reporting period that includes the enactment date. That guidance is applicable even in situations in which the related income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income were originally recognized in other comprehensive income (rather than in income from continuing operations).  Those stakeholders asserted that because the adjustment of deferred taxes due to the reduction of the historical corporate income tax rate to the newly enacted corporate income tax rate is required to be included in income from continuing operations, the tax effects of items within accumulated other comprehensive income (referred to as stranded tax effects for purposes of ASU 2018-02) do not reflect the appropriate tax rate. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Consequently, the amendments eliminate the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users. However, because the amendments only relate to the reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the underlying guidance that requires that the effect of a change in tax laws or rates be included in income from continuing operations is not affected.  The amendments in ASU 2018-02 also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of the amendments in ASU 2018-02 is permitted, including adoption in any interim period, (1) for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) for all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance.  The Company has chosen to early adopt the amendments in ASU 2018-02 as of December 31, 2017. NOTE 2 - RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS Included in cash and due from banks are certain interest bearing deposits that are held at the Federal Reserve or maintained in vault cash in accordance with average balance requirements specified by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  The reserve requirement was $2.1 million at December 31, 2017 and $2.3 million at December 31, 2016. 53 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) NOTE 3 - SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of the securities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the corresponding amounts of gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows: Gross 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Gross 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Amortized 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Unrealized 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Unrealized 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Fair 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Cost 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Gains 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Losses 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Value 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Available for Sale 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  					 						December 31, 2017 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						     U.S. treasury notes 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 4,046 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (22) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 4,024 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						U.

In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer's financial condition. Unrealized losses on securities have not been recognized into income because the issues are of high credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that management would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates.  The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity. At December 31, 2017, one U.S. treasury note has an unrealized loss of 0.6% from its amortized cost basis, thirteen U.S. government agency securities have unrealized losses of 1.1% from their amortized cost, eighteen commercial mortgage backed securities have unrealized losses of 1.5% from their amortized cost basis, sixty-four residential mortgage backed securities have unrealized losses of 1.8% from their amortized cost basis, and twenty-three states and municipals have unrealized losses of 0.7% from their amortized cost basis.  Management believes the declines in fair value from these and other securities are largely due to changes in interest rates.  The Company believes there is no other-than-temporary impairment and does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. At December 31, 2017, the Company held no trading assets.  However, at December 31, 2016, the Company held $5.6 million in trading assets, which were excluded from securities available for sale, and consisted primarily of municipal securities.  These assets were generally held for a mininmal period of time. 55 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) NOTE 4 - LOANS Loans at year-end were as follows: 12/31/2017 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						12/31/2016 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Commercial 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 80,070 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 77,436 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Real estate construction 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 20,816 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 29,169 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Real estate mortgage: 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						1-4 family residential 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 238,121 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 244,638 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Multi-family residential 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 39,926 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 47,199 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Non-farm & non-residential 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 192,074 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 176,024 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Agricultural 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 59,176 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 62,491 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Consumer 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 18,182 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 18,867 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Other 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 170 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 183 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Total 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 648,535 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 656,007 The following table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment for the years ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): Beginning 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Ending 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						December 31, 2017 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Balance 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Charge-offs 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Recoveries 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Provision 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Balance 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Commercial 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 789 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (35) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 19 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 202 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 975 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Real estate Construction 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 564 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -

The Company has allocated $0 and $40 thousand in reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.  The Company has not committed to lend additional amounts as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings. During the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, no loans were modified that met the definition of troubled debt restructuring. The allowance for loan losses for loans classified as troubled debt restructurings decreased $40 thousand for the year ending December 31, 2017 and decreased $61 thousand for the year ending December 31, 2016.  Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings  resulted in no charge offs during the periods ending December 31, 2017 and 2016.  For the years ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no loans modified as troubled debt restructurings defaulted on payment. Credit Quality Indicators: The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as:  current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.  The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk.  This analysis includes primarily non-homogeneous loans with an outstanding balance greater than $200 thousand such as commercial and commercial real estate loans.  This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis.  The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention.  Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. Substandard.  Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful.  Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 61 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans.

Non-performing consumer loans are loans which are greater than 89 days past due or on non-accrual status, and total $26 thousand at December 31, 2017 and $8 thousand at December 31, 2016. Non-consumer loans with an outstanding balance less than $200 thousand are evaluated similarly to consumer loans. Loan performance is evaluated based on delinquency status. Both are reviewed at least quarterly and credit quality grades are updated as needed.

Impairment exists when a reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined through a two-step impairment test.  Step 1 includes the determination of the carrying value of our single reporting unit, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit.  We determined the fair value of our reporting unit and compared it to its carrying amount.  If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we are required to perform a second step to the impairment test. Our annual impairment analysis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 indicated that the Step 2 analysis was not necessary.  If needed, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the impairment loss.  Step 2 requires that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill.

The Trust issued $217 thousand of common securities to the Company and $7 million of trust preferred securities as part of a pooled offering of such securities.  The Company issued $7.2 million subordinated debentures to the Trust in exchange for the proceeds of the offering, which debentures represent the sole asset of the Trust.  The debentures paid interest quarterly at 7.06% for the first 5 years.  Starting September 2008, the rate converted to three-month LIBOR plus 3.00% adjusted quarterly, which was 4.60% at year-end 2017.  The Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of this Trust (variable interest entity), therefore the trust is not consolidated in the Company's financial statements, but rather the subordinated debentures are shown as a liability. The Company may redeem the subordinated debentures, in whole or in part, beginning September 2008 at a price of 100% of face value.  The subordinated debentures must be redeemed no later than 2033.  The Company has the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed five consecutive years. The subordinated debentures may be included in Tier I capital (with certain limitations applicable) under current regulatory guidelines and interpretations.

Accordingly, the Company has recorded an estimated $443 thousand for the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets to estimate the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the lowering of the federal corporate tax rate to 21%, At December 31, 2017, the Company early adopted ASU 2018-02 and reclassified out of retained earnings and into accumulated other comprehensive income $164 thousand of tax expense that was recorded to income tax expense at December 31, 2017 due to re-measuring to 21% deferred taxes on available for sale securities Federal income tax laws provided the First Federal Savings Bank, acquired by the Company in 2003, with additional bad debt deductions through 1987, totaling $1.3 million.  Accounting standards do not require a deferred tax liability to be recorded on this amount, which otherwise would total a $272 thousand liability at December 31, 2017.  The Company's acquisition of First Federal Savings Bank did not require the recapture of the bad debt reserve. 68 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) However, if Kentucky Bank was liquidated or otherwise ceased to be a bank, or if tax laws were to change, the $272 thousand would be recorded as expense. Unrecognized Tax Benefits The Company does not have any beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months. There were no interest and penalties recorded in the income statement or accrued for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. Corporation income tax return and a corporate income tax return in the state of Kentucky.  The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2014.

Restricted stock grants for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were included in shares outstanding for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. NOTE 14 - RETIREMENT PLAN The Company has a qualified profit sharing plan which covers substantially all employees and includes a 401(k) provision.  Profit sharing contributions, excluding the 401(k) provision, are at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors.  Expense recognized in connection with the plan was $939 thousand, $925 thousand and $815 thousand in 2017, 2016 and 2015. NOTE 15 - STOCK BASED COMPENSATION The Company has three share based compensation plans as described below.  Total compensation cost that has been charged against income for those plans was $163 thousand, $153 thousand, and $133 thousand for 2017, 2016 and 2015. One Stock Option Plan Under the expired 1993 Non-Employee Directors Stock Ownership Incentive Plan, the Company had granted certain directors stock option awards which vest and become fully exercisable immediately and provided for issuance of up to 20,000 options.  The exercise price of each option, which has a ten year life, was equal to the market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model that uses various assumptions.  Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company's common stock.  The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. 69 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable.  The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.  No options were granted in 2017, 2016 or 2015.

NOTE 16 - LIMITATION ON BANK DIVIDENDS The Company's principal source of funds is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank without prior approval of regulatory agencies.  Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year's net profits, as defined, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years.  During 2018 the Bank could, without prior approval, declare dividends on any 2018 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration plus $7.2 million. NOTE 17 - FAIR VALUE Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1  -  Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2  -  Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3  -  Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value: Securities Available for Sale and Trading Assets:  The fair values for investment securities and trading assets are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1).  For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). Impaired Loans:  The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 71 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower's financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and client's business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification.  Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted in accordance with the allowance policy. Other Real Estate Owned:  Assets acquired through, or instead of, loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis.  These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. Loan Servicing Rights:  Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income, resulting in a Level 3 classification. Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis Available for sale investment securities are the Company's only balance sheet item that meet the disclosure requirements for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Disclosures are as follows in the tables below.

previously presented, used to estimate fair value are described as follows:  Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing deposits, accrued interest receivable and payable, demand deposits, short-term debt, and variable rate loans or deposits that reprice frequently and fully.  The methods for determining the fair values for securities were described previously. For fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk (including consideration of widening credit spreads). The method used to determine the fair value of loans does not necessarily represent an exit price. Fair value of debt is based on current rates for similar financing.  It was not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.  The fair value of off-balance sheet items is not considered material. NOTE 18 - OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES AND COMMITMENTS Some financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates.  Commitments may expire without being used.  Off-balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated.  The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment. Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk were as follows at year-end (in thousands): 2017 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2016 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Fixed Rate 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Variable Rate 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Fixed Rate 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Variable Rate 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Unused lines of credit 				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 98,413 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 102,088 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Commitments to make loans 				 				 					 						  				 				 4,915 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 12,334 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 12,526 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 17,040 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Letters of credit 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 672 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 463 Unused lines of credit are substantially all at variable rates.  Commitments to make loans are generally made for a period of 60 days or less and are originated at current market rates ranging from 3.25% to 7.10% with maturities ranging up to 30 years. NOTE 19 - CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's and the Bank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Company and Bank capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for US banks (Basel III rules) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019.  Under the Basell III rules, the Company must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios.  The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.0% for 2015 to 2.50% by 2019.  The capital conservation buffer for 2017 is 1.25% and was 0.625% for 2016.  The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital to average assets (as defined).  Management believes, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. The most recent notification from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum Total risk-based, Tier I risk-based and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the following table.  There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution's category. The Company's and the Bank's actual amounts and ratios, exclusive of the capital conservation buffer, are presented in the table below: To Be Well

After the associated income tax expense, this transaction increased net income by $789 thousand. 80 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) NOTE 22  -  ACQUISITION OF MADISON FINANCIAL CORPORATION On July 24, 2015, the Company acquired Madison Financial Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Madison Bank, both of which were headquartered in Richmond, Kentucky.  As a result of the acquisition the Company expanded its presence into central Kentucky with minimal overlap of its existing market footprint and generated long-term value for the Company shareholders.  Madison Bank had $116.1 million in total assets and operated three financial centers. The total purchase price for Madison Financial Corporation was $7.9 million net of capital stock issuance costs, consisting of $3 thousand cash for fractional shares and the issuance of 263,361 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $7.9 million net of capital stock issuance costs.  The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  Accordingly, the Company recognized amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values, while approximately $858 thousand of transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition were expensed as incurred.  Of the total purchase price, $884 thousand was allocated to goodwill which is not considered deductible for tax purposes. Based on management's valuation of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the purchase price for the Madison Financial Corporation acquisition is allocated as follows (in thousands): Cash and cash equivalents 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 3,517 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 2,979 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Securities available for sale 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 27,704 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Loans 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 77,729 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 1,053 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Accrued interest receivable 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 309 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Premises and equipment 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 789 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Other real estate 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 445 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Deferred tax assets 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 624 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Core deposit intangible asset 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 800 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Other assets 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 116 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Total assets acquired 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 116,065 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Deposits 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 95,823 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Other borrowings 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 6,245 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Accrued interest payable 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 59 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Other liabilities 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 817 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Total liabilities assumed 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 102,944 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Liquidation amount of preferred stock including unpaid dividends and interest 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 6,066 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Total identifiable net assets 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 7,055 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Goodwill 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 884 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 7,939 81 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  		  		  			(Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) The table below shows loans purchased in the acquisition of Madison Financial Corporation.

The fair value adjustments were determined using discounted contractual cash flows.  However, the Company believes that all contractual cash flows related to these loans will be collected.  As such, these loan receivables were not considered impaired at the acquisition date and were not subject to the guidance relating to purchase credit impaired loans, which have shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination.  Loan receivables acquired that were not subject to these requirements include non-impaired loans with a fair value and gross contractual amounts receivable of $73.6 million and $74.7 million as of the date of acquisition. 82","Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Kentucky Bancshares' management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  As of December 31, 2017, an evaluation was carried out by Kentucky Bancshares' management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on this evaluation, management concluded that disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017 were effective in ensuring material information required to be disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There were no changes in Kentucky Bancshares' internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Kentucky Bancshares internal control over financial reporting. 83 MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL We, as management of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries, are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  			 		 			 			Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  			 		 			 			Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  			 		 			 			Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls.  Accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.  Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time. Because of the inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected.  Also, projections of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures included in such controls may deteriorate. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on the control criteria in the 2013 COSO Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (""COSO"") of the Treadway Commission.  Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that Kentucky Bancshares' internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2017. The effectiveness of Kentucky Bancshares' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Crowe Horwath, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited Kentucky Bancshares' consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000232/0001558370-18-002201-index.html"

Our Company We are an established nationwide independent residential mortgage lender. We were founded in 1995 by certain members of our current management team, who have extensive experience and an established track record of operating our Company through multiple market cycles. We originate, sell and service residential mortgage loans. We primarily originate conventional mortgage loans eligible for sale to U.S. government - sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac (conventional loans), and government - insured mortgage loans eligible for government securities issued through Ginnie Mae (government loans). Segments Our business activities are organized and presented in three primary operating segments: Mortgage Lending, Real Estate Services and the Long - Term Mortgage Portfolio. Our mortgage lending segment provides mortgage lending products through three lending channels, retail, wholesale and correspondent, retains mortgage servicing rights and provides warehouse lending facilities.  Our real estate services segment performs master servicing and provides loss mitigation services for primarily our securitized long-term mortgage portfolio.  And, our long-term mortgage portfolio consists of residual interests in securitization trusts.  A description of each operating segment is presented below with further details and discussions of each segment's results of operations presented in Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations."" In addition to the segments described above, we also have a corporate segment, which supports all of the operating segments. The corporate segment includes unallocated corporate and other administrative costs as described below. Mortgage Lending We are focused on expanding our mortgage lending platform which provides conventional and government - insured mortgage loans as well as providing innovative products to meet the needs of borrowers not met by traditional conventional and government products. Our mortgage lending operation generates origination and processing fees, net of origination costs, at the time of origination as well as gains or unexpected losses when the loans are sold to third party investors, including the GSEs and Ginnie Mae. We retain mortgage servicing rights from the sale of mortgage loans and earn servicing fees, net of sub - servicer costs, from our mortgage servicing portfolio. From time to time, we sell mortgage servicing rights from our servicing portfolio. We also provide non-qualified mortgages (NonQM) which are generally loans that do not meet the qualified mortgage (QM) guidelines set out by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  We believe there is an underserved mortgage market for borrowers with good credit who may not meet the NonQM guidelines for example self-employed borrowers. During 2014, we rolled out and began originating NonQM loans. As the demand by consumers for the NonQM product grows we expect the investor appetite will increase for the NonQM mortgages. A NonQM borrower is generally less sensitive to interest rates and generally does not have the same income documentation that a conforming loan borrower does, nonetheless the borrower is still required to meet the ""ability to repay"" guidelines. As a nationwide mortgage lender, we are approved to originate and service Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae eligible loans. We primarily originate, sell and service conventional, conforming agency and government insured residential mortgage loans originated or acquired through our three channels: Retail (consumer direct), Correspondent and Wholesale.  			 		 			 			Retail (consumer direct) channel - CashCall Mortgage (CCM), operates as a centralized call center that utilizes a marketing platform to generate customer leads through the internet and call center loan 2 Table of Contents agents. As a centralized retail call center, loan applications are received and taken by loan agents directly from consumers and through the internet.  			 		 			 			Wholesale channel - Originates loans sourced through mortgage brokers.  			 		 			 			Correspondent channel - Acquires closed loans from approved correspondent sellers. Our warehouse lending group offers funding facilities to approved lenders focusing on smaller mortgage bankers and credit unions. These facilities allow our customers the ability to fund mortgage loans and sell closed loans to their investors. Our funding facilities are repaid when our customer sells the loans to the investor. Offering warehouse lending provides added value for our correspondent customers, which we believe will increase the capture rate from our currently approved customers and increase volumes in our correspondent channel. Our mortgage lending activities primarily consist of the origination, sale and servicing of conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and government - insured loans eligible for Ginnie Mae securities issuance. We currently originate and fund mortgages through our wholly - owned subsidiary, IMC. In order to originate mortgage loans we must be able to finance them and hold them on our balance sheet until such loans are sold, generally within 10 to 20 days. In order to do this we must have lines of credit with banks (called warehouse lines) that allow us the short term funding required. The following table presents selected data from our mortgage lending operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: (in millions) 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2017 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2016 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2015 				 			 					 						Originations 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 7,111.7 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 12,924.2 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 9,259.0 				 			 					 						Servicing Portfolio 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 16,330.1 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 12,351.5 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 3,570.7 				 			 					 						Mortgage servicing rights 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 154.4 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 131.5 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 36.4 				 			 					 						Servicing fees, net 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 31.9 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 13.7 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 6.1 Our origination volumes decreased 45% in 2017 to $7.1 billion as compared to $12.9 billion in 2016 and $9.3 billion in 2015. Of the $7.1  billion in total originations in 2017, approximately $4.6 billion, or 65%, was originated through the retail channel. In contrast, during 2016, our retail originations contributed 75% to our total origination volume. The decline in originations was the result of higher interest rates throughout 2017 as compared to the historically low interest rate environment during the previous years, causing a sharp drop in refinance volume. Our mortgage servicing portfolio increased in 2017 primarily due to servicing - retained sales of conforming GSE - eligible loans and government - insured loans eligible for Ginnie Mae securities, net of bulk sales of mortgage servicing rights. In 2017, we had servicing retained loan sales of $4.2 billion of conforming GSE - eligible loans and issued $1.9 billion of government securities through Ginnie Mae on a servicing retained basis as well as a purchase of approximately $570.0 million in unpaid principal balance (UPB) of mortgage servicing rights (MSR). Each of our three origination channels, Retail, Wholesale and Correspondent, produces similar mortgage loan products and applies similar underwriting standards.

The acquisition of CCM's residential lending platform in 2015 added a centralized retail call center to IMC's current business - to - business origination channels and provides additional 3 Table of Contents capacity to process increased origination volumes of expanded products including our NonQM loan programs and government insured Ginnie Mae programs, while profitably creating servicing assets for IMC. When loans are originated on a retail basis, the origination documentation is completed inclusive of customer disclosures and other aspects of the lending process and funding of the transaction is completed internally. Our call center representatives contact borrowers through either inbound or outbound marketing campaigns sourced from purchase - money and refinance mortgage leads, including leads sourced from customer referrals and retention of customers in the servicing portfolio that are seeking to refinance or purchase a property. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we closed $4.6 billion of loans in this origination channel, which equaled 65% of total originations, as compared to $9.7 billion or 75% of total originations during 2016. Wholesale - In a wholesale transaction, our account executives work directly with mortgage brokers who originate and document loans for delivery to our operational center where we underwrite and fund the mortgage loan. Each loan is underwritten to our underwriting standards and, if approved, the borrower is sent new disclosures under our name and the loan is funded in the name of Impac Mortgage. Prior to accepting loans from mortgage brokers, each mortgage broker is required to meet our guidelines for minimum experience, credit score and net worth. We also obtain a third - party due diligence report for each prospective broker that verifies licensing and provides information on any industry sanctions that might exist. In addition, each mortgage broker is required to sign our broker agreement that contains certain representations and warranties from the brokers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we closed loans totaling $1.1 billion in this origination channel, which equaled 15% of total originations, as compared to $1.3 billion or 10% of total originations during 2016. Correspondent - Our correspondent channel represents mortgage loans acquired from our correspondent sellers. Our correspondent channel has historically targeted a market of small banks, credit unions and small mortgage banking firms. Prior to accepting loans from correspondent sellers, each seller is underwritten to determine if it meets financial and other guidelines. Our review of each prospective seller includes obtaining a third party due diligence report that verifies licensing, insurance coverage, quality of recent Federal Housing Administration (FHA) originations and provides information on any industry sanctions that might exist. In addition, each seller is required to sign our correspondent seller agreement that contains certain representations and warranties from the seller allowing us to require the seller to repurchase a loan sold to us for various reasons including (i) ineligibility for sale to GSEs, (ii) early payment default, (iii) early pay - off or (iv) if the loan is uninsurable by a government agency. In our correspondent channel, the correspondent seller originates and closes the loan. After the loan is originated, the correspondent seller provides the needed documentation and information to us to review and determine if it meets our underwriting guidelines. The loan is acquired by us only after we approve it for purchase. We focus on customer service for our clients by facilitating prompt review by our due diligence team, providing bid pricing on both newly originated and seasoned portfolios, enabling clients to deliver one loan at a time on a flow basis and providing clients with expedited funding timelines. We purchase conventional loans eligible for sale to the GSEs and government - insured loans eligible for Ginnie Mae securities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we closed loans totaling $1.4 billion in the correspondent origination channel, which equaled 20% of total originations, compared to $1.9 billion or 15% of total originations during 2016. Since 2011, we have provided loans to customers predominantly in the Western U.S. with California, Washington and Arizona comprising 77.8% of originations in 2017. Currently, we provide nationwide lending with our retail call center and correspondent sellers and mortgage brokers. Loan Types Our loan products primarily include conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and loans eligible for government insurance by FHA, Veteran's Administration (VA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and also NonQM. The FHA, VA and USDA loans are government-insured loans eligible for Ginnie Mae securities issuance. We have enhanced our product offering to include more loan products less sensitive to changing interest rates, including FHA 203(k), a home improvement loan that provides the borrower funds to make renovations, intermediate Adjustable Rate Mortgages and GSE and government - insured loan 4 Table of Contents programs such as Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) loans which help timely paying borrowers to refinance into a loan with a lower interest rate despite the loan balance being greater than the estimated fair value of their home. We believe that these loan products will prepay at a slower rate as compared to other products. By retaining these loan products in our servicing portfolio, we expect to maintain a less volatile mortgage servicing portfolio. We have established strict lending guidelines, including determining the prospective borrowers' ability to repay the mortgage, which we believe will keep delinquencies and foreclosures at acceptable levels. We continue to refine our guidelines to expand our reach to the underserved market of credit worthy borrowers who can fully document and substantiate an ability to repay mortgage loans, but unable to obtain financing through traditional programs (QM loans), for example self-employed borrowers.  In 2016, we rebranded our NonQM loan programs as ""The Intelligent NonQM Mortgage"", to better communicate our NonQM loan value proposition to consumers, brokers, sellers and investors.  In conjunction with establishing strict lending guidelines, we have also established investor relationships which provide us with an exit strategy for these nonconforming loans.    In 2017, our NonQM origination volume was $891.2 million with an average Fair Isaac Company credit score (FICO) of 723 and a weighted average loan to value ratio (LTV) of 64%.

We primarily sell loans on a servicing - retained basis where the loan is sold to an investor such as Fannie Mae, and we retain the right to service that loan, called mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs. We securitize government-insured loans by issuing Ginnie Mae securities through a process whereby a pool of loans is transferred to Ginnie Mae as collateral for a government mortgage - backed security. To a lesser extent, we sell our residential mortgage loans on a whole loan basis where the investor also acquires the servicing rights.

We also sell loans on a servicing - released 5 Table of Contents basis to secondary market investors where we do not retain the servicing rights. When we retain servicing rights, we are entitled to receive a servicing fee which is collected from interest payments made by the borrower and paid to us on a monthly basis equal to a specified percentage, typically between 0.25% and 0.44% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the loans. We may also be entitled to receive additional servicing compensation, such as late payment fees and earn additional income through the use of non - interest bearing escrows. As a mortgage servicer, we are required to advance certain amounts to meet the contractual loan servicing requirements for certain investors. We may advance principal, interest, property taxes and insurance for borrowers that have become delinquent, plus any other costs to preserve the property. Also, we will advance funds to maintain, repair and market foreclosed real estate properties. Such advances are typically repaid when the loan becomes current or repaid from the proceeds generated from the sale of the property subsequent to foreclosure. We have hired a nationally recognized residential servicer to sub - service the servicing portfolio. Although we use a sub - servicer to provide primary servicing and certain default servicing functions, our servicing surveillance team, which is experienced in loss mitigation and real estate recovery, monitors and surveys the performance of the loans and sub - servicer. We generally earn a servicing fee on each loan, but we also incur the cost of the sub - servicer as well as the internal servicing surveillance team. Incurring the cost of both a sub - servicer and an internal surveillance team reduces the net revenues we earn from the mortgage servicing portfolio, however, we believe it reduces our risk by minimizing delinquencies and repurchase risk. During 2017, the mortgage servicing portfolio increased to $16.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 from $12.4 billion at the end of 2016, generating net servicing income of $31.9 million and $13.7 million, in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We also sell mortgage servicing rights to fund the expansion of origination volumes resulting in a decrease in our mortgage servicing portfolio. We may continue to monetize mortgage servicing rights as needed in the future. Furthermore, the value of mortgage servicing rights are affected by increases and decreases in mortgage interest rates. Therefore, volatility in mortgage rates generally causes volatility in the value of mortgage servicing rights. Risk Management Our risk management committee, comprised of senior management, meets monthly to identify, monitor, measure and mitigate key risks in the organization. The committee's responsibilities, sometimes delegated to subcommittees, include monitoring the hedging positions and its effectiveness in mitigating interest rate risk, status of aged unsold loans, status of loans on the warehouse lines, the review of quality control reports, review of servicing portfolio and loan performance and the adequacy of the repurchase reserve and methodology. Underwriting We primarily originate residential first mortgage loans for sale that conform to the respective underwriting guidelines established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA and USDA. Our mortgage loans are underwritten individually on a loan - by - loan basis. Each mortgage loan originated from our retail and wholesale channel are underwritten by one of our underwriters or by a third party contract underwriter using our underwriting guidelines. Each mortgage loan originated from our correspondent channel is reviewed internally or by a third party underwriting company to determine if the borrower meets our underwriting guidelines. Our criteria for underwriting generally include, but are not limited to, full documentation of borrower's income, assets, other relevant financial information, the specific agency's eligible loan - to - value ratios (LTV), borrower's debt - to - income ratio and full appraisals when required. Variances from any of these standards are permitted only to the extent allowable under the specific program requirements. Our underwriting procedures for all retail and wholesale loans require the use of a GSE automated underwriting system (AUS). Our underwriting procedures for all correspondent loans that have been originated by a correspondent seller includes a file review verifying that the borrower's credit and the collateral meet our applicable program guidelines and an appropriate AUS report has been completed. We also confirm the loan is compliant with regulatory guidelines. In addition, we perform quality control procedures on selected pools prior to our acquisition of the loan. 6 Table of Contents Quality Control Prior to funding, retail and wholesale loans are reviewed internally by our quality control department to verify the loan conforms to our program guidelines and meets state and federal compliance guidelines. Prior to the acquisition of a correspondent loan, we perform quality control procedures on selected pools. Management reviews the reports prior to the acquisition of any correspondent loan. We also perform post origination quality controls procedures on at least 10% of all mortgage loans funded or acquired. Additionally, we closely monitor the servicing performance of loans retained in our mortgage servicing portfolio to identify any opportunities to improve our underwriting process or procedures and identify any issues with mortgage brokers or correspondent sellers. Findings are summarized monthly and the appropriate changes are implemented. Hedging We are exposed to interest rate risks relating to our mortgage lending operations. We use derivative instruments to manage some of our interest rate risk. However, we do not attempt to hedge interest rate risk completely. Our strategy is to mitigate the market and interest rate risk from loan originations by either selling newly originated loans to GSEs or issuing Ginnie Mae mortgage - backed securities. We typically attempt to sell our mortgage loans within 10 to 20 days from acquisition or origination. We enter into interest rate lock commitments, or IRLCs, and commitments to sell mortgages to help mitigate some of the exposure to the effect of changing interest rates on our mortgage lending operation. We actively manage the IRLCs and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale on a daily basis. To manage the risk, we utilize forward sold Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae mortgage - backed securities, known as to - be - announced mortgage - backed securities (TBA MBS or Hedging Instruments), to hedge the fair value changes associated with changes in interest rates. We are also exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage servicing portfolio. Changes in interest rates affect the value of mortgage servicing rights on our consolidated balance sheets. To help manage the risk, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began to use TBA MBS securities to hedge a portion of the fair value changes associated with changes in interest rates. Data Security Sensitive borrower information, such as name, address and social security number is included in nearly all mortgage loan files. We seek to keep this information secure for every borrower. To do so, our policy requires all sensitive borrower data to be transmitted to us through our secure website portal which allows all of our customers, correspondent sellers, mortgage brokers and individual borrowers to send data to us securely in an encrypted manner. Real Estate Services In 2008, we established our Real Estate Services segment to provide solutions to the distressed mortgage and real estate markets.  We provide loss mitigation and real estate services primarily on our own long - term mortgage portfolio, including default surveillance, loan modification services, short sale services (where a lender agrees to take less than the balance owed from the borrower), real estate owned (REO) surveillance and disposition services and monitoring, reconciling and reporting services for residential and multifamily mortgage portfolios. The activities and related revenues have declined in recent years, and we expect these revenues to gradually decline over time as our long - term mortgage portfolio declines.  These operations are conducted by IMC. Long - Term Mortgage Portfolio The long - term mortgage portfolio primarily consists of residual interests in the securitization trusts reflected as trust assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets that hold non - conforming mortgage loans originated between 2002 and 2007. Since we are no longer adding new mortgage loans to the long - term mortgage portfolio, the long - term mortgage portfolio continues to decrease and is a smaller component of our overall operating results. 7 Table of Contents Our long - term mortgage portfolio consists of our residual interests in securitizations represented on our consolidated balance sheet as the difference between total trust assets and total trust liabilities. Our long - term mortgage portfolio includes adjustable rate and, to a lesser extent, fixed rate Alt - A single - family residential mortgages and commercial (primarily multifamily residential loans) mortgages that were acquired and originated primarily by our discontinued, non - conforming mortgage lending operations and retained in our long - term portfolio before 2008. Alt - A mortgages are primarily first lien mortgages made to borrowers whose credit was generally within established Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines but have loan characteristics that make them non - conforming under those guidelines. In previous years, we securitized mortgage loans by transferring originated residential single - family mortgage loans and multifamily commercial loans (the ""transferred assets"") into non - recourse bankruptcy remote trusts which in turn issued tranches of bonds to investors supported only by the cash flows of the transferred assets. Because the assets and liabilities in the securitizations are nonrecourse to us, the bondholders cannot look to us for repayment of their bonds in the event of a shortfall. These securitizations were structured to include interest rate derivatives. We retained the residual interest in each trust, and in most cases would perform the master servicing. A trustee and servicer, unrelated to us, was named for each securitization. Cash flows from the loans (the loan payments and liquidation of foreclosed real estate properties) collected by the loan servicer are remitted to us, the master servicer. The master servicer remits payments to the trustee who remits payments to the bondholders (investors). The servicer collects loan payments and performs loss mitigation activities for defaulted loans. These activities include foreclosing on properties securing defaulted loans, which results in REO. Commercial mortgages in our long - term mortgage portfolio are primarily adjustable rate mortgages with initial fixed interest rate periods of two, three, five, seven and ten years that subsequently convert to adjustable rate mortgages (hybrid ARMs), and are primarily secured with multi - family residential real estate. Commercial mortgages have provided greater asset diversification on our balance sheet as borrowers of commercial mortgages typically have higher credit scores and commercial mortgages typically have lower LTVs. Historically, we securitized mortgage loans in the form of collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, which were consolidated and accounted for as secured borrowings for financial statement purposes. Securitized mortgages in the form of real estate mortgage investment conduits, or REMICs, were either consolidated or unconsolidated depending on the design of the securitization structure. We consolidated the variable interest entity, or VIE, as the primary beneficiary of the sole residual interest in each securitization trust where we also performed the master servicing. Amounts consolidated were included in trust assets and liabilities as securitized mortgage collateral, real estate owned, derivative assets, securitized mortgage borrowings and derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2017, our residual interests in securitizations (represented by the difference between total trust assets and total trust liabilities) increased to $17.3 million, compared to $15.7 million at December 31, 2016. Since 2007, we have not added any mortgage loans to our long - term mortgage portfolio. For additional information regarding the long - term mortgage portfolio refer to Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition,"" and Note 10. ""Securitized Mortgage Trusts"" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Master Servicing Until 2007, we were retaining master servicing rights on substantially all of our non - conforming single - family residential and commercial mortgage acquisitions and originations that were sold through securitizations. Since 2008, we have not retained any additional master servicing rights, but have continued to be the master servicer of previously retained master servicing rights. The function of a master servicer includes collecting loan payments from loan servicers and remitting loan payments, less master servicing fees receivable and other fees, to a trustee or other purchaser for each series of mortgage - backed securities or mortgages master serviced. In addition, as master servicer, we monitor compliance with the servicing guidelines and perform or contract with third parties to perform all functions not adequately performed by any loan servicer. The master servicer is also required to advance funds, or cause 8 Table of Contents the loan servicers to advance funds, to cover principal and interest payments not received from borrowers depending on the status of their mortgages, but only to the extent that it is determined that such advances are recoverable either from the borrower or from the liquidation of the property. Master servicing fees are generally 0.03% per annum on the collected unpaid principal balance of the mortgages serviced. As a master servicer, we also earn income or incur expense on principal and interest payments received from borrowers until those payments are remitted to the investors of those mortgages. Fees from the master servicing portfolio have declined significantly due to a decrease in principal balances since the end of 2008, which in turn affects the amount we earn on balances held in custodial accounts. At December 31, 2017, we were the master servicer for approximately 19,100 mortgages with an UPB of approximately $4.9 billion of which $1.1 billion of those loans were 60 or more days delinquent. At December 31, 2017, we were also the master servicer for unconsolidated securitizations (included in the total master servicing portfolio above) totaling approximately $578 million in unpaid principal balance of which $235 million of those loans were 60 or more days delinquent. Fees earned from master servicing are separate from those earned from mortgage servicing which are generated from servicing rights from new originations since 2011. Corporate This segment includes all corporate services groups including information technology, human resources, legal, facilities, accounting, treasury and corporate administration. This corporate services group supports all operating segments. A portion of these costs are allocated to the operating segments based on certain allocation methods. These corporate services groups are centralized to be efficient and avoid any duplicate cost burdens. Specific costs associated with being a publicly traded company are not allocated and remain in this segment. At our corporate headquarters in Irvine, California, we occupy office space under our lease agreement. In January 2016, an amendment to our lease became effective modifying certain terms as well as extending the lease to 2024. The modification of the lease effectively eliminates the shortfall we were recording as lease impairment attributable to the office space we were subletting associated with our previously discontinued operations. The corporate segment also includes debt expense related to the Convertible Notes due in 2020, term financing as well as capital leases. Debt service expense is not allocated and remains in this segment. We have taken advantage of very low financing rates and entered into capital lease arrangements to finance the purchase of equipment, mostly computer equipment, used in all three segments. The interest expense associated with the capital leases is not allocated and remains in this segment. Regulation The U.S. mortgage industry is heavily regulated. Our mortgage lending operations, as well as our real estate services, are subject to federal, state and local laws that regulate and restrict the manner in which we operate in the residential mortgage industry. Plus, mortgage bankers and brokers in our wholesale production channel and correspondents from which we purchase loans are also subject to regulation, which may have an effect on our business and the mortgage loans we are able to fund or acquire. Compliance with regulations in the mortgage industry requires us to incur costs and expenses in our operations. To the extent we, or others with which we conduct business, do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to fines, reimbursements and other penalties. The laws and regulations that we are subject to include the following:  			 		 			 			the Federal Truth - in - Lending Act (known as TILA) and Regulation Z promulgated there under, which require certain disclosures to the borrowers regarding the terms of the loans and require substantial changes in compensation that can be paid to brokers and loan originators;  			 		 			 			the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated there under, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, race, color, sex, religion, marital status, national origin, receipt of public assistance or the exercise of any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, in the extension of credit; 9 Table of Contents  			 		 			 			the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or handicap, in housing - related transactions;  			 		 			 			the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use and reporting of information related to the borrower's credit experience;  			 		 			 			the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act, which regulates credit reporting and use of credit information in making unsolicited offers of credit;  			 		 			 			the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act, which imposes requirements on all lenders with respect to their collection and use of nonpublic financial information and requires them to maintain the security of that information;  			 		 			 			the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (known as RESPA) and Regulation X, promulgated thereunder, outlaws kickbacks that increase the cost of settlement services;  			 		 			 			the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which requires the reporting of public loan data;  			 		 			 			the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Can Spam Act, which regulate commercial solicitations via telephone, fax, and the Internet;  			 		 			 			the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, which preempts certain state usury laws;  			 		 			 			the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982, which preempts certain state lending laws which regulate alternative mortgage transactions;  			 		 			 			the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which prohibits unfair debt collection practices; and  			 		 			 			the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, which establishes national minimum standards for mortgage licensees. In addition, the Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system. The Dodd - Frank Act increased regulation of the mortgage industry, including: generally prohibiting lenders from making residential mortgage loans unless a good faith determination is made of a borrower's creditworthiness based on verified and documented information; requiring the CFPB to enact regulations to help assure that consumers are provided with timely and understandable information about residential mortgage loans that protect them against unfair, deceptive and abusive practices; and requiring federal regulators to establish minimum national underwriting guidelines for residential mortgages that lenders will be allowed to securitize without retaining any of the loans' default risk. Our mortgage lending operations is an approved Housing and Urban Development (HUD) lender, a Ginnie Mae approved issuer and servicer and an approved seller/servicer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As such, we are required to submit annually to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD, as applicable, audited financial statements, or the equivalent, according to the financial reporting requirements of each regulatory entity for its sellers/servicers. Our lending activities are also subject to examination by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, CFPB and state regulatory agencies at any time to assure compliance with applicable regulations, policies and procedures. Also refer to ""Regulatory Risks"" under Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of regulations that may affect us. Competition We operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes, as well as continued consolidation or expansion. Our competitors include banks, thrifts, credit unions, real estate brokerage firms, mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer 10 Table of Contents service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates, lending limits and customer convenience. To compete effectively, we must have a very high level of operational, technological, and managerial expertise, as well as access to capital at a competitive cost. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have access to greater financial resources than we do, which can place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, many of our largest competitors are banks or affiliated with banking institutions, the advantages of which include, but are not limited to, the ability to hold new mortgage loan originations in an investment portfolio and having access to financing with more favorable terms than we do, including lower funding costs with bank deposits as a source of liquidity. Our real estate services segment competes with firms that provide similar services, including loan modification companies, real estate asset management and disposition companies and real estate brokerage firms. Our competitors include mega mortgage servicers, established subprime loan servicers, and newer entrants to the specialty servicing and recovery collections business. Efforts to market our ability to provide real estate services for others is more difficult than many of our competitors because we have not historically provided such services to unrelated third parties, and we are not a rated primary or special servicer of residential mortgage loans as designated by a rating agency. Risk factors, as outlined below, provide additional information related to risks associated with competition in the mortgage industry. Employees As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a total of 588 and 714 employees, respectively. Management believes that relations with our employees are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.","ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Some of the following risk factors relate to a discussion of our assets. For additional information on our asset categories refer to Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"" as well as the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Risks Related To Our Businesses Our long - term success is primarily dependent on our ability to increase the profitability of our mortgage originations. We believe that a key driver of growth of our profitability will be increasing the profitability of our mortgage lending operations. Our success is dependent on many factors such as the documentation and data capture technology, increasing our loan origination operational capacities, increasing our mortgage origination efficiencies, attracting qualified employees, ability to maintain our approvals with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and other investors, ability to increase our mortgage servicing portfolio, the ability to obtain adequate warehouse borrowing capacity, the ability to adequately maintain loan quality and manage the risk of losses from repurchases, the changing regulatory environment for mortgage lending and the ability to fund our originations. If we are unable to generate sufficient net earnings from our mortgage lending operations and real estate services and cash flows from our mortgage portfolio, we may be unable to satisfy our future operating costs and liabilities, including repayment of our debt obligations. A decline in the unpaid principal balance of the servicing portfolio and the related estimated fair value of the MSRs could adversely affect our net earnings, financial condition, future servicing fees and our ability to borrow on our MSR financing facilities. The servicing portfolio and the value of the related MSRs are sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates: 11 Table of Contents  			 		 			 			a decrease in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds which may lead to (i) increased amortization expense; (ii) decrease in servicing fees; and (iii) decrease in the value of our MSRs;  			 		 			 			an increase in interest rates, together with an increase in monthly payments when an adjustable mortgage loan's interest rate adjusts upward from an initial fixed rate or a low introductory rate, may cause increased delinquency, default and foreclosure. Increased mortgage defaults and foreclosures may adversely affect our business as they increase our expenses and reduce the number of mortgages we service; Our servicing portfolio is subject to ""run off"", meaning that mortgage loans serviced by us may be prepaid prior to maturity or repaid through standard amortization of principal. As a result, our ability to maintain the size of our servicing portfolio depends on our ability to retain the right to service the existing residential mortgages or to originate additional mortgages.  Significant ""run off"" could result in decreasing the estimated value of the MSRs, which could have an adverse impact our net earnings. Our MSR financing facilities generally allow us to borrow up to 55% of the estimated fair value of MSRs.  A decline in value of the MSRs could limit our ability to borrow on these facilities.  Limitations on borrowings on these financing facilities imposed by the amount of eligible collateral pledged could affect the borrowing capacity of the facility, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. Our performance may be adversely affected by the performance of parties who service or sub - service our mortgage loans. We contract with third parties for the servicing of our mortgage loans in our long - term mortgage portfolio, for which we are the master servicer, and the servicing portfolio in our mortgage lending operations, however we retain primary responsibility to insure the loans are serviced meeting contractual and regulatory requirements. Our operations, performance and liabilities are subject to risks associated with inadequate or untimely servicing. If a servicer defaults or fails to perform to certain standards then this can be deemed to be a default or failure by us to perform those duties or functions. If we, or our sub - servicers, commit a material breach of our obligations as a servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to damages or termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing rights income. In addition, we may be required to indemnify the investor or securitization trustee against losses from any failure by us, as master servicer or on behalf of the sub - servicer, to perform the servicing obligations properly. If, as a result of a servicer or sub - servicer's failure to perform adequately, we were terminated as servicer by an investor, trustee or master servicer, the value of any servicing or master servicing rights held by us could be adversely affected. Also, this could affect the cash flow generated by our servicing rights portfolio. Poor performance by a sub - servicer may result in greater than expected delinquencies and foreclosures and losses on our mortgage loans or, in the case of our long - term mortgage portfolio, in our resulting exposure to investors, bond holders, bond insurers or others to whom we are responsible for the performance of our loan sub - servicers. As  Master Servicer in our securitizations we are responsible for the duties, responsibilities and actions of the subservicers.    Their actions, or lack thereof, may impose liability upon us from third party claims.  A substantial increase in our delinquency or foreclosure rate could adversely affect our ability to access the capital and secondary markets for our financing needs. With respect to our long - term mortgage portfolio, greater delinquencies would adversely affect the value of our cash flows and residual interests, if any, we hold in connection with that securitization. Mortgage servicing rights are a material asset on our consolidated balance sheets. The value of these rights are dependent upon various factors, including, but not limited to, the adequate performance of the servicing function by our sub - servicer, the responsibilities imposed on us by the investors of our loans for which we hold the servicing rights, interest rates, the cost of our sub - servicers, loan prepayments and delinquencies. As these factors and others vary, the value of our mortgage servicing rights may fluctuate which may affect our ability to meet financial covenants, maintain credit facilities, expand our operations and generate income from our operations. 12 Table of Contents Mortgage market conditions have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition. Volatility in the real estate market, as well as inflation, energy costs, mortgage compliance, geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit, may contribute to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the mortgage markets. The mortgage market has been severely affected by changes in the lending landscape. Previous unprecedented disruptions and deterioration of the mortgage market have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As a result of higher interest rates, a decline in refinancing transactions, current economic conditions, the mortgage regulatory environment and other factors it is projected by some mortgage organizations that mortgage originations during 2018 may be at lower volumes than 2017. As a result we may experience reduced volumes and reduced income unless we are able to garner a greater market share of originations or sufficiently reduce costs. In addition, volatility in mortgage interest rates could cause volatility in the value of our mortgage servicing rights, resulting in volatile or adverse financial results. If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations or to meet or maintain the necessary financial covenant requirements with lenders or satisfy, or obtain waivers from, the continuing covenants, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have significant debt obligations including:  			 		 			 			$25.0 million Convertible Promissory Notes due May 2020;  			 		 			 			$70.0 million revolving debt facilities secured by MSRs of which $35.1 million was outstanding at December 31, 2017;  			 		 			 			Junior Subordinated Notes with an outstanding principal balance of $62.0 million at December 31, 2017; and  			 		 			 			Warehouse facilities with third - party lenders which are secured by and used to fund residential mortgage loans until such loans are sold. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt. If we are unable to generate cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be unfavorable to us or highly dilutive, any of which may be material to the holders of our common stock. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to sell loans timely to repay the warehouse lenders prior to required curtailments, our liquidity may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our credit and warehouse facilities contain covenants, including requirements to maintain a certain minimum net worth, liquidity, litigation judgment thresholds, debt ratios, profitability levels and other customary debt covenants. A breach of the covenants can result in an event of default under these facilities and as such allows the lender to pursue certain remedies, which may constitute a cross default under other agreements. Our principal stockholders beneficially own a large portion of our stock, and accordingly, may have control over stockholder matters and sales may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of February 28, 2018, Todd M. Pickup and Richard H. Pickup and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 16.1% and 26.8%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. Their beneficial ownership includes 465,116 shares and 639,535 shares of our common stock that Todd Pickup and Richard Pickup, respectively, has the right to acquire at any time by converting the outstanding principal balance of Convertible Notes Due 2020, at the initial conversion price of $21.50 per share. As of February 28, 2018, 13 Table of Contents Thomas B. Akin and his respective affiliate beneficially owned approximately 13.3% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders could exercise significant influence over our Company. Such ownership may have the effect of control over substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors. Furthermore, such ownership and control may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our Company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company. We do not expect that these stockholders will vote together as a group. In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by these stockholders, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Historically, we have completed material acquisitions and may in the future look for opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions of businesses and assets. The performance of the businesses and assets we acquire through acquisitions may not match the historical performance of our other assets. Nor can we assure you that the businesses and assets we may acquire will perform at levels meeting our expectations. We may find that we overpaid for the acquired business or assets or that the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision have changed. It may also take several quarters or longer for us to fully integrate newly acquired business and assets into our business, during which period our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected. Further, certain one-time expenses associated with such acquisitions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The risks associated with acquisitions include, among others:  			 		 			 			unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;  			 		 			 			unanticipated incompatibility in lending, purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;  			 		 			 			direct and indirect costs and liabilities;  			 		 			 			not retaining key employees;  			 		 			 			the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns;  			 		 			 			compliance and regulatory scrutiny; and  			 		 			 			goodwill impairment. The integration process can be complicated and time consuming and could potentially be disruptive to our other operations. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within our expected timeframe. Through acquisitions, we may enter into business lines in which we have not previously operated. Such acquisitions could require additional integration costs and efforts, including significant time from senior management. We may not be able to achieve the synergies we anticipate from acquired businesses, and we may not be able to grow acquired businesses in the manner we anticipate. In fact, the businesses we acquire could decrease in size, even if the integration process is successful. Further, acquisition prices can fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices that we considered to be acceptable, and we expect that we will experience this condition in the future. In addition, in order to finance an acquisition we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or we could raise additional equity capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders. The timing of closing of our acquisitions is often uncertain. We have in the past and may in the future experience delays in closing our acquisitions, or certain tranches of them. For example, we and the applicable seller are often required to obtain certain contractual and regulatory consents as a prerequisite to closing, such as the consents of state regulators, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Accordingly, even if we and the applicable 14 Table of Contents seller are efficient and proactive, the actions of third parties can impact the timing under which such consents are obtained. We and the applicable seller may not be able to obtain all of the required consents, which may mean that we are unable to acquire all of the assets that we wish to acquire. Regulators may have questions relating to aspects of our acquisitions and we may be required to devote time and resources responding to those questions. It is also possible that we will expend considerable resources in the pursuit of an acquisition that, ultimately, either does not close or is terminated. If our goodwill, other intangible assets or deferred tax assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings which might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. As required by accounting rules, we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of December 31 or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include declines in our profitability, a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry. As of December 31, 2017,  we had approximately $104.6 million of goodwill and $21.6 million of intangible assets, which could be subject to impairment in future periods. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, if there is a change to the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, then we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a material increase in our tax rate and an adverse impact on future operating results. As a result of a reduction in projected future utilization and the recent change in tax rates, we recorded a $17.8 million decrease in our deferred tax assets.  Our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, totaled approximately $6.6 million at December 31, 2017. Our hedging strategies implemented by our mortgage lending operations may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with the market movement of interest rates. We use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks in our mortgage lending operations, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. When interest rates change, we expect to record a gain or loss on derivatives which would be offset by an inverse change in the value of mortgage loans held for sale, our held mortgage servicing rights and interest rate lock commitments. We cannot assure you, however, that our use of derivatives will offset the risks related to changes in interest rates. There have been periods, and it is likely that there will be periods in the future, during which we will not have offsetting gains or losses in mortgage loans, mortgage servicing rights and interest rate lock commitment values after accounting for our derivative financial instruments. The derivative financial instruments we select may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risk. In addition, the nature and timing of hedging transactions may influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and recorded transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risk and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. We cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses. Regulatory laws affecting our operations, or interpretations of them, may affect our mortgage lending operations. Existing laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and changes thereto or to the way they are interpreted can affect whether and to what extent we may be able to expand our mortgage lending activities and compliance with such requirements could expose us to fines, penalties or licensing restrictions that could affect our operations. Many states and local governments and the Federal government have enacted or may enact laws or regulations that restrict or prohibit some provisions in some programs or businesses that we currently 15 Table of Contents participate in or plan to participate in the future. As such, we cannot be sure that in the future we will be able to engage in activities that were similar to those we engaged or participated in in the past thereby limiting our ability to commence new operations. As a result, we might be at a competitive disadvantage which would affect our operations and profitability. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the mortgage industry that generally regulate interest rates and other charges, require certain disclosures, and require applicable licensing. In addition, other state and local laws, public policy and general principles of equity relating to the protection of consumers, unfair and deceptive practices and debt collection practices may apply to the origination, servicing and collection of our loans. Violations of certain provisions of these federal and state laws and regulations may limit our ability to collect all or part of the principal of or interest on the loans and in addition could subject us to damages, could result in the mortgagors rescinding the loans whether held by us or subsequent holders of the loans, or could cause us to repurchase the loan and thereby suffer a loss on the transaction. In addition, such violations could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by state and federal regulators and cause us to be in default under our credit and repurchase lines and could result in the loss of licenses held by us. The regulatory changes in loan originator compensation, qualified mortgage requirements and other regulatory restrictions may put us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors. Since some banks and financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory changes as mortgage lenders, they could have an advantage over independent mortgage lenders. As a result of the nature of our operations, our capital, costs, source of funds and other similar factors may affect our ability to maintain and grow lending. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has implemented rules and interpretations with strict residential mortgage loan compliance and underwriting standards as called for in the Dodd - Frank Act. The Act imposes significant liability for violation of those underwriting standards, and offers certain protection from that liability only for loans that comply with tight limitations and that do not contain certain alternative features (like balloon payments or interest only provisions). Those requirements and subsequent changes may affect our ability to originate residential mortgage loans or the profitability of those operations. Additionally, the Mortgage Reform and Anti - Predatory Lending Act (""Mortgage Act"") imposes a number of additional requirements on lenders and servicers of residential mortgage loans by amending certain existing provisions and adding new sections to TILA, RESPA, and other federal laws. This includes the TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosure requirements and new disclosure requirements, fee limitations and timing requirements in most of our loan products. The Mortgage Act also broadly prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, and knowingly or recklessly providing substantial assistance to a covered person in violation of that prohibition. The penalties for noncompliance with any of these laws are also significantly increased by the Mortgage Act, which could lead to an increase in lawsuits against mortgage lenders and servicers or could lead to fines, penalties licensing restrictions or la loss of licenses which could restrict our ability to expand or continue lending in certain states. Our share prices have been and may continue to be volatile and the trading of our shares may be limited. The market price of our securities has been volatile. We cannot guarantee that a consistently active trading market for our securities will continue. In addition, there can be no assurances that such markets will continue or that any shares which may be purchased may be sold without incurring a loss. Any such market price variation of our shares may not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value, and may not be indicative of the market price for the shares in the future. The market price of our securities is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be significantly affected by factors including:  			 		 			 			unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results;  			 		 			 			general market and mortgage industry conditions;  			 		 			 			mortgage and real estate fees;  			 		 			 			delinquencies and defaults on outstanding mortgages; 16 Table of Contents  			 		 			 			loss severities on loans and REO;  			 		 			 			prepayments on mortgages;  			 		 			 			the regulatory environment and results of our mortgage originations;  			 		 			 			mark to market adjustments related to the fair value of loans held -  for - sale, mortgage servicing rights, long - term debt and derivatives;  			 		 			 			interest rates; and  			 		 			 			litigation. During 2017, our common stock reached an intra - day high sales price of $17.40 on May 10, 2017, and an intra - day low sales price of $9.92 on December 27, 2017.   As of March 1, 2018, our stock price closed at $9.43 per share. In addition, significant price and volume fluctuations in the stock market have particularly affected the market prices for the securities of mortgage companies such as ours. Furthermore, general conditions in the mortgage industry may adversely affect the market price of our securities. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our securities. If our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of security analysts or investors in a future quarter, the market price of our securities could also be materially adversely affected and we may experience difficulty in raising capital. Growth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure. For our operations to continue to grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to meet the demands and maintain efficiency of our business. Growth could strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. Managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, our business would be harmed. Loss of our approvals with, or the potential limitation or wind - down of, the role Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play in the residential mortgage - backed security (MBS) market could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. We originate loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, government insured or guaranteed loans, such as FHA, VA and USDA loans, and loans eligible for Ginnie Mae securities issuance. We also service loans sold to the GSEs and other investors. We believe that having the ability to both sell loans directly to these agencies and issue Ginnie Mae securities gives us an advantage in the overall mortgage origination market. The government may limit over time the role of the GSEs in guaranteeing mortgages and purchasing mortgage loans, as well as proposals to implement reforms relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of a loan that the GSEs can purchase, phasing - in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, changing underwriting standards, and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. The GSEs may also limit the amount of loans a company can sell to them based upon the company's net worth or the performance of loans sold to them. This could negatively impact our financial condition, net earnings and growth. We also service loans on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as loans that have been delivered into securitization programs sponsored by Ginnie Mae in connection with the issuance of agency guaranteed mortgage - backed securities. These entities establish the base service fee to compensate us for servicing loans as well as the assessment of fines and penalties that may be imposed upon us for failing to meet servicing standards. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform regarding the GSEs and the home mortgage market, as well as any effect on Impac's business operations and financial results, are uncertain. If the agencies cease to 17 Table of Contents exist, wind down, or otherwise significantly change their business operations or if we lose our approved seller/servicer status with the GSEs, the GSE's limit the amount of loans we can sell to them, or we otherwise are unable to sell loans to them there could be a material adverse effect on our mortgage lending operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our product offering may expose us to a higher risk of delinquencies, regulatory risks, foreclosures and losses adversely affecting our earnings and financial condition. We originate and acquire various types of residential mortgage products, which include NonQM and non-conforming loan products.  Unlike Qualified Mortgages, NonQM loans do not benefit from a presumption that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. We understand that these types of products may be relatively new in today's marketplace and while we have taken great steps to try and mitigate any exposure and insure that we have made a reasonable determination that the borrowers will have the ability to repay the loan, this type of product does have increased risk and exposure to litigation and claims of borrowers. If, however, we were to make a loan as to which we did not satisfy the regulatory standards for ascertaining the borrower's ability to repay the loan, the consequences could include giving the borrower a defense to repayment of the loan, which may prevent us from collecting interest and principal on that loan. These are mortgages that generally did not qualify for purchase by government - sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Credit risks associated with all these mortgages may be greater than those associated with conforming mortgages. Mortgages made to these borrowers may entail a higher risk of delinquency and higher losses than mortgages made to borrowers who utilize conventional mortgage sources. Delinquency, foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. The actual risk of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on mortgages made to these borrowers may be higher under current economic conditions than those in the past. Additionally, the combination of different underwriting criteria and higher rates of interest leads to greater risk, including higher prepayment rates and higher delinquency rates and /or credit losses. These also include loans that are interest only. If there is a decline in real estate values, as previously seen, borrowers may default on these types of loans since they have not reduced their principal balances, which, therefore, could exceed the value of their property. In addition, a reduction in property values would also cause an increase in the loan - to - value (LTV) ratio for that loan which could have the effect of reducing the value of the property collateralized by that loan, reducing the borrowers' equity in their homes to a level that would increase the risk of default. If we have sold the loan or the servicing of the loan, this may violate the representations and warranties we made in such a sale and impose upon us an obligation to repurchase the loan. In addition, if we expand our products beyond residential mortgages to other types of consumer lending products, we may encounter additional risks associated with these products. A failure in or breach of our technology infrastructure, or the systems operated by our third - party service providers, to protect confidential information of borrowers could damage our reputation and substantially harm our business. We, or our third party service providers, maintain certain confidential information relating to our borrowers for mortgage loans. If the information is maintained electronically, we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to affect secure transmission of confidential information, including personal information and credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer transaction data. We may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break - ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential borrower data. The possession and use of personal information in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require notification to customers of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to operate our mortgage lending business. A failure in or breach of the security of our information systems, or those of our service providers, could result in damage to our reputation and harm our business. Our ability to utilize our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes may be limited. At the end of our 2017 taxable year, we had federal and California net operating loss (NOL) carry - forwards of approximately $619.9 million and $431.0 million, respectively. Federal NOLs begin to expire 18 Table of Contents in 2027 and California NOLs begin to expire in 2028.  We may not generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to be able to realize fully the tax benefits of our NOL carry - forwards. Although, under existing tax rules, we are generally allowed to use those NOL carry - forwards to offset taxable income in subsequent taxable years, our ability to use those NOL carry - forwards to offset income may be severely limited to the extent that we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These provisions could also limit our ability to deduct certain losses (built - in losses) we recognize after an ownership change with respect to assets we own at the time of the ownership change. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in our stock by more than 50% over a three - year period. In addition, the generation of taxable income from cancellation of debt may further reduce the NOL. Any limitation on our NOL carry - forwards that could be used to offset taxable income would adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow, as and when we become profitable. In 2013, we enacted a NOL rights plan, approved by stockholders, which is designed to mitigate the risk of losing net operating loss carry - forwards and certain other tax attributes from being limited in reducing future income taxes.    On July 19, 2016, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Rights Plan extending the expiration date to September 2, 2019. An NOL rights plan does not prevent a change of control transaction but instead strongly discourages it. We may become, and in some cases are, a defendant in lawsuits, some of which may be class action matters, and we may not prevail in these matters; We recently received an adverse ruling which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Individual and class action lawsuits and regulatory actions alleging improper marketing practices, abusive loan terms and fees, disclosure violations and other matters are risks faced by all mortgage originators. We are a defendant in purported class actions pending in different states and could be named in other matters. Some of the actions allege generally that the loan originator (whether or not Impac) improperly charged fees in violation of various state lending or consumer protection laws in connection with mortgages that we acquired while others allege that our lending or servicing practice was a statutory violation, an unlawful business practice, an unfair business practice or a breach of a contract. They generally seek unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs and expenses and rescission of the mortgages, as well as a return of any improperly collected fees.  We will incur defense costs and other expenses in connection with the lawsuits, and we cannot assure you that the ultimate outcome of these or other actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition to the expense and burden incurred in defending any of these actions and any damages that we may suffer, our management's efforts and attention may be diverted from the ordinary business operations in order to address these claims. We may also issue shares of common stock to settle outstanding obligations and liabilities which could also affect the market price of our common stock. Plus, we may be deemed in default of our warehouse lines if a judgment for money that exceeds specified thresholds is rendered against us. If the final resolution of this litigation is unfavorable to us in any of these actions, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows might be materially adversely affected. We are subject to a purported class action lawsuit relating to our Series B Preferred Stock in which holders are seeking cumulative dividends, unpaid dividends, certain restrictions on our actions, including the ability to pay common stock dividends, and the election of two directors by the preferred holders. In December 2017, we received an unfavorable court ruling that the rights, preferences and terms of the Series B Preferred Stock prior to the 2009 closing of the tender offer and consent solicitation remain in effect, that the 2009 amendments were ineffective, and the 2004 rights remain in effect.  We intend to appeal the decision.  If not reversed, the decision affects the rights of the Series B holders to receive, when and as authorized by the Board of Directors, cumulative preferential cash dividends at a rate of 9.375% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to a fixed annual amount of $2.34375 per shares) payable on a quarterly basis.   Further, plaintiffs have presented post-decision arguments that Impac is required to pay three quarters of dividends to Series B stockholders and to accrue all unpaid dividends.  In addition, under the Series B Preferred Stock terms prior to the 2009 amendments, whenever dividends are in arrears for six or more quarters, whether or not consecutive, the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to call a special meeting for the election of two additional directors. The 2004 rights also provide for certain other voting rights prior to amendment of any provisions of our charter so as to materially and adversely affect the Series B Preferred Stock,  or approve a merger or similar transaction unless the Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding and materially unchanged.  We would also be prohibited from paying any dividend on our common stock until dividends on 19 Table of Contents the Series B Preferred Stock are paid in full.  Appeal of the court ruling will continue the cost and expense related to defending this lawsuit and diversion of our management's efforts and attention from ordinary business operations in order to address the claims.  This court ruling and the possible judgment may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Issuances of additional shares of our common stock may adversely affect its market price and significantly dilute stockholders. In order to support our business objectives, we may raise capital through the sale of equity or convertible securities. In April 2017, we sold 4,423,381 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering and during 2016 we sold 3,450,000 shares of common stock in a public offering as well as issued an aggregate of 361,429 shares pursuant to an ""At-the Market"" offering.  The issuance or sale, or the proposed sale, of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock or other outstanding securities. We do not know the actual or perceived effect of these issuances, the timing of any offerings or issuances of securities, the potential dilution of the book value or earnings per share of our securities then outstanding and the effect on the market price of our securities then outstanding. We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and we may be restricted in paying dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future as we intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth. In addition, our existing and any future warehouse facilities may contain covenants prohibiting dividend payments upon an occurrence of a default or otherwise. Furthermore, if we do not succeed in appealing and reversing an adverse judgment on the purposed class action relating to our Series B Preferred stock and we are required to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred  stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock until such preferred stock dividends are paid. As a result, you should not rely on an investment in our stock if you require dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our stock may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Representations and warranties made by us in our loan sales, servicing rights sales and securitizations may subject us to liability. In connection with our loan and/or servicing rights sales to third parties and our prior securitizations, we transferred mortgages and/or servicing rights to third parties or, to a lesser extent, into a trust in exchange for cash and, in the case of a securitized mortgage, residual certificates issued by the trust. The trustee, purchaser, bondholder, guarantor or other entities involved in the sales or issuance of the securities (which may include bond insurers) may have recourse to us with respect to the breach of the representations and warranties made by us at the time such mortgages and/or servicing rights are transferred or when the securities are sold. We attempt to mitigate the potential recourse from such purchasers by seeking remedies from correspondent sellers and wholesale brokers who originated the mortgages if we did not originate the loan. However, many of the entities we acquired loans from in the past are no longer in business or may not be able to financially cover the losses. Furthermore, if we discover, prior to the sale or transfer of a loan, that there is any fraud or misrepresentation with respect to the mortgage and the originator fails to repurchase the mortgage, then we may not be able to sell the mortgage or we may have to sell the mortgage at a discount. Changes in the timing, processes and procedures of our primary investors' review of loans which they purchase from us may affect the number of loans that are rejected, the timing of our loan sales, or the frequency of repurchase demands issued to us. Also, similar changes by mortgage insurers who agree to insure loans may also affect the frequency and timing of our loan sales. As a result, the effectiveness of our loan sales, our repurchase reserves and our profitability may be affected as we may have to sell loans at a discount. Litigation in the mortgage industry related to securitizations against issuers, sellers, servicers, originators, underwriters and others may adversely affect our business operations. As defaults, delinquencies, foreclosures, and losses in the real estate market continue, there have been lawsuits by various investors, insurers, underwriters and others against various participants in securitizations, such as sponsors, depositors, underwriters, servicers and loan sellers. Some lawsuits have alleged that the 20 Table of Contents mortgage loans had origination defects, that there were misrepresentations made about the mortgage loans and that the parties failed to properly disclose the quality of the mortgage loans or repurchase defective loans wherein servicing standards were not maintained or that there were other misrepresentations or false representations. Historically, we both securitized and sold mortgage loans to third parties that may have been deposited or included in pools for securitizations. As a result, we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against claims and litigation and we may be required to pay settlement costs, damages, penalties or other charges which could adversely affect our financial results. Loss of our current executive officers or other key management could significantly harm our business. We depend on the diligence, skill and experience of our senior executives. We believe that our future results will also depend in part upon our attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified management. We seek to compensate our executive officers, as well as other employees, through competitive salaries, bonuses and other incentive plans, but there can be no assurance that these programs will allow us to retain key management executives or hire new key employees. The loss of senior executive officers and key management could have a material adverse effect on our operations because other officers may not have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. The loss of, and changes in, key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The geographic concentration of our mortgages increases our exposure to risks in those areas. We do not set limitations on the percentage of mortgages composed of properties located in any one area (whether by state, zip code or other geographic measure). Concentration in any one area increases our exposure to the economic and natural hazard risks associated with that area. A majority of our mortgage acquisitions and originations and mortgages held in our long - term mortgage portfolio are secured by properties in California and, to a lesser extent, Florida, Washington and Arizona. These states have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, economic downturns and California and Florida have also suffered the effects of certain natural hazards. During past economic downturns, real estate values in California and Florida have decreased drastically, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, Florida is among several states with higher than average costs for investors in circumstances of mortgage default and foreclosure, since the foreclosure process takes significantly longer than average. Accordingly, to the extent the mortgages we originate or are held in our long - term mortgage portfolio experience defaults or foreclosures in that area, we may be exposed to higher losses. Furthermore, if borrowers are not insured for natural disasters, which are typically not covered by standard hazard insurance policies, then they may not be able to repair the property or may stop paying their mortgages if the property is damaged. This would cause increased foreclosures and decrease our ability to recover losses on properties affected by such disasters. This would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our vendor relationships subject us to a variety of risks. We have significant vendors that, among other things, provide us with financial, technology and other services to support our mortgage loan servicing and origination businesses. Some of these outsourced services, such as technology, could have a material effect on our business and operations if our third party provider was unable to, or failed to, properly provide such services.  With respect to vendors engaged to perform activities required by servicing criteria, we have elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the applicable vendor and are required to have procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor, including but not limited to, monitoring compliance with our predetermined policies and procedures and monitoring the status of payment processing operations. In the event that a vendor's activities do not comply with the servicing criteria, it could negatively impact our servicing agreements. In addition, if our current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more vendor bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may incur 21 Table of Contents significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in April 2012 the CFPB issued CFPB Bulletin 2012 - 03 which states that supervised banks and non - banks could be held liable for actions of their service providers. As a result, we could be exposed to liability, CFPB enforcement actions or other administrative penalties if the vendors with whom we do business violate consumer protection laws. We may not be able to access financing sources on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to implement and operate our business as planned. Future financing sources may include borrowings in the form of credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, structured financing arrangements, public and private equity and debt issuances and derivative instruments, in addition to transactions or asset specific funding arrangements. Our access to sources of financing depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control, including general market conditions, resources and policies or lenders. Under current market conditions, many forms of structured financing arrangements are generally unavailable, which also in the past has limited our ability to borrow under short term warehouse and repurchase agreements that are intended to be refinanced by such financings. In addition, if regulatory capital requirements imposed on our private lenders change, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. In general, this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity. Consequently, the expansion of our mortgage lending operations may be dictated by the cost and availability of financing, specifically warehouse facilities. Depending on market conditions at the relevant time, we may have to rely more heavily on additional equity issuances, which may be dilutive to our shareholders, or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations and future business opportunities. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms (including, without limitation, cost and term) at the desired times, or at all, which could negatively affect our results of operations. If our access to such funds are restricted or are on terms that are materially changed, we may not be able to continue those operations which may affect our income and loan origination volumes. If we are forced to liquidate, we may have few unpledged assets for distribution to unsecured creditors or equity holders. In the event we are forced to liquidate, the majority of our assets is either collateral for specific borrowings or pledged as collateral for secured liabilities. We may have few remaining assets available for unsecured creditors and equity holders. If we fail to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud, which could cause current and potential stockholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting, adversely affect the trading price of our securities or harm our operating results. Effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. We cannot be certain that our efforts to improve or maintain our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures will be successful or that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation or other effective improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could harm our operating results, or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to adequately establish or maintain our internal control over financial reporting, our external auditors will not be able to issue an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In the past, we have reported, and may discover in the future, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities or affect our ability to access the capital markets and could result in regulatory proceedings against us by, among others, the SEC. In addition, a material weakness in internal control over 22 Table of Contents financial reporting, which may lead to deficiencies in the preparation of financial statements, could lead to litigation claims against us. The defense of any such claims may cause the diversion of management's attention and resources, and we may be required to pay damages if any such claims or proceedings are not resolved in our favor. Any litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses or cause delays in our public reporting. Such events could harm our business, affect our ability to raise capital and adversely affect the trading price of our securities. Provisions in our charter documents and Maryland law, as well as our NOL Rights Plan, impose limitations that may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party. Our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include, among other things, advance notice for raising business issues or making nominations at meetings and blank check preferred stock that allows our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with rights and terms as our board of directors may determine, including rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to our common stock. We are also subject to certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, which could delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the price for their common stock or may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. This includes the ""business combinations"" statute that prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and ""interested stockholders,"" which is any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our then - outstanding voting stock for a period of five years unless the board of directors approved the transaction prior to the party's becoming an interested stockholder. The five - year period runs from the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder. The law also requires a super majority stockholder vote for such transactions after the end of the five - year period. Maryland law also provides that ""control shares"" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two - thirds of the shares eligible to vote. The control share acquisition statute would not apply to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if we were a party to the transaction. The control share acquisition statute could have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders' best interests. We have also adopted a Tax Benefits Preservations Rights Agreement, also known as an NOL rights plan, pursuant to which each share of common stock also has a ""right"" attached to it. Although the NOL rights plan was adopted to help preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits, including those generated by net operating losses, it also has the effect of deterring or delaying an acquisition of our Company by a third party. The rights are not exercisable except upon the occurrence of certain takeover - related events - most importantly, the acquisition by a third party (the ""Acquiring Person"") of more than 4.99% of our outstanding voting shares. Once triggered, the rights entitle the stockholders, other than the Acquiring Person, to certain ""flip - in"", ""flip - over"" and exchange rights. The effect of triggering the rights is to expose the Acquiring Person to severe dilution of its ownership interest, as the shares of our common stock (or any surviving corporation) are offered to all of the stockholders other than the Acquiring Person at a steep discount to their market value.  On July 19, 2016, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Rights Plan extending the expiration date to September 2, 2019. We have in the past, and may in the future, grant waivers to the limitations imposed by our Tax Benefits Preservations Rights Agreement.    This may effect the holdings of those shareholders who obtained the waivers and may affect the protection of, and hence the ability to make use of, our NOL's.","ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain certain forward - looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Market Conditions The U.S. economy continued to grow during 2017. U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an estimated annual rate of 2.3 percent in 2017, higher than 2016's GDP annual growth rate, while inflation in 2017 remained subdued. In December 2017, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) increased short-term interest rates by 25 basis points, the third such rate increase during the year, and many believe the FRB will increase short-term interest rates further during 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the FRB also began reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. These actions by the FRB will likely cause longer term interest rates to rise over time. The U.S. economy added approximately 2.2 million jobs during 2017 and the total unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent at December 2017 as compared with 4.7 percent at December 2016. While the U.S. economy continued to grow in 2017, economic uncertainty concerning the outlook and the future economic environment exists despite continued improvements in many segments of the global economy. In addition, on-going geopolitical events and the implications of those events could potentially impact the capital markets and trade further adding to global uncertainty. The sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. These conditions in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy, geopolitical concerns and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2018 and beyond. 28 Table of Contents Selected Financial Results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 For the Three Months Ended  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						For

Status of Operations For the year ended 2017, net loss was  $31.5 million, or $1.62 per diluted common share as compared to net earnings of $46.7 million, or $3.31 per diluted common share in 2016 and net earnings of $80.8 million, or $6.40 per diluted common share in 2015.  Adjusted Operating (loss) income (as defined below) was $29.0 million, or $1.49 per diluted common share for 2017, as compared to income of $96.9 million, or $6.52 per diluted common share in 2016, and income of $33.5 million, or $2.56 per diluted common share in 2015. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net loss  was  $44.9 million, or $2.14 per diluted common share as compared to net earnings of $16.9 million, or $1.00 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016, and net earnings of $2.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2017.  Adjusted operating loss was $31.1 million, or $1.48 per diluted common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to income of $23.9 million, or $1.37 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016, and income of $114 thousand, or $0.01 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2017. Operating (loss) income, excluding the changes in contingent consideration (adjusted operating (loss) income), which is not considered an accounting principle generally accepted in the United States of America (non-GAAP) financial measurement; see the discussion and reconciliation on non-GAAP financial measures below. Net (loss) earnings include fair value adjustments for changes in the contingent consideration, long-term debt and net trust assets. The contingent consideration is related to the CashCall Mortgage (CCM) acquisition transaction, while the other fair value adjustments are related to our legacy portfolio. These fair value adjustments are non-cash items and are not related to current operating results.  Although we are required to record change in fair value and accretion of the contingent consideration, management believes operating income excluding contingent consideration changes and the related accretion is more useful to discuss our ongoing and future operations. 29 Table of Contents We calculate adjusted operating (loss) income excluding changes in contingent consideration and operating (loss) income excluding changes in contingent consideration per share as performance measures, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures, to further aid our investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them among periods. Operating income (loss) excluding changes in contingent consideration and operating (loss) income excluding changes in contingent consideration per share exclude certain items that we do not consider part of our core operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings before income taxes, net earnings or diluted earnings per share (EPS) prepared in accordance with GAAP.

convertible debt interest expense, net of tax, is included for calculating diluted EPS and is excluded for purposes of reconciling GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted adjusted operating income (loss) per share. Net (loss) earnings and adjusted operating (loss)  income primarily decreased due to the $174.9 million decline in gain on sale revenues.  Origination volumes declined 45% in 2017 to $7.1 billion from $12.9 billion in 2016, and gain on sale margins declined 20% to 191 bps in 2017 from 241 bps in 2016 resulting in gain on sale revenues declining 56% to $136.1 million in 2017 from $311.0 million in 2016. Offsetting the decline in gain on sale revenues was an increase in servicing fees, net and decrease in operating expenses.  The mortgage servicing portfolio increased 32% to $16.3 billion at the end of 2017 from $12.4 billion at the end of 2016, resulting in an increase in servicing fees, net of 132% to $31.9 million in 2017 from $13.7 million in 2016. Additionally, personnel expense decreased $34.9 million to $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in commission expense due to a decrease in loan originations as well as staff reductions made in 2017.  Due to the decline in origination volumes in 2017, we made staff reductions, which reduced average headcount 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.  As we continue to more closely align operating and staffing levels to origination volumes, we have  continued to right size the organization into 2018. Net (loss) earnings was also affected by an increase in income tax expense and changes in the estimated fair value of long term debt and net trust assets.  Income tax expense increased by $19.0 million in 2017 to $20.1 million from $1.1 million in 2016 is primarily due to a reduction in future utilization of the deferred tax assets and changes in tax rates due to the Tax Act re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at end of 2017.  The change in estimated fair value of long-term debt and net trust assets resulted in a favorable change in other income (expense) of $18.3 million to $6.3 million in 2017 from expense of $12.0 million in 2016. Summary Highlights  			 		 			 			Mortgage servicing portfolio increased to $16.3 billion at December 31, 2017 as compared to 30 Table of Contents $15.7 billion at September 30, 2017 and $12.4 billion at December 31, 2016.  			 		 			 			Servicing fees, net increased to $31.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $13.7 million during 2016 and $6.1 million in 2015.  			 		 			 			Mortgage servicing rights increased to $154.4 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $159.0 million at September 30, 2017 and $131.5 million at December 31, 2016.  			 		 			 			NonQM mortgage origination volumes increased to $891.2 million in 2017 as compared to $289.6 in 2016.  			 		 			 			Issued 4,423,381 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering at a price of $12.66 per share generating proceeds of approximately $55.5 million.  			 		 			 			Entered into MSR financing facilities of up to  $70.0 million and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the Term Financing, which had a higher interest rate, thus reducing interest expense. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a more detailed description.  			 		 			 			In our long - term mortgage portfolio, the residual interests generated cash flows of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $12.7 million in 2017, as compared to $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $8.1 million in 2016.  			 		 			 			Exchanged $8.5 million of trust preferred securities, at a discount to par, for 412,264 shares of common stock. Mortgage Lending During the year ended 2017,  total originations decreased 45% to $7.1 billion as compared to $12.9 billion in 2016 and $9.3 billion in 2015.  In 2017, retail originations were still the main driver of total originations representing 65% or $4.6 billion of total originations.  For the fourth quarter of 2017,  our total originations decreased to $1.7 billion, a 47%  decrease as compared to $3.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016.  The decrease in originations from 2016 was a result of higher interest rates throughout 2017 as compared to the historically low interest rate environment the previous year, causing a sharp drop in refinance volume.

Originating conventional and government - insured loans and having the ability to sell loans direct to GSEs and issue Ginnie Mae securities is a critical aspect to our business with regard to products, pricing, operational efficiencies and overall recruitment of high quality loan originators. As interest rates rise, non-agency originations will become a more significant portion of our originations. In a higher interest rate environment, we believe the non-agency loan product becomes a more desirable product, as it caters more towards the purchase money market in that its guidelines allow for more qualified borrowers to be approved, which will reduce our dependency on the refinance market.  We believe this product will also help in expanding the volumes in our correspondent and wholesale channels. We continue to believe there is an underserved mortgage market for borrowers with good credit who may not meet the qualified mortgage (QM) guidelines set out by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). NonQM borrowers generally have a good credit history but income documentation that does not allow them to qualify for an agency loan, such as a self-employed borrower. We have established strict lending guidelines, including determining the prospective borrowers' ability to repay the mortgage, which we believe will keep delinquencies and foreclosures at acceptable levels. We continue to refine our guidelines to expand our reach to the underserved market of credit worthy borrowers who can fully document and substantiate an ability to repay mortgage loans, but unable to obtain financing through traditional programs (QM loans), for example self-employed borrowers. In 2016,  we rebranded our NonQM loan programs as ""The Intelligent NonQM Mortgage"", to better communicate our NonQM loan value proposition to consumers, brokers, sellers and investors.  In conjunction with these products, we have established investor relationships that provides us with an exit strategy for these nonconforming loans.    In 2017, our NonQM origination volume was $891.2 million with an average FICO of 723 and a weighted average LTV of 64%. In 2017, NonQM and government-insured originations represented approximately 41% of total originations, as compared to just 16% of total originations in 2016. In 2017, the retail channel accounted for 32% of NonQM originations while the wholesale and correspondent channels accounted for 68% of NonQM production.  In 2016, the retail channel accounted for just 19% of NonQM originations, while the wholesale and correspondent channels accounted for 81% of NonQM production. For the year ended December 31, 2017, refinance volume decreased $5.9 billion or approximately 53% as compared to 2016. The decrease was the result of rising mortgage interest rates at the end of 2016 and throughout 2017.  To help mitigate against reduced refinance volumes with the increase in mortgage interest rates, we have been focusing on opportunities to increase our origination of purchase money loans,  expand our NonQM and government-insured origination volumes and increase our geographic footprint of our origination platform. 32 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31,  				 			 					 						(in millions) 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						   				 				 					 						2017 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						% 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2016 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						% 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2015 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						% 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Refinance 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 5,336.5 				 				 					 						  				 				 75 				 				 					 						%   				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 11,259.9 				 				 					 						  				 				 87 				 				 					 						% 				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 7,520.2 				 				 					 						  				 				 81 				 				 					 						% 				 			 					 						Purchase 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 1,775.2 				 				 					 						  				 				 25 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 1,664.3 				 				 					 						  				 				 13 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 1,738.8 				 				 					 						  				 				 19 				 				 					 						% 				 			 					 						Total originations 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 7,111.7 				 				 					 						  				 				 100 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 12,924.2 				 				 					 						  				 				 100 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 9,259.0 				 				 					 						  				 				 100 				 				 					 						% As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately 977 approved wholesale relationships with mortgage brokerage companies and are approved to lend in 47 states.

At December 31 2017, the mortgage servicing portfolio increased to $16.3 billion as compared to $12.4 billion at December 31, 2016.  The increase was due to a shift in our strategy in 2016 to retain our mortgage servicing as well as initiating a retention program to recapture portfolio runoff during the low interest rate environment.  During 2017, we have continued with our strategy of growing the mortgage servicing portfolio. During 2017, the mortgage servicing portfolio increased due to servicing retained loan sales of $6.1 billion in UPB as well as a purchase of approximately $570.0 million in UPB of MSR. As a result, the UPB of our mortgage servicing portfolio increased 32% to $16.3 billion as of December 31, 2017.  The servicing portfolio generated net servicing income of $31.9 million, $13.7 million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Delinquencies within the servicing portfolio have increased slightly but remain low at 0.81% for 60+ days delinquent as of December 31, 2017 as compared to 0.25% as of December 31, 2016 and 0.43 % as of December 31, 2015.  With the acquisition of MSRs in the second quarter of 2017, we added Specialized Loan Servicing LLC as a subservicer in addition to our current subservicer LoanCare, LLC. During 2017, our warehouse borrowing capacity increase from $925.0 million to $960.0 million. At December 31, 2017, we had six warehouse lender relationships. In addition to funding our mortgage loan originations, we also use a portion of our warehouse borrowing capacity to provide re - warehouse facilities to our customers, correspondent sellers and other small mortgage banking companies. During 2017, our outstanding commitments to our customers was  $123.0 million. By leveraging our re - warehousing division, we hope to increase the capture rate of our approved correspondent sellers business as well as expand our active customer base to include new customers seeking warehouse lines. Real Estate Services We provide portfolio loss mitigation and real estate services including real estate owned (REO) surveillance and disposition services, default surveillance and loss recovery services, short sale and real estate 33 Table of Contents brokerage services, portfolio monitoring and reporting services. The source of revenue for this segment is primarily from the long - term mortgage portfolio, along with a small number of third party clients as well. The real estate services segment continues to be profitable and posted net earnings of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2016. As the long - term mortgage portfolio continues to decline, we expect real estate services and the related revenues to decline. Long - Term Mortgage Portfolio The long - term mortgage portfolio primarily includes a) the residual interests in securitizations, b) master servicing rights from the securitizations and c) long - term debt. Although we have seen some stabilization and improvement in defaults, and a recent improvement in residual cash flows, the portfolio is expected to continue to suffer losses and may continue for the foreseeable future.  Such losses have been included in estimating the fair value of the related securitized mortgage collateral and borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our residual interest in securitizations (represented by the difference between total trust assets and total trust liabilities) generated cash flows of $12.7 million as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, our residual interest in securitizations (represented by the difference between total trust assets and total trust liabilities) increased to $17.3 million compared to $15.7 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in residual fair value in 2017 was the result of an increase in projected cash flows due to an improvement in the loans within certain trusts. For additional information regarding the long - term mortgage portfolio refer to Financial Condition and Results of Operations below. Corporate The corporate segment includes all corporate services groups, public company costs as well as debt expense related to the Convertible Notes and capital leases. This corporate services group supports all operating segments. A portion of the corporate services costs are allocated to the operating segments. The costs associated with being a public company, unused space for growth as well as the interest expense related to the Convertible Notes and capital leases is not allocated to our operating segments and remains in this segment. For additional information regarding the corporate segment refer to Results of Operations by Business Segment below. Critical Accounting Policies We define critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. Our critical accounting policies require management to make difficult and complex judgments that rely on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to the effect of changing market conditions and/or consumer behavior. In determining which accounting policies meet this definition, we considered our policies with respect to the valuation of our assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations. We believe the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and that are particularly susceptible to significant change to our financial condition and results of operations include the following:  			 		 			 			fair value of financial instruments;  			 		 			 			variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets and liabilities;  			 		 			 			goodwill and intangible assets;  			 		 			 			net realizable value of REO; 34 Table of Contents  			 		 			 			repurchase reserve;  			 		 			 			interest income and interest expense;  			 		 			 			income taxes; and  			 		 			 			business combinations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial Accounting Standards Board - Accounting Standards Codification FASB ASC 820 - 10 - 35 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and outlines a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price). Fair value measurements are categorized into a three - level hierarchy based on the extent to which the measurement relies on observable market inputs in measuring fair value. Level 1, which is the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 is based on observable market - based inputs, other than quoted prices, in active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3, which is the lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy, is based on unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified within this hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The use of fair value to measure our financial instruments is fundamental to our financial statements and is a critical accounting estimate because a substantial portion of our assets and liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value. Financial instruments classified as Level 3 are generally based on unobservable inputs, and the process to determine fair value is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. These assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions and interest rates, could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Mortgage loans held - for - sale - We elected to carry our mortgage loans held - for - sale originated or acquired from the mortgage lending operation at fair value. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants. Mortgage servicing rights - We elected to carry all of our mortgage servicing rights arising from our mortgage lending operation at fair value. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is based upon a discounted cash flow model. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating the fair value of servicing. These assumptions include estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, prepayment and late fees, among other considerations. Derivative financial instruments - We utilize certain derivative instruments in the ordinary course of our business to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. These derivative instruments include forward sales of MBS and forward loan sale commitments (Hedging Instruments). We also issue IRLCs to borrowers in connection with single family mortgage loan originations. We recognize all derivative instruments at fair value. The estimated fair value of IRLCs are based on underlying loan types with similar characteristics using the TBA MBS market, which is actively quoted and easily validated through external sources. The data inputs used in this valuation include, but are not limited to, loan type, underlying loan amount, note rate, loan program, and expected sale date of the loan, adjusted for current market conditions. These valuations are adjusted at the loan level to consider the servicing release premium and loan pricing adjustments specific to each loan. For all IRLCs, the base value is then adjusted for the anticipated Pull - through Rate. The fair value of the Hedging Instruments is based on the actively quoted TBA MBS market using observable inputs related to characteristics of the underlying MBS stratified by product, coupon and settlement date and are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The initial and subsequent changes in value of IRLCs and forward sale commitments are a component of gain on sale of loans, net in the consolidated statements of operations. 35 Table of Contents Long - term debt - Long - term debt (consisting of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes) is reported at fair value within the long - term mortgage portfolio. These securities are measured based upon an analysis prepared by management, which utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis which takes into consideration our credit risk. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as change in fair value of long - term debt. Our estimate of the fair value of the long - term debt requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the timing and amount of the future obligation. Changes in assumptions resulting from changes in our credit risk profile will affect the estimated fair value of the long - term debt and those changes are recorded as a component of net earnings. A change in assumptions associated with the improvement in our credit risk profile could result in a significant increase in the estimated fair value of the long - term debt which would result in a significant charge to net earnings. Variable Interest Entities and Transfers of Financial Assets and Liabilities Historically, we securitized mortgages in the form of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), which were consolidated and accounted for as secured borrowings for financial statement purposes. We also securitized mortgages in the form of real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs), which were either consolidated or unconsolidated depending on the design of the securitization structure. CMO and certain REMIC securitizations contained structural terms that resulted in the transferee (securitization trust) to not be a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE), therefore we consolidated the variable interest entity (VIE) as it was the primary beneficiary of the sole residual interest in each securitization trust. Generally, this was achieved by including terms in the securitization agreements that gave us the ability to unilaterally cause the securitization trust to return specific mortgages, other than through a clean - up call. Amounts consolidated are included in trust assets and liabilities as securitized mortgage collateral, real estate owned, derivative assets, securitized mortgage borrowings and derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our estimate of the fair value of our net retained residual interests in unconsolidated securitizations, which are included in investment securities available - for - sale in the consolidated balance sheets, requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the timing and amount of future cash flows from the residual interests. We are exposed to credit risk from the underlying mortgage loans in unconsolidated securitizations to the extent we retain subordinated interests. Changes in expected cash flows resulting from changes in expected net credit losses will impact the value of our subordinated retained interests and those changes are recorded as a component of change in fair value of net trust assets. In contrast, for securitizations that are structured as secured borrowing, we recognize interest income over the life of the securitized mortgage collateral and interest expense incurred for the securitized mortgage borrowings. We refer to these transactions as consolidated securitizations. The mortgage loans collateralizing the debt securities for these financings are included in securitized mortgage collateral and the debt securities payable to investors in these securitizations are included in securitized mortgage borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet. Whether a securitization is consolidated or unconsolidated, investors in the securities issued by the securitization trust have no recourse to our non - securitized assets or to us and have no ability to require us to provide additional assets, but rather have recourse only to the assets transferred to the trust. Whereas the accounting differences are significant, the underlying economic impact to us, over time, will be the same regardless of whether the securitization trust is consolidated or unconsolidated. These securitizations are evaluated for consolidation based on the provisions of FASB ASC 810 - 10 - 25, which eliminated the concept of a QSPE and changed the approach to determine a securitization trust's primary beneficiary. Amounts consolidated are included in trust assets and liabilities as securitized mortgage collateral, real estate owned, derivative assets, securitized mortgage borrowings and derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, under which the total consideration transferred (including contingent consideration) is allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired 36 Table of Contents (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed results in goodwill. We perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In performing the qualitative assessment, we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units. These factors include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. We also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed. If, after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment, no further testing is performed; however, if we conclude otherwise, the first step of the two-step impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value, the amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Impairment is permanently recognized by writing down the asset to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated lives using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset are consumed. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, in which case any impairment charge would be recorded to earnings. Acquisition of CashCall Mortgage On January 6, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with CashCall, Inc. (CashCall), an unrelated entity, pursuant to which the we agreed to purchase certain assets of CashCall's residential mortgage operations. The CashCall Mortgage (CCM) acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to FASB ASC 805.  The assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  We made significant estimates and exercised significant judgment in estimating fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities.  We retained the services of a third party to assist in the valuation of the intangible assets.  The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in tax deductible goodwill of $104.6 million. We perform an assessment each year, or whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred,  to determine if the estimated the fair value of CCM exceeds its carrying value, which would be an indication that goodwill impairment may exist.  In previous years, the estimated fair value of CCM substantially exceeded its carrying value.  As of December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of CCM did not substantially exceed its carrying value.  The significant assumptions in the assessment include expected future origination levels and expected future gain on sale margins.  CCM is a consumer direct call center that provides residential mortgages.  Given that the mortgage industry often fluctuates with the fluctuation of prevailing interest rates, the market that CCM operates in is inherent with uncertainty.  In addition, the ongoing dynamic mortgage compliance landscape contributes to the uncertainty of the mortgage market.  Each of these factors can have effect on expected mortgage origination volumes as well as the gain on sale margins which generally tend to follow origination volumes, more originations means higher margins, lower originations mean lower margins.  Given the macroeconomic forces that exist today, it is difficult to predict volumes and margins into the future.  If our assumptions are not correct, it is possible that an assessment of the estimated fair value of CCM will not exceed its carrying value in the future, in which case impairment of goodwill will be recorded. Net Realizable Value (NRV) of REO We consider the NRV of REO properties in evaluating REO losses. When real estate is acquired in settlement of mortgage loans, or other real estate owned, the mortgage is written - down to a percentage of the property's appraised value, broker's price opinion or list price less estimated selling costs and including mortgage insurance proceeds expected to be received. Subsequent changes in the NRV of the REO is reflected as a write - down of REO and results in additional losses. 37 Table of Contents Repurchase Reserve When we sell loans through whole loan sales we are required to make normal and customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser. Our whole loan sale agreements generally require us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser. In addition, we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale. Investors may request us to repurchase loans or to indemnify them against losses on certain loans which the investors believe either do not comply with applicable representations or warranties or defaulted shortly after its purchase. Upon completion of its own investigation regarding the investor claims, we repurchase or provide indemnification on certain loans, as appropriate. We maintain a liability reserve for expected losses on dispositions of loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of this repurchase liability reserve based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests, actual loss experience, settlement negotiations, and other relevant factors including economic conditions. We record a provision for losses relating to such representations and warranties as part of each loan sale transactions. The method used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, estimated future defaults and loan repurchase rates and the potential severity of loss in the event of defaults and the probability of reimbursement by the correspondent loan seller. We establish a liability at the time loans are sold and continually update our estimated repurchase liability. The level of the repurchase liability for representations and warranties is difficult to estimate and requires considerable management judgment. The level of mortgage loan repurchase losses is dependent on economic factors, investor demand strategies, and other external conditions that may change over the lives of the underlying loans. Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income on securitized mortgage collateral and interest expense on securitized mortgage borrowings are recorded using the effective interest method for the period based on the previous quarter - end's estimated fair value. Interest expense on long - term debt is recorded using the effective interest method based on estimated future interest rates and cash flows. Income Taxes Provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized and reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in the valuation allowance. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. We provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the adequacy of the valuation allowance, we consider all forms of evidence, including: (1) historic earnings or losses; (2) the ability to realize deferred tax assets through carry back to prior periods; (3) anticipated taxable income resulting from the reversal of taxable temporary differences; (4) tax planning strategies; and (5) anticipated future earnings exclusive of the reversal of taxable temporary differences. Business Combinations Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, ""Business Combinations."" Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes 100 percent of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, regardless of the percentage owned, at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price 38 Table of Contents over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including other identifiable assets, exceeds the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed which involve contingencies must also be recognized at their estimated fair value, provided such fair value can be determined during the measurement period. Acquisition - related costs, including severance, conversion and other restructuring charges, such as abandoned space accruals, are expensed at the time of the acquisition. Results of operations of an acquired business are included in the statement of operations from the date of acquisition.

Significant cash outflows affecting the decrease in cash were the $56.0 million investment in MSRs, repayment of the $30.0 million term financing, $19.3 million earn-out payments to CashCall Inc., $5.6 million purchase of mortgage servicing rights, a $4.4 million increase in warehouse haircuts (difference between loan balance funded and amount advanced by warehouse lender) associated with the increase in mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and the payment of operating expenses. Partially offsetting the decrease in cash was $55.5 million in proceeds from common stock offering, $35.1 million in net borrowings under the MSR financing facility and $12.7 million in residual cash flows. Mortgage loans held - for - sale increased $180.4 million to $568.8 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $388.4 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was due to $7.1 billion in originations offset by $6.9 billion in loan sales. As a normal course of our origination and sales cycle, loans held - for - sale at the end of any period are generally sold within one or two subsequent months. 39 Table of Contents Finance receivables decreased $21.1 million to $41.8 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $62.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to $909.7 million in fundings offset by $930.8 million in settlements. Mortgage servicing rights increased $22.9 million to $154.4 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $131.5 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was due to servicing retained loan sales of $6.1 billion as well as a purchase of approximately $570.0 million in UPB of MSRs. Partially offsetting the increase was a bulk sale of NonQM MSRs totaling $155.9 million in UPB and a mark - to - market reduction in fair value of $37.9 million, which includes the change in fair value associated with principal reductions as well as prepayments. At December 31, 2017, we serviced $16.3 billion in UPB for others as compared to $12.4 billion at December 31, 2016. Loans eligible for repurchase from Ginnie Mae increased $37.8 million to $47.7 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $9.9 million at December 31, 2016.  The increase was due to an increase in loans 90 or more days past due and represents loans that we do not own, but have the unilateral right to repurchase from Ginnie Mae as part of our contractual arrangements as the servicer of the loans.  This right requires us to record the loans as well as a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets. As part of our repurchase reserve, we record a repurchase provision to provide for estimated losses from the sale of all mortgage loans, including these loans.  Our Ginnie Mae servicing portfolio increased to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. Other assets decreased $27.6 million to $33.2 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $60.8 million at December 31, 2016.  The decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in our deferred tax asset as a result of the reduction in projected future utilization, changes in tax rates due to the Tax Act, re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and an increase in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the amortization of goodwill. Warehouse borrowings increased $154.8 million to $575.4 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $420.6 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was due to an increase in mortgage loans held - for - sale at December 31, 2017. During 2017, we increased our total borrowing capacity to $960.0 million as compared to $925.0 million at December 31, 2016. In August and February 2017, we entered into separate agreements with two lenders providing for MSR financing facilities of up to $30.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively.  The $30.0 million facility allows us to borrow up to 55% of the fair market value of Freddie Mac pledged mortgage servicing rights. The $40.0 million facility allows us to borrow up to 55% of the fair market value of Fannie Mae pledged mortgage servicing rights.  At December 31, 2017, the balance outstanding on the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae facilities was $10.0 million and $25.1 million, respectively. As part of the CCM acquisition in the first quarter of 2015, we recorded $124.6 million of contingent consideration associated with the three year earn - out provision for CCM. During 2017, we recorded $13.3 million change in fair value associated with a decrease in the contingent consideration liability resulting in an increase to earnings. In addition, we made $19.3 million in earn out payments to CashCall Inc. reducing the liability. Partially offsetting the reduction was $2.1 million in accretion of the contingent consideration. As of December 31, 2017, the contingent consideration was $0.6 million. Long - term debt decreased $2.2 million to $45.0 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to $47.2 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the exchange agreement entered into in May 2017, whereby we issued 412,264 shares of common stock in exchange for trust preferred securities with a fair value of $5.6 million. Partially offsetting the decrease in long-term debt was a mark-to-market increase in fair value of $2.9 million. As part of the Fannie Mae financing facility entered into in February 2017, the proceeds were used to pay off the remaining $29.9 million balance of the Term Financing, which was entered into in 2015. Book value per share decreased 12% to $12.66 at December 31, 2017 as compared to $14.42 at December 31, 2016. Book value per common share decreased 9% to $10.19 as of December 31, 2017, as 40 Table of Contents compared to $11.19 as of December 31, 2016 (inclusive of the remaining $51.8 million of liquidation preference on our preferred stock). The changes in total assets and liabilities are primarily attributable to decreases in our trust assets and trust liabilities as summarized below.

For unconsolidated securitizations the residual interests represent the fair value of investment securities available - for - sale. For consolidated securitizations, the residual interests are represented by the fair value of securitized mortgage collateral and real estate owned, offset by the fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings and net derivative liabilities. We receive cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations to the extent they are available after required distributions to bondholders and maintaining specified overcollateralization levels and other specified parameters (such as maximum delinquency and cumulative default) within the trusts. The estimated fair value of the residual interests, represented by the difference in the fair value of total trust assets and total trust liabilities, was $17.3 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $15.7 million at December 31, 2016. We update our collateral assumptions quarterly based on recent delinquency, default, prepayment and loss experience. Additionally, we update the forward interest rates and investor yield (discount rate) assumptions based on information derived from market participants. During the year ended December 31, 2017, actual losses were relatively flat and were in line with forecasted losses for the majority of trusts with residual value.  Principal payments and liquidations of securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings also contributed to the reduction in trust assets and liabilities. The increase in residual fair value was the result of a decrease in loss assumptions as well as recoveries on certain multi-family trusts with residual value.  			 		 			 			The estimated fair value of securitized mortgage collateral decreased $359.9 million during 2017, primarily due to reductions in principal from borrower payments and transfers of loans to REO for single - family and multi - family collateral. Additionally, other trust assets decreased $2.9 million during 2017,  primarily due to REO liquidations of $29.1 million.  Partially offsetting the decrease was an increase of $18.8 million in REO from foreclosures and a $7.4 million increase in the NRV of REO.  			 		 			 			The estimated fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings decreased $364.3 million during 2017,  primarily due to reductions in principal balances from principal payments during the period for single-family and multi-family collateral as well as a decrease in loss assumptions. Prior to 2008, we securitized mortgage loans by transferring originated and acquired residential single - family mortgage loans and multi - family commercial loans (the ""transferred assets"") into non - recourse bankruptcy remote trusts which in turn issued tranches of bonds to investors supported only by the cash flows of the transferred assets. Because the assets and liabilities in the securitizations are nonrecourse to us, the bondholders cannot look to us for repayment of their bonds in the event of a shortfall. These securitizations were structured to include interest rate derivatives. We retained the residual interest in each trust, and in most cases would perform the master servicing function. A trustee and sub - servicer, unrelated to us, was utilized for each securitization. Cash flows from the loans (the loan payments as well as liquidation of foreclosed real estate properties) collected by the loan sub - servicer are remitted to us, the master servicer. The master servicer remits payments to the trustee who remits payments to the bondholders (investors). The sub - servicer collects loan 41 Table of Contents payments and performs loss mitigation activities for defaulted loans. These activities include foreclosing on properties securing defaulted loans, which results in REO. Our real estate services segment also performs mitigation activities for loans within the portfolio. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), we are required to consolidate all but one of these trusts (as we are not the master servicer on this one trust) on our statement of financial condition and results of operations. For the one trust we did not consolidate, the residual interest is reported as investment securities available - for - sale. For the trusts we do consolidate, the loans are included in the statement of financial condition as ""securitized mortgage collateral"", the foreclosed loans are included in the statement of financial condition as ""real estate owned"" and the various bond tranches owned by investors are included in the statement of financial condition as ""securitized mortgage borrowings."" Any interest rate derivatives remaining in the trusts are included in our statement of financial condition as ""derivative assets"" or ""derivative liabilities,"" respectively. To the extent there is excess overcollateralization (as defined in the securitization agreements) in these securitization trusts, we receive cash flows from the excess interest collected monthly from the residual interest we own. Because (i) we elected the fair value option on the securitized mortgage collateral, securitized mortgage borrowings, (ii) derivative assets/liabilities are carried at fair value, and (iii) real estate owned is reflected at NRV, which closely approximates fair market value, the net of the trust assets and trust liabilities represents the estimated fair value of the residual interests we own. To estimate fair value of the assets and liabilities within the securitization trusts each reporting period, management uses an industry standard valuation and analytical model that is updated monthly with current collateral, real estate, derivative, bond and cost (servicer, trustee, etc.) information for each securitization trust. We employ an internal process to validate the accuracy of the model as well as the data within this model. Forecasted assumptions sometimes referred to as ""curves,"" for defaults, loss severity, interest rates (LIBOR) and prepayments are inputted into the valuation model for each securitization trust. We hire third - party market participants to provide forecasted curves for the aforementioned assumptions for each of the securitizations. Before inputting this information into the model, management employs a process to qualitatively and quantitatively review the assumption curves for reasonableness using other information gathered from the mortgage and real estate market (i.e., third party home price indices, published industry reports discussing regional mortgage and commercial loan performance and delinquency) as well as actual default and foreclosure information for each trust from the respective trustees. We use the valuation model to generate the expected cash flows to be collected from the trust assets and the expected required bondholder distribution (trust liabilities). To the extent that the trusts are over collateralized, we may receive the excess interest as the holder of the residual interest. The information above provides us with the future expected cash flows for the securitized mortgage collateral, real estate owned, securitized mortgage borrowings, derivative assets/liabilities, and the residual interests. To determine the discount rates to apply to these cash flows, we gather information from the bond pricing services and other market participants regarding estimated investor required yields for each bond tranche. Based on that information and the collateral type and vintage, we determine an acceptable range of expected yields an investor would require including an appropriate risk premium for each bond tranche. We use the blended yield of the bond tranches together with the residual interests to determine an appropriate yield for the securitized mortgage collateral in each securitization (after taking into consideration any derivatives in the securitization). 42 Table of Contents The following table presents changes in the trust assets and trust liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2017: TRUST LIABILITIES 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Level 3 Recurring Fair 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Value Measurement 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Level 3 Recurring Fair 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						NRV (1) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Value Measurement 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Securitized 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Real 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Securitized 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Net 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						mortgage 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						estate 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Total trust 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						mortgage 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						trust  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						collateral 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						owned 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						assets 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						borrowings 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						assets 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Recorded book value at December 31, 2016 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 4,021,891 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 11,399 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 4,033,290 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (4,017,603) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 15,687 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Total gains/(losses) included in earnings: 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Interest income 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 46,077 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -

Inclusive of losses from REO, total trust assets above reflect a net gain of $252.8 million as a result of an increase in fair value from securitized mortgage collateral and other trust assets of $245.4 million and gains from REO of $7.4 million. Net losses on trust liabilities were $246.6 million from the increase in fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings. As a result, non-interest income - net trust assets totaled an increase of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in projected future cash flows due to a decrease in loss assumptions in a 2004 single-family and 2006 multi-family vintage trusts. Since the consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to us, our economic risk is limited to our residual interests in these securitization trusts. Therefore, in the following table we have netted trust assets and trust liabilities to present these residual interests more simply. Our residual interests in securitizations are segregated between our single - family (SF) residential and multi - family (MF) residential portfolios and are represented by the difference between trust assets and trust liabilities. 43 Table of Contents The following tables present the estimated fair value of our residual interests by securitization vintage year and other related assumptions used to derive these values at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016: Estimated Fair Value of Residual 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Estimated Fair Value of Residual 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Interests by Vintage Year at 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Interests by Vintage Year at 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						December 31, 2017 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						December 31, 2016 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Origination Year 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						SF 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						MF 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Total 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						SF 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						MF 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Total 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						2002-2003 (1) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 8,311 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 663 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 8,974 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 8,402 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 921 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 9,323 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						2004 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 2,041 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 970 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 3,011 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 1,267 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 653 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 1,920 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						2005 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 54 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 85 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 139 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -

2003 vintage year includes CMO 2007 - A, since the majority of the mortgages collateralized in this securitization were originated during this period. (2) 			 		 			 			The estimated fair values of residual interests in vintage years 2005 through 2007 is reflective of higher estimated future losses and investor yield requirements compared to earlier vintage years. We utilize a number of assumptions to value securitized mortgage collateral, securitized mortgage borrowings and residual interests. These assumptions include estimated collateral default rates and loss severities (credit losses), collateral prepayment rates, forward interest rates and investor yields (discount rates). We use the same collateral assumptions for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings as the collateral assumptions determine collateral cash flows which are used to pay interest and principal for securitized mortgage borrowings and excess spread, if any, to the residual interests. However, we use different investor yield (discount rate) assumptions for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings and the discount rate used for residual interests based on underlying collateral characteristics, vintage year, assumed risk and market participant assumptions.

Despite the increase in housing prices through December 31, 2017, housing prices in many parts of the country are still at levels which has significantly reduced or eliminated equity for loans originated after 2003. Future loss estimates are significantly higher for mortgage loans included in securitization vintages after 2004 which reflect severe home price deterioration and defaults experienced with mortgages originated during these periods. Operational and Market Risks We are exposed to a variety of market risks which include interest rate risk, credit risk, real estate risk, prepayment risk and liquidity risk. 44 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Interest Rate Risk - Mortgage Lending.  We are exposed to interest rate risks relating to our ongoing mortgage lending operations. We use derivative instruments to manage some of our interest rate risk. However, we do not attempt to hedge interest rate risk completely. For a further description on interest rate risk related to mortgage lending, see Item. 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk - Securitized Trusts, Term Financing and Long - term Debt.  Our earnings from the long - term mortgage portfolio depend largely on our interest rate spread, represented by the relationship between the yield on our interest - earning assets (primarily investment securities available - for -  sale and securitized mortgage collateral) and the cost of our interest - bearing liabilities (primarily securitized mortgage borrowings and long - term debt). Our interest rate spread is impacted by several factors, including general economic factors, forward interest rates and the credit quality of mortgage loans in the long - term mortgage portfolio. The residual interests in our long - term mortgage portfolio are sensitive to changes in interest rates on securitized mortgage collateral and the related securitized mortgage borrowings. Changes in interest rates can affect the cash flows and fair values of our trust assets and liabilities, as well as our earnings and stockholders' equity. Derivative instruments were used to manage some of the interest rate risk in our long - term mortgage portfolio. However, we did not attempt to hedge interest rate risk completely. To help mitigate some of the exposure to the effect of changing interest rates on cash flows on securitized mortgage borrowings, we utilized derivative instruments primarily in the form of interest rate swap agreements (swaps) and, to a lesser extent, interest rate cap agreements (caps) and interest rate floor agreements (floors). These derivative instruments were recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. For non - exchange traded contracts, fair value was based on the amounts that would be required to settle the positions with the related counterparties as of the valuation date. Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities were based on observable market inputs, if available. To the extent observable market inputs were not available, fair value measurements include our judgment about future cash flows, forward interest rates and certain other factors, including counterparty risk. Additionally, these values also took into account our own credit standing, to the extent applicable; thus, the valuation of the derivative instrument included the estimated value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the derivative instruments used to help mitigate interest rate risk associated with the long-term mortgage portfolio expired. We are also subject to interest rate risk on our term financing and long - term debt (consisting of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes). These interest bearing liabilities include adjustable rate periods based on one - month LIBOR (term financing) and three - month LIBOR (trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes). We do not currently hedge our exposure to the effect of changing interest rates related to these interest - bearing liabilities. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Credit Risk We provide representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of the loans sold that typically are in place for the life of the loan. In the event of a breach of these representations and warranties, we may be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or indemnify the purchaser, and any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan may be borne by us unless we have recourse to our correspondent seller. We maintain a reserve for losses on loans repurchased or indemnified as a result of breaches of representations and warranties on our sold loans. Our estimate is based on our most recent data regarding loan repurchases and indemnity payments, actual losses on repurchased loans, and recovery history, among other factors. Our assumptions are affected by factors both internal and external in nature. Internal factors include, among other things, level of loan sales, the expectation of credit loss on repurchases and indemnifications, our success rate at appealing repurchase demands and our ability to recover any losses from third parties. External factors that may affect our estimate includes, among other things, the overall economic condition in the housing market, the economic condition of borrowers, the political environment at investor 45 Table of Contents agencies and the overall U.S. and world economy. Many of the factors are beyond our control and may lead to judgments that are susceptible to change. Counterparty Credit Risk.  We are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non - performance by counterparties to various agreements. We monitor our counterparties and currently do not anticipate losses due to counterparty non - performance. Credit Risk - Securitized Trusts.  We manage credit risk by actively managing delinquencies and defaults through our servicers. Starting with the second half of 2007 we have not retained any additional mortgages in our long - term mortgage portfolio. Our securitized mortgage collateral primarily consists of non - conforming mortgages which when originated were generally within typical Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines but had loan characteristics, which may have included higher loan balances, higher loan -  to - value ratios or lower documentation requirements (including stated - income loans), that made them non - conforming under those guidelines. Using historical losses, current portfolio statistics and market conditions and available market data, we have estimated future loan losses on the long -  term mortgage portfolio, which are included in the fair value adjustment to our securitized mortgage collateral. The credit performance for the loans has been clearly far worse than our initial expectations when the loans were originated. We have seen some restoration of real estate values, however the ultimate level of realized losses will largely be influenced by local real estate conditions in areas where underlying properties are located, including the recovery of the housing market and overall strength of the economy. If market conditions continue to deteriorate in excess of our expectations, we may need to recognize additional fair value reductions to our securitized mortgage collateral, which may also affect the value of the related securitized mortgage borrowings and residual interests. We monitor our servicers to attempt to ensure that they perform loss mitigation, foreclosure and collection functions according to their servicing practices and each securitization trust's pooling and servicing agreement. We have met with the management of our servicers to assess our borrowers' current ability to pay their mortgages and to make arrangements with selected delinquent borrowers which will result in the best interest of the trust and borrower, in an effort to minimize the number of mortgages which become seriously delinquent. When resolving delinquent mortgages, servicers are required to take timely action. The servicer is required to determine payment collection under various circumstances, which will result in the maximum financial benefit. This is accomplished by either working with the borrower to bring the mortgage current by modifying the loan with terms that will maximize the recovery or by foreclosing and liquidating the property. At a foreclosure sale, the trusts consolidated on our balance sheet generally acquire title to the property. Real Estate Risk Residential property values are subject to volatility and may be negatively affected by numerous factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions such as unemployment and interest rate environment; local real estate conditions including housing inventory and foreclosures; and demographic factors. Decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral securing and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans, which could cause us to suffer losses. Prepayment Risk We historically used prepayment penalties as a method of partially mitigating prepayment risk for those borrowers that have the ability to refinance. The economic downturn, lack of available credit and declines in property values in certain parts of the country have limited some borrowers' ability to refinance. These factors have reduced prepayment risk within our long - term mortgage portfolio. With the seasoning of the long - term mortgage portfolio, a significant portion of prepayment penalties terms have expired, thereby further reducing prepayment penalty income. Prepayment speed is a measurement of how quickly UPB is reduced. Items reducing UPB include normal monthly loan principal payments, loan refinancings, voluntary property sales and involuntary property sales such as foreclosures or short sales. Prepayment speed impacts future servicing fees, fair value of mortgage servicing rights and float income. When prepayment speed increases, our servicing fees decrease 46 Table of Contents faster than projected due to the shortened life of a portfolio. Faster prepayment speeds will cause our mortgage servicing rights fair value to decrease. Liquidity Risk We are exposed to liquidity risks relating to our ongoing mortgage lending operations. We primarily fund our mortgage lending originations through warehouse facilities with third - party lenders. We primarily use facilities with national and regional banks. The warehouse facilities are secured by and used to fund single - family residential mortgage loans. In addition, the warehouse lenders require cash to be posted as additional collateral to secure the borrowings. In order to mitigate the liquidity risk associated with warehouse borrowings, we attempt to sell our mortgage loans within 10 - 15 days from acquisition or origination.  We have recently entered into revolving lines of credit to finance our MSR portfolio.  The MSR financings are secured by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae servicing rights.  We are able to borrow up to 55% of the fair market value of the servicing rights. Long - Term Mortgage Portfolio Credit Quality We use the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) method to define delinquency as a contractually required payment being 30 or more days past due. We measure delinquencies from the date of the last payment due date in which a payment was received. Delinquencies for loans 60 days late or greater, foreclosures and delinquent bankruptcies were $821.8 million or 19.1% of the long - term mortgage portfolio as of December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.0 billion or 20.0% as of December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes the unpaid principal balances of loans in our mortgage portfolio, included within securitized mortgage collateral, that were 60 or more days delinquent (utilizing the MBA method) as of the periods indicated: December 31,  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Total 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						December 31,  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Total 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Securitized mortgage collateral 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2017 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Collateral 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2016 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Collateral 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						60 - 89 days delinquent 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 112,188 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 2.6 				 				 					 						%   				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 140,567 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 2.8 				 				 					 						% 				 			 					 						90 or more days delinquent 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 336,525 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 7.8 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 417,947 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 8.2 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Foreclosures (1) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 174,871 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 4.1 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 224,633 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 4.4 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Delinquent bankruptcies (2) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 198,212 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 4.6 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 232,249 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 4.6 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Total 60 or more days delinquent 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 821,796 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 19.1 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 1,015,396 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 20.0 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Total collateral 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 4,301,316 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 100.0 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 5,078,500 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 100.0 (1) 			 		 			 			Represents properties in the process of foreclosure.

It is our policy to place a mortgage on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days delinquent and to reverse from revenue any accrued interest, except for interest income on securitized mortgage collateral when the scheduled payment is received from the servicer. The servicers are required to advance principal and interest on loans within the securitization trusts to the extent the advances are considered recoverable. IFC, a subsidiary of IMH and master servicer, may be required to advance funds, or in most cases cause the loan servicers to advance funds, to cover 47 Table of Contents principal and interest payments not received from borrowers depending on the status of their mortgages. As of December 31, 2017, non - performing assets (unpaid principal balance of loans 90 or more days delinquent, foreclosures and delinquent bankruptcies plus REO) as a percentage of the total collateral was 16.7%. At December 31, 2016, non - performing assets to total collateral was 17.4%. Non - performing assets decreased by approximately $168.1 million at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of non - performing assets (representing the fair value of loans 90 or more days delinquent, foreclosures and delinquent bankruptcies plus REO) was $212.7 million or 4.5% of total assets. At December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of non - performing assets was $263.6 million or 5.4% of total assets. REO, which consists of residential real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans, is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value less estimated selling costs. Adjustments to the loan carrying value required at the time of foreclosure are included in the change in the fair value of net trust assets. Changes in our estimates of net realizable value subsequent to the time of foreclosure and through the time of ultimate disposition are recorded as gains or losses from real estate owned in the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $7.4 million increase in net realizable value of the REO compared to a decrease of $5.9 million for the comparable 2016 period. Increases and write-downs of the net realizable value reflect increases or declines in value of the REO subsequent to foreclosure date, but prior to the date of sale. The following table presents the balances of the REO for continuing operations: December 31,  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2017 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						2016 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						REO 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 15,519 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 25,802 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Impairment (1) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (6,977) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (14,403) 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Ending balance 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 8,542 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 11,399 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						REO inside trusts 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 8,542 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 11,399 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						REO outside trusts 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Total 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 8,542 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 11,399 (1) 			 		 			 			Impairment represents the cumulative write - downs of net realizable value subsequent to foreclosure. In calculating the cash flows to assess the fair value of the securitized mortgage collateral, we estimate the future losses embedded in our loan portfolio. In evaluating the adequacy of these losses, management takes many factors into consideration. For instance, a detailed analysis of historical loan performance data is accumulated and reviewed. This data is analyzed for loss performance and prepayment performance by product type, origination year and securitization issuance. The data is also broken down by collection status. Our estimate of losses for these loans is developed by estimating both the rate of default of the loans and the amount of loss severity in the event of default. The rate of default is assigned to the loans based on their attributes (e.g., original loan - to - value, borrower credit score, documentation type, geographic location, etc.) and collection status. The rate of default is based on analysis of migration of loans from each aging category. The loss severity is determined by estimating the net proceeds from the ultimate sale of the foreclosed property. The results of that analysis are then applied to the current mortgage portfolio and an estimate is created. We believe that pooling of mortgages with similar characteristics is an appropriate methodology in which to evaluate the future loan losses. Management recognizes that there are qualitative factors that must be taken into consideration when evaluating and measuring losses in the loan portfolios. These items include, but are not limited to, economic indicators that may affect the borrower's ability to pay, changes in value of collateral, political factors, employment and market conditions, competitor's performance, market perception, historical losses, and industry statistics. The assessment for losses is based on delinquency trends and prior loss experience and management's judgment and assumptions regarding various matters, including general economic conditions and loan portfolio composition. Management continually evaluates these assumptions and various relevant factors affecting credit quality and inherent losses. 48 Table of Contents Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and 2015 For the Year Ended December 31,  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2017 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2016 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2015 				 			 					 						Revenues 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 138,705 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 297,756 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 166,957 				 			 					 						Expenses (1) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (156,430) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (238,043) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (95,681) 				 			 					 						Net interest income 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 4,343 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 2,790 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 1,946 				 			 					 						Loss on extinguishment of debt 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (1,265) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 			 					 						Change in fair value of long-term debt 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (2,949) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (14,436) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (8,661) 				 			 					 						Change in fair value of net trust assets, including trust REO gains (losses) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 6,213 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (304) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (5,638) 				 			 					 						Income tax (expense) benefit 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (20,138) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (1,093) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 21,876 				 			 					 						Net (loss) earnings 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (31,521) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 46,670 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 80,799 				 			 					 						(Loss) earnings per share available to common stockholders - basic 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (1.62) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 3.54 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 8.00 				 			 					 						(Loss) earnings per share available to common stockholders - diluted 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (1.62) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 3.31 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 6.40 (1) 			 		 			 			Includes changes in contingent consideration liability resulting in income of $13.3 million, expense of $30.1 million and income of $45.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, gain on sale of loans, net totaled $136.1 million compared to $311.0 million in the comparable 2016 period. The $174.9  million decrease is primarily due to a $134.2 million decrease in premiums from the sale of mortgage loans, a $72.2 million decrease in premiums from servicing retained loan sales, a $19.5  million increase in realized and unrealized net losses on derivative instruments and a $1.2 million increase in provision for repurchases.  Partially offsetting the reduction was a $43.9 million decrease in direct origination expenses and an $8.4 million increase in mark-to-market gains on LHFS. The overall decrease in gain on sale of loans, net was primarily due to a 45% decrease in volumes as well as a decrease in gain on sale margins.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, we originated and sold $7.1 billion and $6.9 billion of loans, respectively, as compared to $12.9 billion and $12.8 billion of loans originated and sold, respectively, during the same period in 2016.  Margins decreased to approximately 191 bps for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 241 bps for the same period in 2016 due to margin compression across all three channels as a result of the increase in interest rates as compared to 2016 as well as an increase in competition for volume. Real estate services fees, net.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, real estate services fees, net were $5.9 million compared to $8.4 million in the comparable 2016 period. The $2.5 million decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in transactions related to the decline in the number of loans and the UPB of the long-term mortgage portfolio as compared to 2016. Servicing income, net.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, servicing fees, net was $31.9 million 49 Table of Contents compared to $13.7 million in the comparable 2016 period.  The increase in servicing fees, net was the result of the servicing portfolio increasing 91% to an average balance of $14.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an average balance of $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.   The increase in the average balance of the servicing portfolio is a result of servicing retained loan sales of $6.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017 partially offset by a bulk sale of MSRs of approximately $155.9 million. Loss on mortgage servicing rights, net.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, loss on MSRs was $35.9 million compared to $36.4 million in the comparable 2016 period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $37.9 million loss from a change in fair value of MSRs primarily the result of mark-to-market changes related to amortization as well as an increase in prepayments and prepayment speed assumptions.  For the year ended December 31, 2017,  we had a $93 thousand loss on sale of mortgage servicing rights related to refunds of premiums to investors for loan payoffs partially offset by recoveries of previously written off holdbacks associated with sales of servicing rights in previous periods.   Partially offsetting the loss was a $2.1 million increase in realized and unrealized gains from hedging instruments related to MSRs.

Gain on sale of loans, net includes the operating expenses of CCM in the first quarter of 2015 before we closed the transaction on March 31, 2015.  We received the economic benefit of the CCM transactions from the beginning of 2015 but did not hire the employees of CCM or incur direct operating expenditures of CCM until after the close of the transaction.  Accordingly, operating expenses for CCM in the first quarter of 2015 were included within gain on sale of loans, net as loan origination costs in the consolidated statements of operations.  Beginning with the second quarter of 2015 the operating expenses of CCM were included in personnel, business promotion, general, administrative and other expense, as normally presented. For the year ended December 31, 2016, gain on sale of loans, net totaled $311.0 million compared to $169.2 million in the comparable 2015 period. The $141.8 million increase is primarily due to increased volumes and gain on sale margins.   For the year ended December 31, 2016, we originated and sold $12.9 billion and $12.8 billion of loans, respectively, as compared to $9.3 billion and $9.2 billion of loans originated and sold, respectively, during the same period in 2015.  Margins increased to approximately 241 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 183 bps for the same period in 2015 due to a higher concentration of retail loans which have higher margins as well as the aforementioned expenses of CCM being included in gain on sale of loans, net in the first quarter of 2015. Real estate services fees, net.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, real estate services fees, net were $8.4 million compared to $9.9 million in the comparable 2015 period. The $1.5 million decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in transactions related to the decline in the number of loans and the UPB of the long-term mortgage portfolio as compared to 2015. Servicing income, net.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, servicing fees, net was $13.7 million compared to $6.1 million in the comparable 2015 period.  The increase in servicing fees, net was the result of the servicing portfolio increasing 118% to an average balance of $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to an average balance of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015.   The increase in the average balance of the servicing portfolio is a result of servicing retained loan sales of $12.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 partially offset by a bulk sale of MSRs of approximately $815.0 million. Loss on mortgage servicing rights, net.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, loss on MSRs was $36.4 million compared to $18.6 million in the comparable 2015 period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 50 Table of Contents we recorded a $24.4 million loss from a change in fair value of MSRs primarily the result of $2.9 billion in prepayments due to the low mortgage interest rate environment during 2016 which resulted in an increase in actual prepayments as well as prepayment speed assumptions.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of our successful retention efforts, we recaptured and refinanced approximately 76% of these prepayments at a lower coupon rate and thus a higher servicing value.   Despite the mark-to-market (MTM) loss from loan prepayments recorded as a loss on MSRs, there was also a corresponding income from the recaptured loan with a higher MSR value recognized in gain on sale of loans, net in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a $9.7 million loss on sale of mortgage servicing rights related to refunds of premiums to investors for loan payoffs associated with sales of servicing rights in previous periods as compared to $8.0 million in the comparable 2015 period as well as a $1.0 million loss on the sale of $815.0 million UPB of MSRs.  In addition to the loss, we had a $1.4 million decrease in realized and unrealized losses from hedging instruments related to MSRs.  During the third quarter of 2016, we amended a previous MSR sale agreement, extending the early prepayment protection, in return allowing us to solicit the sold portfolio.  As a result, we booked a $7.5 million charge during the third quarter related to this amendment.    The amendment gave us the option to terminate the agreement with a 90 day notification.  In November, we exercised our option to terminate the agreement.

Personnel expense decreased $34.9 million to $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in commission expense due to a decrease in loan originations as well as staff reductions made in the first quarter of 2017.  With the decline in origination volumes in the first quarter of 2017 we made staff reductions. As a result, average headcount decreased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Business promotion totaled $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $42.6 million for the comparable period of 2016.  Our centralized call center purchases leads and promotes its business through radio and television advertisements.  During 2017, business promotion only declined $2.3 million or 5%, despite the 45% decrease in production due to efforts to increase NonQM and purchase money production with the reduction in refinance activity as a result of the increase in interest rates as compared to 2016. General, administrative and other expenses increased to $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $33.8 million for the same period in 2016.  The increase was primarily related to a $5.1 million increase in legal and professional fees associated with defending litigation, as discussed in Item 8. Note 17  -  Commitments and Contingencies of this Form 10-K, and $351 thousand in goodwill impairment related to the wind down of certain services within our real estate services segment.  Partially offsetting the increase was a $637 thousand decrease in other general and administrative expenses, a $436 thousand decrease in premises and equipment and a $406 thousand decrease in data processing expense. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, as part of the acquisition of CCM, we record accretion of the contingent consideration liability from the close of the transaction in March 2015 through the end of the earn-out period in December 2017, which increases the contingent consideration liability. The estimated contingent consideration liability is based on discounted cash flows which represent the time value of money of the liability during the earn-out period.  In 2017, accretion increased the contingent consideration liability by $2.1 million as 51 Table of Contents compared to $7.0 million during 2016.  The reduction in accretion is due to the reduction in the estimated future pre-tax earnings as compared to projections in 2016.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the accretion will no longer be recognized. We recorded a $13.3 million change in fair value associated with a decrease in the contingent consideration liability for 2017 related to updated assumptions including current market. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was related to margin compression as well as a reduction in origination volume. The fair value of contingent consideration changed from quarter to quarter based upon actual experience and updated assumptions used to forecast pre-tax earnings for CCM.  The decrease in the contingent consideration liability resulted in an increase in earnings of $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  At December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance of the contingent consideration was $554 thousand which was paid in February 2018.

The increase in expenses is due to the CCM acquisition and the presentation of CCM operating expenses in the first quarter of 2015 before we closed the transaction on March 31, 2015.  We received the economic benefit of the CCM transaction from the beginning of 2015 but did not hire the employees of CCM or incur direct operating expenditures of CCM until the transaction closed on March 31, 2015.  Accordingly, operating expenses for CCM in the first quarter of 2015 were included within gain on sale of loans, net as loan origination costs in the consolidated statements of operations.  Beginning with the second quarter of 2015 the operating expenses of CCM were included in personnel, business promotion, general, administrative and other expense, as normally presented. Personnel expense increased $46.7 million to $124.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  In addition to the aforementioned presentation of CCM in 2015, the increase is primarily due to an increase in commission expense due to an increase in loan origination volumes as well as an increase in personnel related costs due to the addition of new personnel to accommodate the increase in mortgage loan volumes. Business promotion totaled $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $27.7 million for the comparable period of 2015.  Our centralized call center purchases leads and promotes its business through radio and television advertisements.  In addition to the aforementioned presentation of CCM in 2015, the increase in business promotion is primarily due to the focus on growing market share and geographic scope within the CashCall Mortgage retail channel as well as growth in the correspondent and wholesale lending channels. General, administrative and other expenses increased to $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $28.0 million for the same period in 2015. In addition to the aforementioned presentation of CCM in 2015, the increase was primarily related to a $1.9 million increase in data processing and information technology support, a $1.9 million increase in other general and administrative expenses, a $1.2 million increase in amortization of intangible and other assets and a $745 thousand increase in legal and professional fees. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, as part of the acquisition of CCM, we record accretion of the contingent consideration liability from the close of the transaction in March 2015 through the end of the earn-out period in December 2017, which increases the contingent consideration liability. The estimated contingent consideration liability is based on discounted cash flows which represent the time value of money of the liability during the earn-out period.  In 2016, accretion increased the contingent consideration liability by $7.0 million as compared to $8.1 million during 2015.  The reduction in accretion is due to the reduction in the estimated future 52 Table of Contents pre-tax earnings as compared to projections in 2015.  The accretion will continue to be a charge against earnings in future quarters until the end of the earn-out period in the fourth quarter of 2017. We recorded a $30.1 million change in fair value associated with an increase in the contingent consideration liability for 2016 related to updated assumptions including current market conditions and increased mortgage loan originations for CCM. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was related to the estimated increase in future pre-tax earnings of CCM over the remaining earn-out period of four quarters. The fair value of contingent consideration may change from quarter to quarter based upon actual experience and updated assumptions used to forecast pre-tax earnings for CCM.  Even though this projected increase in mortgage volume for CCM is favorable, it resulted in a corresponding charge to earnings of $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Interest expense is primarily interest paid on borrowings secured by mortgage assets, which include securitized mortgage borrowings and warehouse borrowings and to a lesser extent, interest expense paid on long - term debt, Convertible Notes, notes payable and line of credit. Interest income and interest expense during the period primarily represents the effective yield, based on the fair value of the trust assets and liabilities.

- sale and finance receivables. (2) 			 		 			 			Net interest spread is calculated by subtracting the weighted average yield on interest - bearing liabilities from the weighted average yield on interest - earning assets. (3) 			 		 			 			Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest spread by total average interest - earning assets. Net interest spread increased $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily attributable to an increase in the net interest spread between loans held-for-sale and finance receivables and their related warehouse borrowings, a decrease in interest expense from the conversion of the Convertible Notes in January 2016 and a decrease in interest expense related to the payoff of the Term Financing.  Offsetting the increase in net spread was a decrease in the net interest spread on the securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings, an increase in the interest expense on the long-term debt as well as an increase in interest expense as a result of the MSR financing facilities.  As a result, net interest margin increased to 0.10% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 0.06% for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the yield on interest-earning assets decreased to 5.38% from 5.52% in the comparable 2016 period. The yield on interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 5.23% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 5.41% for the comparable 2016 period. In connection with the fair value accounting for securitized mortgage collateral and borrowings and long-term debt, interest income and interest expense is recognized using effective yields based on estimated fair values for these instruments. The decrease in yield for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings is primarily related to increased prices on mortgage-backed bonds which resulted in a decrease in yield as compared to the previous period. 54 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31,  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2016

(2) 			 		 			 			Net interest spread is calculated by subtracting the weighted average yield on interest - bearing liabilities from the weighted average yield on interest - earning assets. (3) 			 		 			 			Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest spread by total average interest - earning assets. Net interest spread increased $844 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily attributable to an increase in the net interest spread on securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings, an increase in the net interest spread between loans held-for-sale and finance receivables and their related warehouse borrowings and a decrease in interest expense on the convertible debt.  The decrease in interest expense from the Convertible Notes is due to the conversion of the Notes in the first quarter of 2016.  Offsetting the increase in net spread was an increase in interest expense on the long-term debt and term financing.  As a result, net interest margin increased to 0.06% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 0.04% for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the yield on interest-earning assets increased to 5.52% from 5.19% in the comparable 2015 period. The yield on interest-bearing liabilities increased to 5.41% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 5.11% for the comparable 2015 period. In connection with the fair value accounting for investment securities available-for-sale, securitized mortgage collateral and borrowings and long-term debt, interest income and interest expense is recognized using effective yields based on estimated fair values for these instruments. The increase in yield for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings is primarily related to decreased prices on mortgage-backed bonds which resulted in an increase in yield as compared to the previous period. Loss on extinguishment of debt We recorded a $1.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2017.  In May 2017, we exchanged 412,264 shares of common stock for the remaining trust preferred securities which had an aggregate liquidation amount of $8.5 million.  The value of the shares on the issuance date exceeded the carrying value of debt by $1.3 million. Change in the fair value of long - term debt Long - term debt (consisting of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes) is measured based upon an internal analysis which considers our own credit risk and discounted cash flow analyses. Improvements in our financial results and financial condition in the future could result in additional increases in the estimated fair value of the long - term debt, while deterioration in financial results and financial condition could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of the long - term debt. 55 Table of Contents Change in the fair value of long-term debt resulted in an expense of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to an expense of $14.4 million for the comparable 2016 period as a result of the increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt. The increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt during 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate attributable to an improvement in our credit risk profile, financial condition as well as an increase in LIBOR during 2017. Change in the fair value of long-term debt resulted in an expense of $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an expense of $8.7 million for the comparable 2015 period as a result of the increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt. The increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt during 2016 was primarily the result of a decrease in the discount rate attributable to an improvement in our own credit risk profile associated with our capital raise during the third quarter, improvement in our financial condition and results of operations from the mortgage lending segment during 2016.  The increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt during the 2015 was primarily the result of a decrease in the discount rate attributable to an improvement in our own credit risk profile, improvement in our financial condition and results of operations from the mortgage lending segment including the acquisition of CCM during the first quarter of 2015 as well as an increase in forward LIBOR interest rates during the second quarter of 2015.

The change in fair value of net trust assets, including trust REO was due to $7.4 million in gains on REO attributable to lower expected loss severities on properties held in the long-term mortgage portfolio during the period, partially offset by $1.2 million in losses from changes in fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings and securitized mortgage collateral primarily associated with an increase in LIBOR. The change in fair value related to our net trust assets (residual interests in securitizations) was a loss of $304 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in fair value of net trust assets, including trust REO was due to $5.9 million in losses on REO during the period attributed to higher expected loss severities on properties held in the long-term mortgage portfolio during the period, partially offset by $5.6 million in gains from changes in fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings and securitized mortgage collateral primarily associated with a decrease in LIBOR as well as updated assumptions on certain later vintage trusts with improved performance. The change in fair value related to our net trust assets was a loss of $304 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a loss of $5.6 million in the comparable 2015 period. The change in fair value of net trust assets, including trust REO was due to $6.6 million  in losses on REO during the period attributed to higher expected loss severities on properties held in the long - term mortgage portfolio primarily during the period, partially offset by $957 thousand in gains from changes in fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings, securitized mortgage collateral and investment securities available - for - sale primarily associated with lower interest rates during 2015 and updated assumptions of decreased collateral losses during 2015. Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act).  The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate and business deductions. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. Under FASB ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized 56 Table of Contents in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.  As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, we re-measured the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 at the rate at which they are expected to reverse in the future and recognized a tax expense of $89.5 million, which was offset by a $66.4 million change in the valuation allowance and other items resulting in income tax expense of $20.1 million in 2017.  We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. We recorded income tax expense (benefit) of $20.1 million, $1.1 million and $(21.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2017,  2016 and 2015, respectively. The income tax expense of $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily the result of income tax expense due to a reduction in our deferred tax asset as a result of a reduction in future utilization, changes in tax rates due to the Tax Act re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, amortization of the deferred charge and state income taxes from states where we donot have net operating loss carryforwards or state minimum taxes, including AMT. The income tax expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily the result of the amortization of the deferred charge, federal AMT and state income taxes from states where we do not have net operating loss carryforwards or state minimum taxes, including AMT. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a deferred income tax benefit of $24.4 million primarily the result of a reversal of valuation allowance partially offset by federal alternative minimum tax (AMT), amortization of the deferred charge and state income taxes from states where we do not have net operating loss carryforwards or state minimum taxes, including AMT. In accordance with FASB ASC 810 - 10 - 45 - 8, we record a deferred charge representing income tax expense on inter - company profits that resulted from the sale of mortgages from taxable subsidiaries to IMH in prior years. The deferred charge represents the deferral of income tax expense on inter - company profits that resulted from the sale of mortgages from taxable subsidiaries to IMH prior to 2008. The deferred charge is amortized and/or impaired, which does not result in any tax liability to be paid. The deferred charge is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is amortized as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. We recorded a tax expense in the amount of $858 thousand,  $1.3 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017,  2016 and 2015 respectively, related to the deferred charge impairment, which did not result in any tax liability to be paid.  In the first quarter of 2018, with the adoption of FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-16, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory"",  we will eliminate the remaining $7.8 million of deferred charge with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. As of December 31, 2017, we had estimated federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $619.9  million. Federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2027.  As of December 31, 2017, the estimated Federal NOL carryforward expiration schedule is as follows (in millions): Tax Year Established 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Amount 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Expiration Date 				 			 					 						12/31/2007 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 228.8 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2027 				 			 					 						12/31/2008 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 3.6 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2028 				 			 					 						12/31/2009 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 101.6 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2029 				 			 					 						12/31/2010 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 89.7 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2030 				 			 					 						12/31/2011 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 44.1 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2031 				 			 					 						12/31/2012 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2032 				 			 					 						12/31/2013 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 28.5 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2033 				 			 					 						12/31/2014 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2034 				 			 					 						12/31/2015 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 30.5 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2035 				 			 					 						12/31/2016 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 55.0 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2036 				 			 					 						12/31/2017 * 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 38.1 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						12/31/2037 				 			 					 						Total Federal NOLs 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 619.9 *NOL amounts are estimates until final tax return is filed in October 2018.

Our net deferred tax assets declined to $4.3 million at December 31, 2017, as a result of the reduction in projected future utilization, changes in tax rates due to the Tax Act re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and an increase in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the amortization of goodwill.  We recorded a valuation allowance against our remaining net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 as it is more likely than not that not all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The valuation allowance is based on the management's assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, may not be realized in the foreseeable future due to objective negative evidence that we may not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets. We are subject to federal income taxes as a regular (Subchapter C) corporation and file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for qualifying subsidiaries. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. In determining the adequacy of the valuation allowance, we consider all forms of evidence, including: (1) historic earnings or losses; (2) the ability to realize deferred tax assets through carry back to prior periods; (3) anticipated taxable income resulting from the reversal of taxable temporary differences; (4) tax planning strategies; and (5) anticipated future earnings exclusive of the reversal of taxable temporary differences.

The  $174.9  million decrease is primarily due to a $134.2 million decrease in premiums from the sale of mortgage loans, a $72.2 million decrease in premiums from servicing retained loan sales, a $19.5  million increase in realized and unrealized net losses on derivative instruments and a $1.2 million increase in provision for repurchases.  Partially offsetting the reduction was a $43.9 million decrease in direct origination expenses and an $8.4 million increase in mark-to-market gains on LHFS. The overall decrease in gain on sale of loans, net was primarily due to a 45% decrease in volumes as 58 Table of Contents well as a decrease in gain on sale margins.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, we originated and sold $7.1 billion and $6.9 billion of loans, respectively, as compared to $12.9 billion and $12.8 billion of loans originated and sold, respectively, during the same period in 2016.  Margins decreased to approximately 192 bps for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 241 bps for the same period in 2016 due to margin compression across all three channels as a result of the increase in interest rates as compared to 2016 as well as an increase in competition for volume. For the year ended December 31, 2017, servicing fees, net was $31.9 million compared to $13.7 million in the comparable 2016 period.  The increase in servicing fees, net was the result of the servicing portfolio increasing 91% to an average balance of $14.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an average balance of $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.   The increase in the average balance of the servicing portfolio is a result of servicing retained loan sales of $6.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017 partially offset by a bulk sale of MSRs of approximately $155.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, loss on MSRs was $35.9 million compared to $36.4 million in the comparable 2016 period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $37.9 million loss from a change in fair value of MSRs primarily the result of mark-to-market changes related to amortization as well as an increase in prepayments and prepayment speed assumptions.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had a $93 thousand loss on sale of mortgage servicing rights related to refunds of premiums to investors for loan payoffs partially offset by recoveries of previously written off holdbacks associated with sales of servicing rights in previous periods.   Partially offsetting the loss was a $2.1 million increase in realized and unrealized gains from hedging instruments related to MSRs. Personnel expense decreased $39.9 million to $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in commission expense due to a decrease in loan originations as well as staff reductions made in the first quarter of 2017.  With the decline in origination volumes in the first quarter of 2017 we made staff reductions. As a result, the average headcount of the mortgage lending division decreased 18% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Business promotion totaled $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $42.4 million for the comparable period of 2016.  Our centralized call center purchases leads and promotes its business through radio and television advertisements.  During 2017, business promotion only declined $2.2 million or 5%, despite the 45% decrease in production due to efforts to increase NonQM and purchase money production with the reduction in refinance activity as a result of the increase in interest rates as compared to 2016. General, administrative and other expenses decreased to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $20.3 million for the same period in 2016.  The decrease was primarily related to a $781 thousand decrease in in other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $692 thousand increase in occupancy expense. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, as part of the acquisition of CCM, we record accretion of the contingent consideration liability from the close of the transaction in March 2015 through the end of the earn-out period in December 2017, which increases the contingent consideration liability. The estimated contingent consideration liability is based on discounted cash flows which represent the time value of money of the liability during the earn-out period.  In 2017, accretion increased the contingent consideration liability by $2.1 million as compared to $7.0 million during 2016.  The reduction in accretion is due to the reduction in the estimated future pre-tax earnings as compared to projections in 2016.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the accretion will no longer be recognized. We recorded a $13.3 million change in fair value associated with a decrease in the contingent consideration liability for 2017 related to updated assumptions including current market. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was related to margin compression as well as a reduction in origination volume. The fair value of contingent consideration changed from quarter to quarter based upon actual experience and updated assumptions used to forecast pre-tax earnings for CCM.  The decrease in the contingent consideration liability resulted in an increase in earnings of $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  At December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance of the contingent consideration was $554 59 Table of Contents thousand which was paid in February 2018.

We received the economic benefit of the CCM transactions from the beginning of 2015 but did not hire the employees of CCM or incur direct operating expenditures of CCM until after the close of the transaction.  Accordingly, operating expenses for CCM in the first quarter of 2015 were included within gain on sale of loans, net as loan origination costs in the consolidated statements of operations.  Beginning with the second quarter of 2015 the operating expenses of CCM were included in personnel, business promotion, general, administrative and other expense, as normally presented. For the year ended December 31, 2016, gain on sale of loans, net were $311.0 million compared to $169.2 million in the comparable 2015 period. The $141.8 million increase is primarily due to increased volumes and gain on sale margins.   For the year ended December 31, 2016, we originated and sold $12.9 billion and $12.8 billion of loans, respectively, as compared to $9.3 billion and $9.2 billion of loans originated and sold, respectively, during the same period in 2015.  Margins increased to approximately 241 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 183 bps for the same period in 2015 due to a higher concentration of retail loans which have higher margins as well as the aforementioned expenses of CCM being included in gain on sale of loans, net in the first quarter of 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, servicing fees, net was $13.7 million compared to $6.1 million in the comparable 2015 period.  The increase in servicing fees, net was the result of the servicing portfolio increasing 118% to an average balance of $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to an average balance of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015.   The increase in the average balance of the servicing portfolio is a result of servicing retained loan sales of $12.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 partially offset by a bulk sale of MSRs of approximately $815.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, loss on mortgage servicing rights, net was $36.4 million compared to $18.6 million in the comparable 2015 period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $24.4 million loss from a change in fair value of MSRs primarily the result of $2.9 billion in prepayments due to the low mortgage interest rate environment during 2016 which resulted in an increase in actual prepayments as well as prepayment speed assumptions.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of our successful retention efforts, we recaptured and refinanced approximately 76% of these prepayments at a lower coupon rate and thus a higher servicing value.   Despite the MTM loss from loan prepayments recorded as a loss on MSRs, there was also corresponding income from the recaptured loan with a higher MSR value recognized in gain on sale of loans, net in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we had a $9.7 million loss on sale of mortgage servicing rights, net related to refunds of premiums to investors for loan payoffs associated with sales of servicing rights in previous periods as compared to $8.0 million in the comparable 2015 period as well as a $1.0 million loss on the sale of $815.0 million UPB of MSRs.  In addition to the loss we had a $1.4 million decrease in realized and unrealized losses from hedging instruments related to MSRs.  During the third quarter of 2016, we amended a previous MSR sale agreement, extending the early prepayment protection, in return allowing us to solicit the 60 Table of Contents sold portfolio.  As a result we booked a $7.5 million charge during the third quarter related to this amendment. The amendment gave us the option to terminate the agreement with a 90 day notification. In November, we exercised our option to terminate the agreement. Personnel expense increased $46.6 million to $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  In addition to the aforementioned presentation of CCM in 2015, the increase is primarily due to an increase in commission expense due to an increase in loan origination volumes as well as an increase in personnel related costs due to the addition of new personnel to accommodate the increase in mortgage loan volumes. Business promotion totaled $42.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $27.5 million for the comparable period of 2015.  Our centralized call center purchases leads and promotes its business through radio and television advertisements.  In addition to the aforementioned presentation of CCM in 2015, the increase in business promotion is primarily due to the focus on growing market share and geographic scope within the CashCall Mortgage retail channel as well as growth in the correspondent and wholesale lending channels. General, administrative and other expenses increased to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $15.8 million for the same period in 2015. In addition to the aforementioned presentation of CCM in 2015, the increase was primarily related to a $1.7 million increase in other general and administrative expenses, a $1.2 million increase in amortization of intangible and other assets, a $1.1 million increase in additional occupancy expense and a $981 thousand increase in data processing.  Partially offsetting the increase in general, administrative and other expenses was an $870 thousand decrease in legal and professional fees. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, as part of the acquisition of CCM, we record accretion of the contingent consideration liability from the close of the transaction in March 2015 through the end of the earn-out period in December 2017, which increases the contingent consideration liability. The estimated contingent consideration liability is based on discounted cash flows which represent the time value of money of the liability during the earn-out period.  In 2016, accretion increased the contingent consideration liability by $7.0 million as compared to $8.1 million during 2015.  The reduction in accretion is due to the reduction in the estimated future pre-tax earnings as compared to projections in 2015.  The accretion will continue to be a charge against earnings in future quarters until the end of the earn-out period in the fourth quarter of 2017. We recorded a $30.1 million change in fair value associated with an increase in the contingent consideration liability for 2016 related to updated assumptions including current market conditions and increased mortgage loan originations for CCM. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was related to the estimated increase in future pre-tax earnings of CCM over the remaining earn-out period of four quarters. The fair value of contingent consideration may change from quarter to quarter based upon actual experience and updated assumptions used to forecast pre-tax earnings for CCM.  Even though this projected increase in mortgage volume for CCM is favorable, it resulted in a corresponding charge to earnings of $30.1 million for 2016.

The $2.5 million decrease in real estate services fees, net was the result of a $1.3 million decrease in real estate and recovery fees and a $1.3 million decrease in loss mitigation fees partially offset by a $53 thousand increase in real estate service fees.  The $2.5 million decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in transactions related to the decline in the number of loans and the UPB of 61 Table of Contents the long-term mortgage portfolio as compared to 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the $3.2 million reduction in personnel expense was due to a reduction in personnel and personnel related costs as a result of a decrease in transactions related to the decline in the number of loans and the UPB of the long-term mortgage portfolio as compared to 2016. General, administrative and other expenses increased to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $746 thousand for the same period in 2016.  The increase was due to $351 thousand in goodwill impairment related to the wind down of certain services within our real estate services segment.

The $1.5 million decrease in real estate services fees, net was the result of a $1.8 million decrease in real estate and recovery fees and a $57 thousand decrease in real estate services partially offset by a $444 thousand increase in loss mitigation fees.  The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in transactions related to the decline in the number of loans and the UPB of the long-term mortgage portfolio as compared to 2015.  Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, personnel expense increased primarily due to increased loss mitigation efforts for the long - term mortgage portfolio.

Net interest income decreased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily attributable to a $1.8 million decrease in net interest spread on the long-term mortgage portfolio as well as a $265 thousand increase in interest expense on the long-term debt due to an increase in three-month LIBOR as compared to the prior year. During the second quarter of 2017, we exchanged 412,264 shares of common stock for trust preferred securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of $8.5 million.  Accrued and unpaid interest on the trust preferred securities was paid in cash in the aggregate amount of approximately $14 thousand.  We recorded a 62 Table of Contents $1.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to stock price appreciation after the agreed upon settlement and before the issuance date of the common stock. Change in the fair value of long-term debt resulted in an expense of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to an expense of $14.4 million for the comparable 2016 period as a result of the increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt. The increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt during 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate attributable to an improvement in our credit risk profile, financial condition as well as an increase in LIBOR during 2017. The change in fair value related to our net trust assets (residual interests in securitizations) was a gain of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in fair value of net trust assets, including trust REO was due to $7.4 million in gains on REO attributable to lower expected loss severities on properties held in the long-term mortgage portfolio during the period, partially offset by $1.2 million in losses from changes in fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings and securitized mortgage collateral primarily associated with an increase in LIBOR.

Net interest income increased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily attributable to a $1.7 million increase in net interest spread on the long-term mortgage portfolio due to an improvement in net interest income and cash flows in trusts with residual interests. Partially offsetting the increase in interest income was a $415 thousand increase in interest expense on the long-term debt due to an increase in 3 month LIBOR as compared to the prior year. Change in the fair value of long-term debt resulted in an expense of $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an expense of $8.7 million for the comparable 2015 period as a result of the increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt. The increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt during 2016 was primarily the result of a decrease in the discount rate attributable to an improvement in our own credit risk profile associated with our capital raise during the third quarter, improvement in our financial condition and results of operations from the mortgage lending segment during 2016.  The increase in the estimated fair value of long-term debt during the 2015 was primarily the result of a decrease in the discount rate attributable to an improvement in our own credit risk profile, improvement in our financial condition and results of operations from the mortgage lending segment including the acquisition of CCM during the first quarter of 2015 as well as an increase in forward LIBOR interest rates during the second quarter of 2015. The change in fair value related to our net trust assets (residual interests in securitizations) was a loss of $304 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in fair value of net trust assets, including trust REO was due to $5.9 million in losses on REO during the period attributed to higher expected loss severities on properties held in the long-term mortgage portfolio during the period, partially offset by $5.6 million in gains from changes in fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings, securitized mortgage collateral and investment securities available-for-sale primarily associated with a decrease in LIBOR as well as updated assumptions on certain later vintage trusts with improved performance. 63 Table of Contents Corporate For the Year Ended December 31,  				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						Increase 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						% 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2017 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						2016 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						(Decrease) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Change 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Interest expense 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (2,227) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (5,536) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 3,309 				 				 					 						  				 				 60 				 				 					 						% 				 			 					 						Other expenses 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (20,362) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (7,985) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (12,377) 				 				 					 						  				 				 (155) 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Net loss before income taxes 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (22,589) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (13,521) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 (9,068) 				 				 					 						  				 				 (67) 				 				 					 						% For the year ended December 31, 2017, interest expense decreased to $2.2 million as compared to $5.5 million for the comparable 2016 period. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.6 million decrease in interest expense related to the payoff of the Term Financing in February 2017 as well as a $637 thousand decrease in interest expense related to the conversion of the original $20.0 million Convertible Notes to common stock in January 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, other expenses increased to $20.4 million as compared to $8.0 million for the comparable 2016 period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in corporate expenses of $6.8 million during 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 and a reduction in allocated corporate expenses in other segments.  The increase in corporate expenses is due to a $5.3 million increase in legal and professional fees associated with defending litigation, as discussed in Item 8. Note 17  -  Commitments and Contingencies of this Form 10-K and a $1.6 million increase in personnel costs primarily associated with our increased investment in technology.

The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in interest expense from the $30.0 million Term Financing issued in June of 2015.  Partially offsetting the increase in interest expense was a $398 thousand decrease in interest expense related to the payoff of the short-term borrowings in 2015 and a $256 thousand decrease in interest expense related to the conversion of the Convertible Notes in January 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, other expenses increased to $8.0 million as compared to $7.5 million for the comparable 2015 period. The increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in legal expense and a $995 thousand increase in data processing.  Partially offsetting the increase was a $679 thousand decrease in occupancy expense, a $358 thousand increase in allocated corporate expenses. The growth of the mortgage lending division resulted in increased allocations of certain corporate costs due to increased headcount. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the year ended December 31, 2017, we funded our operations primarily from mortgage lending revenues and to a lesser extent real estate services fees and cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations.  Mortgage lending revenues include gains on sale of loans, net, and other mortgage related income, and real estate services fees including portfolio loss mitigation fees primarily generated from our long-term mortgage portfolio.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, we raised capital by issuing common stock as well as obtained MSR financing facilities, as further described below.  Additionally, we funded mortgage loan originations using warehouse facilities which are repaid once the loan is sold.  We may continue to manage our capital through the financing or sale of mortgage servicing rights.  We may also seek to raise capital by issuing debt or equity, including offering shares through the ""At-the-Market"" offering (ATM) program we initiated 64 Table of Contents in 2015. On August 17, 2017, IMC (Borrower), issued a Line of Credit Promissory Note with a lender  providing for a revolving line of credit of $30.0 million  (Freddie Mac Financing). The Borrower is able to borrow up to 55% of the fair market value of Freddie Mac pledged mortgage servicing rights. The Line of Credit has a term until May 31, 2018 and will automatically renew for subsequent one year periods unless the lender provides the Borrower 150 days' notice of its intention not to renew. Interest payments are payable monthly and accrue interest at the rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 4.0% and the balance of the obligation  may be prepaid at any time. The obligations under the Freddie Mac Financing are secured by Freddie Mac pledged mortgage servicing rights and Integrated Real Estate Services, Corp. is a guarantor.  At December 31, 2017, $10.0 million was outstanding under the Freddie Mac Financing and was secured by $58.3 million of mortgage servicing rights.  In February 2018, the maximum borrowing capacity of the revolving line of credit was increased to $50.0 million and the term was extended to January 31, 2019. On May 5, 2017, we entered into an exchange agreement pursuant to which we agreed to issue 412,264 shares of our common stock in exchange for trust preferred securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of $8.5 million issued by Impac Capital Trust #4.  Accrued and unpaid interest on the trust preferred securities was paid in cash in the aggregate amount of approximately $14 thousand.   The exchange was based on the carrying value of the trust preferred obligation which was $5.6 million at March 31, 2017 and an agreed upon stock price of $13.68 that determined a fixed number of shares to be issued in the exchange resulting in a discount to par of 34%.  However, because the market value of the common stock was $17.06 on the issuance date (measurement date), we recorded a $1.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2017.  The appreciation in stock price from the agreement date to the issuance date of the common stock resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt.   The annual interest savings will amount to approximately $400 thousand. On April 18, 2017, we received $56.0 million from the issuance of common stock in a registered direct offering (Offering) at a price of $12.66 per share. In the Offering, we issued an aggregate of 4,423,381 shares of common stock.  Net proceeds from the Offering were approximately $55.5 million after deducting the financial advisory fee and estimated aggregate offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Offering for general corporate purposes, including general administrative expenses and working capital and capital expenditures, development costs, strategic investments or possible acquisitions, or repayment of debt. In February 2017, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (Agreement) with a lender  providing for a revolving loan commitment of up to $40.0 million for a period of two years (Fannie Mae Financing) to finance MSRs.  We are able to borrow up to 55% of the fair market value of Fannie Mae pledged servicing rights.  Upon the two year anniversary of the Agreement, any amounts outstanding will automatically be converted into a term loan due and payable in full on the one year anniversary of the conversion date.  Interest payments are payable monthly and accrue interest at the rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR plus 4.0%. The balance of the obligation may be prepaid at any time. With the initial draw of $35.1 million, a portion of the proceeds were used to pay off the Term Financing (approximately $30.1 million) originally entered into in June 2015.  At December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance of the Fannie Mae Financing was $25.1 million and was secured by $67.3 million of mortgage servicing rights. During 2017, we paid approximately $19.3 million in contingent consideration payments related to the CCM acquisition for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first three quarters of 2017 earn-out periods. Additionally, the contingent consideration payment for the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately $554 thousand and was paid in February 2018.  These contingent consideration payments were based on the performance of the CCM division and over time the earn-out percentage declines. The fourth quarter 2016 earn-out percentage was 55% of the CCM division earnings, as defined. In 2017, the earn-out percentage decreased to 45% and terminated at the end of 2017. Our results of operations and liquidity are materially affected by conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage-related assets, as well as the broader financial markets and the general economy. Concerns over economic recession, geopolitical issues, unemployment, the availability and cost of financing, the mortgage market and real estate market conditions contribute to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets. Volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace may make it more 65 Table of Contents difficult for us to obtain financing or raise capital on favorable terms or at all. Our operations and profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain cost-effective financing.  It is important for us to originate and sell or securitize loans and, when doing so, sell mortgage servicing rights on a timely basis and at a profitable price.  Investors of ours have raised concerns about the prepayment speeds of our loans and this could result in adverse pricing or delays in our ability to sell or securitize loans and sell mortgage servicing rights timely and profitably. We believe that current cash balances, cash flows from our mortgage lending operations, the sale of mortgage servicing rights, real estate services fees generated from our long-term mortgage portfolio, and residual interest cash flows from our long-term mortgage portfolio are adequate for our current operating needs. We believe the mortgage and real estate services market is volatile, highly competitive and subject to increased regulation. Competition in mortgage lending comes primarily from mortgage bankers, commercial banks, credit unions and other finance companies which operate in our market area as well as throughout the United States. We compete for loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees we charge, the types of loans we originate and the quality of services we provide to borrowers, brokers and sellers. Additionally, competition for loss mitigation servicing, loan modification services and other portfolio services has increased. Our competitors include mega mortgage servicers, established subprime loan servicers, and newer entrants to the specialty servicing and recovery collections business. Efforts to market our ability to provide mortgage and real estate services for others is more difficult than many of our competitors because we have not historically provided such services to unrelated third parties, and we are not a rated primary or special servicer of residential mortgage loans as designated by a rating agency. Additionally, performance of the long-term mortgage portfolio is subject to the current real estate market and economic conditions. Cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations are sensitive to delinquencies, defaults and credit losses associated with the securitized loans. Losses in excess of current estimates will reduce the residual interest cash receipts from our long-term mortgage portfolio. While we continue to pay our obligations as they become due, the ability to continue to meet our current and long-term obligations is dependent upon many factors, particularly our ability to successfully operate our mortgage lending segment, real estate services segment and realizing cash flows from the long-term mortgage portfolio. Our future financial performance and profitability are dependent in large part upon the ability to expand our mortgage lending platform successfully. Sources of Liquidity Cash flows from our mortgage lending operations.  We receive loan fees from loan originations. Fee income consists of application and underwriting fees and fees on cancelled loans. These loan fees are offset by the related direct loan origination costs including broker fees related to our wholesale and correspondent channels. In addition, we generally recognize net interest income on loans held for sale from the date of origination through the date of disposition. We sell or securitize substantially all of the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market, with servicing rights released or retained. Loans are sold on a whole loan basis by entering into sales transactions with third - party investors in which we receive a premium for the loan and related servicing rights, if applicable. The mortgage lending operations sold $6.9 billion of mortgages through whole loan sales and securitizations during 2017. Additionally, the mortgage lending operations enter into IRLCs and utilize Hedging Instruments to hedge interest rate risk. We may be subject to pair - off gains and losses associated with these Hedging Instruments. Since we rely significantly upon loan sales to generate cash proceeds to repay warehouse borrowings and to create credit availability, any disruption in our ability to complete sales may require us to utilize other sources of financing, which, if available at all, may be on less favorable terms. In addition, delays in the disposition of our mortgage loans increase our risk by exposing us to credit and interest rate risk for this extended period of time. We receive servicing income net of subservicing cost and other related servicing expenses from our mortgage servicing portfolio. Additionally, we also may strategically sell MSRs to generate liquidity, keep the amount of capital invested in MSRs at acceptable levels and provide capital needed for further growth. During 2017, our mortgage servicing portfolio increased to $16.3 billion at December 31, 2017, as compared to $12.4 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was due to servicing retained loan sales of $6.1 billion partially offset by a bulk sale of NonQM MSRs totaling $155.9 million in UPB.  The increase in servicing fees, net was the result of the servicing portfolio increasing 91% to an average balance of $14.7 billion for the year 66 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an average balance of $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Fees from our real estate service business activities.  We earn fees from various real estate business activities, including loss mitigation, real estate disposition, monitoring and surveillance services and real estate brokerage. We provide services to investors, servicers and individual borrowers primarily by focusing on loss mitigation and performance of our long - term mortgage portfolio. Cash flows from our long - term mortgage portfolio (residual interests in securitizations).  We receive residual cash flows on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral after distributions are made to investors on securitized mortgage borrowings to the extent required credit enhancements are maintained and performance covenants are complied with for credit ratings on the securitized mortgage borrowings. These cash flows represent the difference between principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages, affected by the following:  			 		 			 			servicing and master servicing fees paid;  			 		 			 			premiums paid to mortgage insurers;  			 		 			 			cash payments / receipts on derivatives;  			 		 			 			interest paid on securitized mortgage borrowings;  			 		 			 			principal payments and prepayments paid on securitized mortgage borrowings;  			 		 			 			overcollateralization requirements;  			 		 			 			actual losses, net of any gains incurred upon disposition of other real estate owned or acquired in settlement of defaulted mortgages;  			 		 			 			unpaid interest shortfall; and  			 		 			 			basis risk shortfall. Additionally, we act as the master servicer for mortgages included in our long - term mortgage portfolio, which consists of CMO and REMIC securitizations. The master servicing fees we earn are generally 0.03% per annum (3 basis points) on the declining principal balances of these mortgages plus interest income on cash held in custodial accounts until remitted to investors, less any interest shortfall. However, due to the decline in interest rates, the interest income earned on cash held in custodial accounts has declined significantly. Uses of Liquidity Acquisition and origination of mortgage loans.  During 2017, the mortgage lending operations originated or acquired $7.1 billion of mortgage loans. Capital invested in mortgages is outstanding until we sell the loans, which is one of the reasons we attempt to sell within 10 - 15 days of acquisition or origination. Initial capital invested in mortgage loans includes premiums paid when mortgages are acquired and originated and our capital investment, or ""haircut,"" required upon financing, which is generally determined by the type of collateral provided and the warehouse facility terms. The mortgage lending operations acquired and originated $7.1 billion of residential mortgages, which were financed with warehouse borrowings at a haircut generally between 2% to 10% of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans. The haircuts are normally recovered from sales proceeds. At December 31, 2017, $10.0 million was outstanding under the Freddie Mac Financing and was secured by $58.3 million of mortgage servicing rights.  In February 2018, the maximum borrowing capacity of the revolving line of credit was increased to $50.0 million and the term was extended to January 31, 2019. 67 Table of Contents Investment in mortgage servicing rights.  As part of our business plan, we invest in mortgage servicing rights through the sale of mortgage loans on a servicing retained basis. During 2017, we capitalized $56.0 million in mortgage servicing rights from selling $6.1 billion in loans with servicing retained. Partially offsetting this investment was the sale of $895 thousand in servicing rights (approximately $155.9 million of mortgage loans) from the servicing portfolio. Cash flows from financing facilities and other lending relationships.  We primarily fund our mortgage originations, as well as re - warehouse customers, through warehouse facilities with third - party lenders which are primarily with national and regional banks. During 2017, the warehouse facilities borrowing capacity amounted to $960.0 million, of which $575.4 million was outstanding at December 31, 2017. The warehouse facilities are secured by and used to fund single - family residential mortgage loans until such loans are sold. The warehouse facilities agreements contain certain covenants which we are required to satisfy. In order to mitigate the liquidity risk associated with warehouse borrowings, we attempt to sell our mortgage loans within 10 - 15 days from acquisition or origination. We have recently entered into revolving lines of credit to finance our MSR portfolio.  The MSR financings are secured by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae servicing rights.  We are able to borrow up to 55% of the fair market value of the servicing rights.  At December 31, 2017, the balance outstanding on the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae facilities was $10.0 million and $25.1 million, respectively, which were secured by $58.3 million and $67.3 million, respectively, of mortgage servicing rights. Our ability to meet liquidity requirements and the financing needs of our customers is subject to the renewal of our warehouse facilities or obtaining other sources of financing, if required, including additional debt or equity from time to time. Any decision our lenders or investors make to provide available financing to us in the future will depend upon a number of factors, including:  			 		 			 			our compliance with the terms of existing warehouse lines and credit arrangements, including any financial covenants;  			 		 			 			the ability to obtain waivers upon any noncompliance;  			 		 			 			our financial performance;  			 		 			 			industry and market trends in our various businesses;  			 		 			 			the general availability of, and rates applicable to, financing and investments;  			 		 			 			our lenders or investors resources and policies concerning loans and investments; and  			 		 			 			the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities. Repurchase Reserve.  When we sell loans through whole loan sales we are required to make normal and customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser. Our whole loan sale agreements generally require us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser. In addition, we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale. From time to time, investors have requested us to repurchase loans or to indemnify them against losses on certain loans which the investors believe either do not comply with applicable representations or warranties or defaulted shortly after its purchase. We record an estimated reserve for these losses at the time the loan is sold, and adjust the reserve to reflect the estimated loss. Financing Activities MSR Financing.  On August 17, 2017, we entered into a Line of Credit Promissory Note with a lender providing for a revolving line of credit of $30.0 million  (Freddie Mac Financing). We are able to borrow up to 68 Table of Contents 55% of the fair market value of Freddie Mac pledged mortgage servicing rights. The Line of Credit has a term until May 31, 2018 and will automatically renew for subsequent one year periods unless the lender provides the Borrowers 150 days' notice of its intention not to renew. Interest payments are payable monthly and accrue interest at the rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 4.0% and the balance of the obligation may be prepaid at any time.  At December 31, 2017, $10.0 million was outstanding under the Freddie Mac Financing.    In February 2018, the maximum borrowing capacity of the revolving line of credit was increased to $50.0 million and the term was extended to January 31, 2019. On February 10, 2017, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (Agreement) with a lender providing for a revolving loan commitment of $40.0 million for a period of two years (Fannie Mae Financing).  We are able to borrow up to 55% of the fair market value of Fannie Mae pledged servicing rights.  Upon the two year anniversary of the Agreement, any amounts outstanding will automatically be converted into a term loan due and payable in full on the one year anniversary of the conversion date.  Interest payments are payable monthly and accrue interest at the rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR plus 4.0% and the balance of the obligation may be prepaid at any time.  We initially drew down $35.1 million, and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the Term Financing (approximately $30.1 million) originally entered into in June 2015 as discussed below.  We also paid the lender an origination fee of $100 thousand, which is deferred and amortized over the life of the Fannie Mae Financing.  At December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance of the Fannie Mae Financing was $25.1 million and was secured by $67.3 million of mortgage servicing rights. Term Financing.  In June 2015, we entered into a Loan Agreement with a Lender that provided a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $30.0 million. Interest on the Term Financing accrued at a rate of LIBOR plus 8.5% per annum. At December 31, 2016, the interest rate was 9.2% on the term financing. In June 2016, the maturity of the Term Financing was extended to June 16, 2017 and we paid an additional $100 thousand extension fee, which was amortized using the effective yield method over the life of the term financing.  In February 2017, the proceeds from the Fannie Mae Financing were used to pay off the Term Financing. Long - term Debt (Trust Preferred Securities and Junior Subordinated Notes).  On May 5, 2017, we agreed to exchange 412,264 shares of its common stock for the remaining Trust Preferred Securities which had an aggregate liquidation amount of $8.5 million issued by Impac Capital Trust #4.  The interest rate on the Trust Preferred Securities was a variable rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.75% per annum.  At the time of the exchange, the interest rate was 4.92%. The exchange was based on the carrying value of the trust preferred obligation, which was $5.6 million at March 31, 2017, and an agreed upon stock price that determined a fixed number of shares to be issued in the exchange.  However, because the measurement date of the exchange was the date the common stock was issued when the market price of the common stock was $17.06, we recorded a $1.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt for the difference in stock price from the agreed upon stock price to the stock price on the issuance date of the common stock. The Junior Subordinated Notes are redeemable at par at any time and require quarterly distributions initially at a fixed rate of 2.00% per annum through December 2013 with increases of 1.00% per year through 2017. Starting in 2018, the interest rates become variable at 3 - month LIBOR plus 3.75% per annum. At December 31, 2017, the interest rate was 6.0%. The Junior Subordinated Notes had an outstanding principal balance of $62.0 million at December 31, 2017 with a stated maturity of March 2034. We are current on all interest payments. At December 31, 2017, long - term debt had an outstanding principal balance of $62.0 million with an estimated fair value of $45.0 million and is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as long - term debt. Convertible Notes.    In January 2016, pursuant to the terms of the $20.0 million Convertible Promissory Notes issued in April 2013 (the Notes), we elected to exercise our option to convert the Notes to common stock. The conversion resulted in an aggregate of 1,839,080 shares of common stock being issued to the Note holders.  As a result of the transaction, we converted $20.0 million of debt into equity and paid interest through April 2016. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of the transaction. In May 2015, we issued an additional $25.0 million Convertible Promissory Notes (2015 Convertible Notes). The 2015 Convertible Notes mature on or before May 9, 2020 and accrue interest at a rate of 7.5% per annum, to be paid quarterly. We had approximately $50 thousand in transaction costs, which were deferred and amortized over the life of the 2015 Convertible Notes. 69 Table of Contents Operating activities.  Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(137.9) million for 2017 as compared to $65.5 million for 2016 and $30.7 million for 2015, primarily due to the timing of originations and sales of loans held - for - sale between 2017 and 2015. During 2017,  2016 and 2015, the primary sources of cash in operating activities were cash received from fees generated by our mortgage and real estate service business activities, cash received from mortgage lending and excess cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations offset by operating expenses. Investing activities.  Net cash provided by investing activities was $677.5 million for 2017 as compared to $641.9 million for 2016 and $714.4 million for 2015. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the primary source of cash from investing activities was provided by principal repayments on our securitized mortgage collateral, the sale of mortgage servicing rights, proceeds from the liquidation of REO. Financing activities.  Net cash used in financing activities was $546.5 million for 2017 as compared to $699.7 million for 2016 and $722.7 million for 2015. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for principal repayments on securitized mortgage borrowings,  repayment of term financing and payment of the contingent consideration. Partially offsetting the cash used in financing activities was cash provided by net borrowings under warehouse agreements, proceeds from the issuance of common stock, borrowings under the term and MSR financings and convertible notes. Inflation.  The consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, inflation had no significant impact on our revenues or net income. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater effect on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates, since interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements When we sell or broker loans through whole - loan sales, we are required to make normal and customary representations and warranties to the loan originators or purchasers, including guarantees against early payment defaults typically 90 days, and fraudulent misrepresentations by the borrowers. Our agreements generally require us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser. In addition, we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale. Because the loans are no longer on our balance sheet, the representations and warranties are considered a guarantee. During 2017, we sold $6.9 billion of loans subject to representations and warranties compared to $12.8 billion sold in 2016 and $9.2 billion sold in 2015. At December 31, 2017, we had $6.0 million in repurchase reserve as compared to a reserve of $5.4 million as December 31, 2016. See disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under ""Commitments and Contingencies"" for other arrangements that qualify as off balance sheet arrangements. 70 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017: Payments Due by Period 				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Less Than 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						One to 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Three to 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						More Than 				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Total 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						One Year 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Three Years 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Five Years 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Five Years 				 			 					 						Warehouse borrowings (1) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 575,363 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 575,363 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						   -  				 			 					 						MSR financings 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 35,133 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 10,000 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 25,133 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 			 					 						Lease commitments (2) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 33,952 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 6,033 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 10,234 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 9,361 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 8,324 				 			 					 						Contingent consideration (3) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 554 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 554 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 			 					 						2015 Convertible notes (1) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 24,974 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 24,974 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 			 					 						Junior subordinated notes (1) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 62,000 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						   -  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 62,000 				 			 					 						Securitized mortgage borrowings (4) 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 6,339,663 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 581,553 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 886,731 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 632,432 				 				 					 						     				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 4,238,947 				 			 					 						Total contractual obligations and commitments 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 7,071,639 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 1,173,503 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 947,072 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 641,793 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						$ 				 				 					 						 4,309,271 (1) 			 		 			 			For a description of terms of the Warehouse borrowings,  2015 Convertible notes and Junior subordinated notes, see Note 9. - Debt in the accompanying Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In addition to the above contractual obligations, we also had commitments to originate mortgage loans of $398.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Commitments to originate mortgage loans do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements as some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon and, therefore, those commitments have been excluded from the table above. Such commitments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.","ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate risk arises from the financial instruments and positions we hold. This includes mortgage loans held for sale, MSRs and derivative financial instruments. These risks are regularly monitored by executive management that identify and manage the sensitivity of earnings or capital to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives. Our principal market exposure is to interest rate risk, specifically changes in long-term Treasury rates and mortgage interest rates due to their impact on mortgage-related assets and commitments. We are also exposed to changes in short-term interest rates, such as LIBOR, on certain variable rate borrowings including our term financing and mortgage warehouse borrowings. We anticipate that such interest rates will remain our primary benchmark for market risk for the foreseeable future. Our business is subject to variability in results of operations in both the mortgage origination and mortgage servicing activities due to fluctuations in interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, we would expect our mortgage production activities' results of operations to be positively impacted by higher loan origination volumes and gain on sale margins. Furthermore, with declining rates, we would expect the market value of our MSRs to decline due to higher actual and projected loan prepayments related to our loan servicing portfolio. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, we would expect a negative impact on the results of operations of our mortgage production activities but a positive impact on the market values of our MSRs. The interaction between the results of operations of our mortgage activities is a core component of our overall interest rate risk strategy. We utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of MSRs and the impact of 71 Table of Contents parallel interest rate shifts on MSRs. The primary assumptions in this model are prepayment speeds, discount rates, costs of servicing and default rates. However, this analysis ignores the impact of interest rate changes on certain material variables, such as the benefit or detriment on the value of future loan originations, non-parallel shifts in the spread relationships between MBS, swaps and U.S. Treasury rates and changes in primary and secondary mortgage market spreads. We use a forward yield curve, which we believe better presents fair value of MSRs because the forward yield curve is the market's expectation of future interest rates based on its expectation of inflation and other economic conditions. Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) represent an agreement to extend credit to a mortgage loan applicant, or an agreement to purchase a loan from a third-party originator, whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to funding. Our mortgage loans held for sale, which are held in inventory awaiting sale into the secondary market, and our interest rate lock commitments, are subject to changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the commitment through the sale of the loan into the secondary market. As such, we are exposed to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of the lock commitment through the earlier of (i) the lock commitment cancellation or expiration date; or (ii) the date of sale into the secondary mortgage market. Loan commitments generally range between 15 and 60 days; and our holding period of the mortgage loan from funding to sale is typically within 20 days. We manage the interest rate risk associated with our outstanding IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale by entering into derivative loan instruments such as forward loan sales commitments or To-Be-Announced mortgage backed securities (TBA Forward Commitments). We expect these derivatives will experience changes in fair value opposite to changes in fair value of the derivative IRLCs and mortgage loans held-for-sale, thereby reducing earnings volatility. We take into account various factors and strategies in determining the portion of the mortgage pipeline (derivative loan commitments) and mortgage loans held for sale we want to economically hedge. Our expectation of how many of our IRLCs will ultimately close is a key factor in determining the notional amount of derivatives used in hedging the position. Mortgage loans held-for-sale are financed by our warehouse lines of credit which generally carry variable rates. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried on our balance sheet on average for only 7 to 25 days after closing and prior to being sold. As a result, we believe that any negative impact related to our variable rate warehouse borrowings resulting from a shift in market interest rates would not be material to our consolidated financial statements. Sensitivity Analysis We have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of market interest rates. We assess this risk based on changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact on fair values based on hypothetical changes (increases and decreases) in interest rates. Our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including market volatility and the liquidity of the markets. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. We used December 31, 2017 market rates on our instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis. The estimates are based on the market risk sensitivity and assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves. Management uses sensitivity analysis, such as those summarized below, based on a hypothetical 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, to monitor the risks associated with changes in interest rates. We believe the use of a 50 basis point shift up and down (100 basis point range) is appropriate given the relatively short time period that the mortgage loans pipeline is held on our balance sheet and exposed to interest rate risk (during the processing, underwriting and closing stages of the mortgage loans which can last up to approximately 60 days). We also actively manage our risk management strategy for our mortgage loans pipeline (through the use of economic hedges such as forward loan sale commitments and mandatory delivery commitments) and generally adjust our hedging position daily. In analyzing the interest rate risks associated with our MSRs, management also uses multiple sensitivity analyses (hypothetical 25 and 50 basis point increases and decreases) to review the interest rate risk associated with our MSRs. 72 Table of Contents At a given point in time, the overall sensitivity of our mortgage loans pipeline is impacted by several factors beyond just the size of the pipeline. The composition of the pipeline, based on the percentage of IRLC's compared to mortgage loans held for sale, the age and status of the IRLC's, the interest rate movement since the IRLC's were entered into, the channels from which the IRLC's originate, and other factors all impact the sensitivity. These sensitivities are hypothetical and presented for illustrative purposes only. Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in fair value may not be linear. The following table summarizes the estimated changes in the fair value of our mortgage pipeline, MSRs and related derivatives that are sensitive to interest rates as of December 31, 2017 given hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve: Changes in Fair Value 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Down 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Down 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Up 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						Up 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						50 bps 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						25 bps 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						25 bps 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						50 bps 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Total mortgage pipeline (1)  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (635) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (293) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 96 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 160 				 				 					 						  				 			 					 						Mortgage servicing rights (2)  				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (19,729) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 (9,207) 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 7,860 				 				 					 						  				 				 					 						 14,142 (1) 			 		 			 			Represents unallocated mortgage loans held for sale, IRLCs and hedging instruments that are considered ""at risk"" for purposes of illustrating interest rate sensitivity.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The information required by this Item 8 is incorporated by reference to Impac Mortgage Holdings, Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements and Independent Auditors' Report beginning at page F - 1 of this Form 10 - K.","ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a - 15(e) or 15d - 15(e)) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's management, with the participation of its chief executive officer (CEO) and its chief financial officer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017. Based on that evaluation, the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of that date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 73 Table of Contents Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Section 13a - 15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (COSO). Based on the criteria established by COSO, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision - making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by improper management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost - effective control system, there is a risk that material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and will not be detected on a timely basis. Squar Milner LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 - K, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 74 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Impac Mortgage Holdings, Inc.

Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 75 Table of Contents /s/ SQUAR MILNER LLP Newport Beach, California March 15, 2018 76 Table of Contents","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000298/0001558370-18-002168-index.html"
"SCHWEITZER MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL INC","10-K","2018","1","Item 1. Business Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors. For a discussion of important factors that could cause our results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements, please refer to Part I, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" and Part I, Item 7 ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" below. GENERAL Background Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. (referred to, with its consolidated subsidiaries, as ""we"", ""us"", ""our"", the ""Company"", ""SWM INTL"" or ""SWM"" unless the context indicates otherwise) is a multinational producer of specialty materials, including papers, nets and films headquartered in the United States of America (the ""U.S."").  Since October 2015, the Company has operated under two reportable segments: Advanced Materials & Structures (""AMS""), which manufactures resin-based products used in specialty applications in the filtration, infrastructure and construction, transportation, industrial, and medical end-markets, and Engineered Papers (""EP""), which produces cigarette papers and reconstituted tobacco products for cigarette and cigar manufacturers, as well as various other non-tobacco paper products. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark Corporation (""Kimberly-Clark"").  On November 30, 1995, Kimberly-Clark transferred its tobacco-related paper and other specialty paper products businesses conducted in the U.S., France and Canada to the Company and distributed all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to its stockholders (the ""spin-off"").  As a result, the Company became an independent public company.  We conduct business in over 90 countries and operate 23 production locations worldwide, with facilities in the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada, France, Luxembourg, Russia, Brazil, China, Belgium and Poland. Our principal executive office is located at 100 North Point Center East, Suite 600, Alpharetta, Georgia 30022-8246 and our telephone number is (800) 514-0186. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") under the symbol ""SWM"". Strategic Transformation - Overview Through 2013, the Company operated as a tobacco-centric paper operation.  In late 2012, SWM's management and Board of Directors elected to pursue a strategic transformation by increasing profit streams outside the tobacco industry through business acquisitions, while carefully managing the profitable but mature tobacco operations.  Over time, this strategy was intended to counterbalance the expected long-term pressures of the tobacco industry and transform SWM into a more diversified and growth-oriented enterprise while maintaining its company-wide focus on several underlying themes: technical expertise in high-performance specialty materials, collaborative customer relationships, and operational excellence. The Company selectively targeted acquisition candidates that served diversified and growing end-markets, generated profitability associated with premium differentiated products, and had leading and defensible competitive positions in their core product categories. In addition, management believed many acquisition targets would have unique synergy opportunities when combined with the assets and capabilities of SWM, such as a global infrastructure and a robust operational excellence program, and ultimately, synergies with other similar companies acquired by SWM. 1 Pursuant to this strategy, management has used free cash flow and liquidity available through our credit facility to support growth investments.  From 2013 to 2017 the Company invested a total of approximately $850 million acquiring three primary businesses, DelStar, Argotec, and Conwed, and making two ""bolt-on"" acquisitions.  These businesses together now comprise the Advanced Materials & Structures segment, which generated over $430 million in net sales in 2017.  The combination of AMS with non-tobacco sales in our paper business, resulted in total non-tobacco sales representing 51% of the Company's total revenue in 2017, up from approximately 6% prior to these strategic actions.  During this 5-year period, the EP segment has remained the source of the majority of the Company's cash flow, enabling the growth investments in the AMS segment and supporting steadily growing dividends to shareholders; the Company has paid more than $232 million in dividends since 2013. Strategic Transformation - Creating the AMS Growth Platform In December 2013, the Company acquired DelStar, Inc. (""DelStar""), a manufacturer of specialty resin-based nets, films and non-wovens, focused on the filtration, medical, and industrial end-markets. DelStar established SWM's presence in new industries and added a portfolio of high-value technologies. Management also believed DelStar could benefit from SWM's global footprint, Operational Excellence program, and ability to fund growth investments. In October 2015, the Company acquired Argotec Intermediate Holdings LLC (""Argotec""), a manufacturer of specialty urethane films for applications primarily in the transportation end-market. A key growth driver was increasing demand for surface protection films used for automotive paint protection and glass lamination. This business also serves customers in the medical and industrial end-markets. From a technology standpoint, Argotec added to SWM's growing resin extrusion capabilities and added scale to the AMS growth platform. In January 2017, SWM acquired Conwed Plastics LLC (""Conwed""), a producer of specialty resin-based netting. Conwed's similarities to the Company's existing netting production assets presented a compelling opportunity to drive synergies through footprint rationalization, procurement, and organizational realignment. Although operationally similar to AMS' existing assets, Conwed added further end-market diversification, with approximately 75% of Conwed's sales serving the infrastructure and construction end-markets. The remaining 25% of sales were split between filtration and industrial end-markets, which also complemented the existing AMS business. The acquisitions described above comprise the AMS segment. The Company believes that these businesses offer long-term growth opportunities across a broad set of end-markets, advancing SWM's goal of diversifying its revenue stream, while maintaining consistency with many attributes of the EP segment. These core attributes include a focus on specialty materials for demanding applications, profitability associated with unique technologies, collaborative customer relationships, leading competitive positions, and operational excellence. 2 AVAILABLE INFORMATION Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), which filings include this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Proxy Statements, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all related amendments, are available, free of charge, on the Investor Relations section of our web site at www.swmintl.com.

We operate and manage two reportable segments based on our product lines: Advanced Materials & Structures and Engineered Papers.  The Advanced Materials & Structures segment manufactures resin-based products used in specialty applications in the filtration, infrastructure and construction, transportation, industrial, and medical end-markets.  This segment is comprised of the five businesses we acquired from 2013 to 2017: DelStar, the Pronamic and SNN acquisitions, Argotec and Conwed, which the Company has integrated into a more holistically aligned operating segment. Our Engineered Papers segment produces both tobacco-related papers and non-tobacco-related papers.  Our tobacco-related papers, which comprise a large majority of EP's sales, include various papers used in cigarette production and reconstituted tobacco (""Recon""), a reprocessed tobacco material. Additional information regarding ""Segment Performance"" is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. In addition, selected financial data for our segments is available in Note 20. Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and a discussion regarding the risks associated with foreign operations is available in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Market Risk.  In conjunction with the change in reportable segments, corresponding information for all prior periods presented has been restated to correspond to the presentation in the current year. Financial information about foreign and domestic operations, contained under the caption ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation"" appearing in Part II, Item 7 herein and in Notes 12, 13, 16 and 20 (""Restructuring and Impairment Activities,"" ""Debt,"" ""Income Taxes"" and ""Segment Information,"" respectively) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in Part II, Item 8 herein, is incorporated by reference in this Item 1. Advanced Materials & Structures Products.  We manufacture and sell a variety of highly engineered resin-based nets, films, and other non-wovens. These specialty materials are often used in growing applications serving the filtration, infrastructure and construction, transportation, industrial, and medical end-markets.  Most of our production technologies are extrusion-based, meaning resin pellets are heated, softened, and forced through a metal die to form continuous sheets or strands. We have significant technological expertise in proprietary die construction, which our competitors often outsource, and we consider this an advantage in protecting our technology and competitive position. However, unlike the EP segment which relies primarily on patent protection for key innovation protection, AMS relies more heavily on trade secrets and manufacturing ""know-how."" Our thermoplastic nets are used in a variety of applications, the most prominent of which is their use as spacer netting in reverse osmosis water filtration (""RO filtration"") devices.  We have established a strong presence in this application by customizing products to meet demanding customer specifications, such as thickness/weight, flow characteristics, and heat and pressure resistance.  Our nets are also used in a variety of other filtration applications such as fuel and hydraulic fluid filters, pharmaceutical filters, and food and beverage filters.  Another key netting application is erosion and sediment control products for the infrastructure and construction end-markets.  Our nets are the outside layers in erosion control blankets, which are used to prevent erosion on sloped terrain.  We also produce high-performance sediment control ""socks"" which are used to set perimeters around various development sites to contain sediment and prevent contamination of water sources.  Our nets can also be found in a variety of industrial applications such as carpet cushion support and retail food packaging. We manufacture our thermoplastic polyurethane films (""TPU"") to have combinations of the following attributes; UV, scratch and water resistance and ultra-clarity.  The ability to demonstrate these rare combinations make them ideally suited for demanding transportation-related surface protection applications, primarily automotive paint protection and security reinforced glass.  These products are also used in certain niche applications such as graphics and laminated textiles in the industrial end-market, and also in the medical end-market.  Other films, including apertured film products, are used in wound care applications, such as finger bandages and wound dressings for the medical end-market and also used in specialty liquid filters for ultra-pure semiconductor manufacturing processes. 4 Our non-wovens are typically air-laid resin-based materials often used in liquid filtration and residential and commercial air filtration.  In addition to rolled goods, SWM also manufactures rigid core tubing, an extruded resin product that also is primarily used in reverse osmosis water filtration devices, and flexible tubing used in various medical and industrial applications. With the growth of our AMS division, our technical expertise around resin-based materials is increasing.  We believe we have industry-leading innovation capabilities and an expanding product portfolio which we expect to support growth through collaborative product development opportunities with our customers. Markets and Customers. The AMS segment supplies customers serving the filtration, infrastructure and construction, transportation, medical, and industrial end-markets.  These products are highly engineered and often customized.  In some cases, we are the sole supplier of certain products to our top customers, though no customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. Generally, the applications and customers the AMS segment serves are in growing end-markets. Within the filtration end-market, reverse osmosis water filtration has exhibited historical long-term growth due to increasing global demand for drinkable water and we expect global infrastructure investments in this area to continue long-term. Our other filtration products are often used in the food and beverage industries and heavy equipment and machinery used in the oil and gas industries, filtering fuel and other hydraulic liquids, as well as serving other functions in the exploration, processing, and transport of oil, gas, and metals.  We refer to non-RO liquid filtration products generally as process filtration.  While sales of process filtration products, particularly those used in the oil, gas, and mining sectors, can be subject to cyclicality and commodity price volatility, we expect strong long-term demand across the product line. Our sales to the infrastructure and construction end-market are largely comprised of erosion/sediment control products.  Our netting is used in the production of erosion control blankets, which are used in highway development projects to cover roadside slopes during and after construction until vegetation has stabilized the ground.  This is a primarily U.S. business, with expected growth supported by continued highway infrastructure investments.  We also offer customers a unique high-performance sediment control solution, a filled ""sock"", used to seal perimeters of development sites which could contain harmful contaminants.  This product has gained adoption in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and also has potential to displace legacy competitive products such as silt fence, which is often used to surround various construction sites to control sediment.  In the construction segment, our netting products are used a support material for carpet cushion, construction materials protection, and support backing for sod production. The majority of our TPU films are used in transportation-related surface protection applications, specifically automotive paint protection.  This product is typically sold and installed in the after-market through dealerships or auto body shops.  Recently, we have benefited from global adoption of paint protection films, particularly in Asia.  Other surface protection applications, such as ballistic-resistant and security glass used primarily on vehicles can be impacted by government and military contracts.  These films are also used in commercial architectural glass.  Our industrial applications are spread across a variety of other industries, such as apparel, food manufacturing, graphics and energy, while our medical film products largely serve the wound care management area of the medical end-market. Sales and Distribution. AMS products are primarily sold by the marketing, sales and customer service organizations of our AMS operations directly to manufacturers, however, in some geographic regions, we use sales agents to assist us in the sales process.  As part of our enterprise transformation and integration efforts related to our recently acquired companies, we re-branded the acquired companies and transitioned our AMS sales operations toward a more unified organization. All acquired companies have been re-branded as SWM and the AMS sales organization will operate and go to market under the SWM trade name, with sales resources deployed by end-market and focused on selling products from across the totality of AMS offerings. We typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. As is typical in the industries in which we operate, ownership of the product generally transfers to our customer upon shipment from our manufacturing facilities, except for certain export sales where ownership typically transfers at the foreign port or customer facility.  In certain instances, we produce and hold or consign products for a limited number of customers for which title does 5 not transfer until shipment from our manufacturing facility or the products are used by the customer.  In these instances, we defer recognition of revenue related to these products until the products are shipped, or the product is used, and ownership of the product transfers to the customer. Competition. Our AMS products are typically leaders in their respective categories and compete against niche products made by competitors such as Marshall Manufacturing Company, Johns Manville, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Shaoxing Naite Plastics Co. Ltd., 3M Company, Covestro AG, Tenax Corporation, Intermas Group, and Hollingsworth and Vose Company.  We believe our AMS products compete primarily on product features, innovations and customer service across the end-markets we serve.  Of the end-markets we serve, industrial is generally the most price competitive due to a higher portion of commodity-type products that we often sell in order to maximize our machine utilization.  As part of our overall strategic focus on high-value specialty products, we have elected to discontinue and/or reduce our efforts to sell some of our lower-margin products allowing us to streamline our capacity and focus on our high value product lines. Raw Materials and Energy.  The primary raw material used in our AMS products is plastic resin, and we rely on a variety of commodity grade and specialty resins, including Polypropylene, Polyurethane, Polyethylene, Polyamide (nylon) and a selection of specialized high temperature engineering grade resins.  Our thermoplastic nets and apertured films are produced using a blend of specialty resins and commodity grade resins like polypropylene.  Resin prices can fluctuate significantly and can impact profitability. Commodity grade resin prices typically correlate with crude oil prices while specialty resin prices often do not. Our TPU films are produced using specialty resins which are significantly more expensive than commodity grade resins.  To partially mitigate the effects of price fluctuations, we have contractual pricing adjustment mechanisms with certain customers. We have multiple sources for most of our resin needs.  However, some of our specialty resins are supplied by fewer manufacturers.  We believe that our purchased raw materials are generally available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to procure needed raw materials from other suppliers.  Our total resin purchases in 2017 and 2016 totaled $129 million and $95 million, respectively.  The increase in 2017 resin purchases is due to Conwed, which is included in our 2017 results. The majority of our energy requirements relate to electricity in the U.S.  We consider this to be a relatively stable energy source. Backlog and Seasonality. In the AMS segment, customer orders are generally manufactured and shipped within 30 days or, in certain instances, within three months. Sales of our products within AMS are generally not subject to large seasonal fluctuations: however, we would expect the second and third quarters to be relatively stronger than the first and fourth quarters. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the AMS segment order backlog was approximately $71 million and $39 million, respectively. The increase in 2017 backlog is primarily due to Conwed, which is included in our 2017 results. Engineered Papers Products.  Our EP segment produces both tobacco-related and non-tobacco-related papers.  Our tobacco-related papers include various papers used in cigarette production and reconstituted tobacco (""Recon""), a reprocessed tobacco material, and comprise a large majority of EP's sales. One of our key cigarette paper products is low ignition propensity (""LIP"") cigarette paper.  LIP cigarettes are designed to self-extinguish when not actively being smoked, thus offering a fire-safety feature.  The U.S., the European Union (""E.U.""), and several other smaller jurisdictions have mandated the use of LIP papers. Our solutions pioneered this cigarette paper category, and we remain a leader in this cigarette paper sub-segment through either direct sales or through licensing agreements.  The Company maintains an extensive and active intellectual property portfolio. Recon is another key component of EP's total sales and profits. The most significant of our Recon products is reconstituted tobacco leaf, ""RTL"" or ""traditional RTL""), which cigarette manufacturers often blend with virgin tobacco to achieve certain attributes in cigarettes, such as taste or reduced delivery of tar, nicotine, or other tobacco-related smoking 6 constituents.  Historically, the production of RTL has often been a cost-effective use for tobacco leaf scraps, though virgin leaf price and inventory supply conditions can shift the relative attractiveness of our products. We also produce a similar line of Recon products referred to as wrappers and binders for use in machine-made cigars.  Recently, a new generation of tobacco industry products generally referred to as Heat not Burn (""HnB"") have been introduced into the marketplace with a goal of reducing harmful components in smoking. We generated commercial sales to one customer in 2017, and this product offers potential growth if global consumer adoption gains momentum and it gains support from appropriate regulatory authorities. Our non-tobacco paper products include a mix of lightweight papers including low-volume, high-value, engineered materials such as alkaline battery separator papers, as well as high-volume commodity paper grades for printing and writing, flooring laminates, and food service packaging, which are intended to maximize machine utilization.  From 2014 through 2017, non-tobacco papers comprised approximately 11% of EP segment net sales.  We intend to make continued diversification investments in our EP segment to broaden our offerings, utilize existing machine capacity, and/or further monetize our paper making and reconstitution technologies. Our wet-laid paper making technologies can be broadly classified into two main production processes: flat-wire production and incline-wire production.  Generally, our machines are flat-wire, meaning a liquid slurry of short pulp fibers and water are laid onto flat-wire conveyor belts, with the water draining through the wire as the fibers (wood, flax, tobacco, etc.) bond together to form a paper sheet.  Incline-wire machines allow for increased drainage, enabling the use of longer fibers which bond into a more open web, increasing the porosity.  Incline wire machines are typically associated with higher-value products given this added porosity, which is important in filtration and other specialty applications that tend to justify premium pricing. The Company continues to focus resources on innovation through activities in our OneFiber lab where paper customers can work closely with our technologists to develop improved paper-based products and our LeafLab fiber reconstitution incubator at our facility in France. Our reconstitution technologies have potential to be utilized in products serving the cosmetics and packaging industries reprocessing botanical, vegetable, or other plant fibers.  Furthermore, SWM's Recon technologists are active in joint development with several cigarette manufacturers to drive continued innovation and product commercialization in the rapidly emerging Heat not Burn reduced-risk tobacco product area. Markets and Customers.  Our EP segment is heavily influenced by global smoking trends, particularly in the U.S., the E.U. (both LIP markets), and Brazil where we have the majority of our operations and highest share of the category's volume.  Historically, mature geographic regions, such as the U.S. and the E.U. have exhibited a steady decline in smoking rates, often to the low-to-mid single digits. We supply the major, and many of the smaller, cigarette and cigar manufacturers.  We sell our products directly to the major tobacco companies or their designated converters in the Americas, Europe, Asia and elsewhere. Philip Morris-USA, a subsidiary of Altria Group Inc., Japan Tobacco Inc. (""JT""), and British American Tobacco (""BAT""), are our three largest customers and, together with their respective affiliates and designated converters, accounted for 31%, 35% and 42% of our 2017, 2016 and 2015 consolidated net sales, respectively.  Although the total loss of one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, we do not believe that such a loss is likely given our significance in the worldwide supply chain of cigarette-related papers. Sales and Distribution. Our internal marketing, sales and customer service organizations sell most of our tobacco-related products directly to cigarette manufacturers or their designated converters.  Most of our EP segment's non-tobacco related products are sold directly to manufacturers.  In some geographic regions, we use sales agents.  We do not sell our products directly to consumers or advertise our products in consumer media.  We typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. As is typical in our industry, ownership of the product generally transfers to our customer upon shipment from our plants, except for certain export sales where ownership typically transfers at the foreign port or customer facility. Competition.  The specialized nature of tobacco-related papers requires unique papermaking equipment, technical expertise, and research and development capabilities to meet exacting customer specifications.  These factors have limited the number of competitors capable of servicing global cigarette manufacturers. 7 As the sole domestic producer of cigarette papers in North America and Latin America (SWM production in Brazil), we believe that we have a significant majority of the category share in those regions.  Our paper plants in France and LIP printing facility in Poland sell a large amount of their products in the E.U.  We estimate that we have a direct share of more than 40% of cigarette paper sales in the E.U., and coupled with royalty payments from a key competitor to whom we have licensed our LIP technology, we believe we are able to monetize over 80% of the LIP-compliant E.U. cigarette market.  Our principal competitors include delfortgroup AG ("" delfort""), which licenses our LIP technology, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. (""Miquel y Costas""), Julius Glatz GmbH and PT Bukit Muria Jaya (""BMJ""). In December 2017, the Dusseldorf Court of Appeals affirmed the German District Court judgment of patent infringement against Glatz including an injunction against making and selling LIP cigarette paper. We believe that the basis of cigarette and our non-tobacco papers competition is price, consistent quality, security of supply, and level of technical service. Outside of China, SWM is the only non-cigarette company that produces RTL through a paper-making process. Some cigarette companies such as Philip Morris-USA, British American Tobacco, JT and STMA (China) produce RTL primarily for their own internal use.  Our customers' cigarette blending decisions, which affect our traditional RTL sales volumes, can be influenced by worldwide virgin tobacco prices and availability as well as the general attractiveness of various competing in-house reconstituted tobacco products.  Huabao International Holdings Ltd, a Hong Kong company, produces reconstituted tobacco in China.  We believe that the basis of competition in this geographic region is primarily quality and price. Similarly, for HnB products, we believe we are the only non-cigarette manufacturer with production capabilities. Raw Materials and Energy. Wood pulp is the primary fiber used in our EP segment. Our operations consumed approximately $42 million and $43 million of wood pulp in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, all of which we purchased. While EP uses other specialty fibers, such as flax, in our operations, we believe that purchased raw materials are generally available from several sources. Paper production uses significant amounts of energy, primarily electricity, natural gas and fuel oil.  We believe that energy supply is generally reliable throughout our manufacturing footprint, although prices can fluctuate significantly based on demand. We enter into agreements to procure a portion of our energy requirements for future periods in order to reduce the uncertainty of future energy costs. We also have a sustainability program focused on reducing our impact on the environment. Additional information regarding agreements for the supply of certain raw materials and energy is included in Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog and Seasonality. While our U.S., Polish and Brazilian EP operations do not calculate or maintain records of order backlogs, we typically receive forecasts of future demands from certain larger customers which are used to manage production and ensure sufficient supply of paper products. Our French paper operations order backlog was approximately $34 million and $28 million on December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Paper orders are typically received and shipped within a 30-day period.  For RTL operations, order backlog was approximately $100 million and $96 million on December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is typically filled within one fiscal year. The EP segment has historically experienced steady order flow.  However, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into the first half of 2016, we benefited from large customer-driven inventory builds of LIP papers in Europe ahead of an approaching regulatory change.  This inventory build reversed in the second half of 2016, creating atypical seasonality in our quarterly financial results in 2016 and 2017.  Generally, sales of our paper and reconstituted tobacco products are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to periodic machine downtime and typically lower order volumes in the fourth quarter. 8 Research and Development As of December 31, 2017 we employ approximately 90 research and development employees in research and laboratory facilities in France, Brazil, Poland, and the U.S. We are dedicated to developing product innovations and improvements to meet the needs of individual customers. We expensed $17.8 million in 2017, $17.5 million in 2016 and $14.0 million in 2015 on research and development. We believe that our research and product development capabilities have played an important role in establishing our reputation for high quality, superior products in both our AMS and EP segments.  Within AMS, we have a history of finding innovative design solutions, including developing products that improve the performance of customers' products and manufacturing operations. We believe that our commitment to research and development, coupled with our investment in new technology and equipment, has positioned us to take advantage of growth opportunities in many places around the world.  Within EP, our research and development has enabled us to establish and sustain leading shares in various cigarette paper products, specifically LIP paper.  We also are working with customers to meet potential future demand for reduced-harm tobacco products. Patents and Trademarks As of December 31, 2017, we owned 64 patents and had 65 pending patent applications in our AMS segment. While we consider our patents, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or group of patents is material to the conduct of our AMS business segment. In our AMS segment, as described in the branding initiative discussed above, SWM made a strategic decision to transition away from certain legacy business trade names associated with our recent acquisitions in favor of a streamlined SWM enterprise branding approach.  Thus, in 2016, the Company recognized an impairment of our DelStar trade name asset as further described in Note 10. Intangible Assets, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Information.  The Company will continue to market its products under the long-standing product-level brand names and trademarks such as ""NALTEX"", ""DELNET"", ""ARGOGUARD"" and ""ARGOTHANE"". As of December 31, 2017, we owned 238 patents and had 115 pending patent applications in our EP segment, covering a variety of cigarette papers, RTL, cigar wrapper and binder and other products and processes in the U.S., Western Europe and several other countries. We believe that our patents, together with our papermaking expertise and technical sales support, have been instrumental in establishing us as the leading worldwide supplier of cigarette papers.  We believe that patents have contributed to our position as the world's leading independent producer of papers used for LIP cigarettes. Management believes that in the EP segment, our ""ALGINEX"" water-based technology trademark, our ""GLUCIGENTM"" trademark for use in banded papers for the production of LIP cigarettes, and the ""SWM"" logo and trade names have been important contributors to the marketing of our products.  Further, we have developed, individually or in conjunction with customers, technologies to address the demand for cigarette paper for LIP cigarettes in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the E.U.  We have licensed to others the right to use certain of our LIP intellectual property, excluding ALGINEX related intellectual properties. Management of a large portion of SWM's research and development activities is provided from our Luxembourg City, Luxembourg operation (""SWM Luxembourg"").  These activities are often performed at other SWM locations under contract by SWM Luxembourg, and funded by SWM Luxembourg.  SWM Luxembourg has the authority to initiate and manage research and development projects in areas such as, but not limited to, LIP paper, reconstituted tobacco for heat-non-burn devices, netting and other extruded resin products, and our non-tobacco products unit (Advanced Fibers and Materials).  This operation also provides global oversight and active management for much of the Company's intellectual property rights. 9 Administrative and Court Proceedings Regarding Papers for Lower Ignition Propensity Cigarettes In January 2015, the Company initiated patent infringement proceedings in Germany against Glatz under multiple LIP-related patents. In December, 2017, the Dusseldorf Appeal Court affirmed the German District Court judgment on infringement of EP 1482815 against Glatz. The cost, timing and outcome of intellectual property litigation can be unpredictable and thus no assurances can be given as to the outcome or impact on us of such litigation. Employees As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 3,600 regular, full-time, active employees. North American Operations.  Hourly employees at the Spotswood, New Jersey, Ancram, New York and Minneapolis, Minnesota plants are represented by locals of the United Steel Workers Union. The two-year collective bargaining agreement with hourly employees at our Spotswood plant is effective through July 28, 2018. The three-year collective bargaining agreement with employees at our Ancram plant is effective through September 30, 2020. The three-year collective bargaining agreement with hourly employees at our Minneapolis facility is effective through October 31, 2018. We believe employee and union relations continue to be positive at the Spotswood, Ancram and Minneapolis operational facilities. Our operations in Canada, South Carolina, Massachusetts, and the former DelStar and Conwed facilities, other than Minneapolis, are non-union. We believe that employee relations are positive. French Operations.  Hourly employees at our Quimperl, Spay, and Saint-Girons, France plants are union represented. We believe that employee relations in France are positive. Luxembourg Operations.  Employees at our Luxembourg office are non-union. We believe that employee relations in Luxembourg are positive. Brazilian Operations.  Hourly employees at the Pirahy, Brazil plant are represented by a union. The one-year collective bargaining agreement with employees at SWM-B is effective through May 31, 2018. We believe that employee relations are generally positive and comparable to those of other similarly situated Brazilian manufacturing operations. Polish Operations.  Employees at our Strykow, Poland facility are non-union. We believe that employee relations in Poland are positive. Chinese Operations.  Employees at our Suzhou, China facility are non-union. We believe that employee relations in China are positive. English Operations.  Some hourly employees at our Gilberdyke, England facility are represented by a union.  We believe that employee relations in England are positive. Belgium Operations.  Employees at our Genk, Belgium facility work in accordance with Belgium labor regulations. We believe that employee relations in Belgium are positive. Environmental Matters Capital expenditures for environmental controls to meet legal requirements and those relating to the protection of the environment at our facilities in the U.S., United Kingdom, France and Brazil were $1.1 million in 2017, no material amount of which was the result of environmental fines or settlements.  We expect such expenditures to be $1.0 million or less in each of the next two years, of which no material amounts are expected to be the result of environmental fines or settlements. These expenditures are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or competitive position; however, these estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans, changes in legal requirements or other factors. 10 Working Capital We normally maintain approximately 50 to 90 days of inventories to support our operations. Our sales terms average between 15 and 60 days for payment by our customers, dependent upon the products and market segment served. With respect to our accounts payable, we typically carry approximately 15 to 40 days outstanding, in accordance with our purchasing terms, which vary by business location. The accounts payable balance varies in relation to changes in our manufacturing operations, particularly due to changes in prices of wood pulp, resins and purchased energy and the level and timing of capital expenditures related to projects in progress.

Risk Factors Factors That May Affect Future Results Many risk factors both within and outside of our control could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and on the market price of our common stock. While not an exhaustive list, the following important risk factors could affect our future results, including our actual results for 2017 and thereafter and could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we have made or may make. We expect our business to continue to be adversely impacted by governmental actions relating to tobacco products, as well as by decreased demand for tobacco products due to declining social acceptance of smoking, new smoking technologies, and litigation in the U.S. and other countries. In 2017, approximately 49% of our net sales were from products used by the tobacco industry in making cigarettes or other tobacco products.  Cigarette consumption outside of Asia has generally declined due to, among other things, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, public reports with respect to the possible harmful effects of smoking, including effects of second-hand smoke, the use of other tobacco products, the development and use of new tobacco-related or substitute products or technologies, such as e-cigarettes, that do not use our products, and, particularly in the U.S., to litigation and actions on the part of private parties to restrict smoking.  For instance, litigation is continuing against major U.S. manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or the effect adverse developments in pending and future litigation may have on the tobacco industry or its demand for our products, but in the past litigation has adversely affected demand for consumer tobacco products.  These factors have led, and could lead, to certain merchants deciding not to sell tobacco products.  As a result, the overall demand for conventional tobacco cigarettes outside of Asia has generally been declining in terms of volume of sales.  These declines have had an adverse effect on demand for our products in these regions.  We expect these trends to accelerate and thus to continue to reduce smoking levels and adversely affect demand for our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In recent years, governmental entities around the world, particularly in the U.S., Brazil, Russia, Australia and Western Europe, have taken, or have proposed, actions that had, or are likely to have, the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products which, in turn, reduces demand for our products.  These actions, including efforts to regulate, restrict or prohibit the sale, advertisement and promotion of tobacco products and their components, to limit smoking in public places, to control or restrict additives that may be used in tobacco products and to increase taxes on such products, are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other tobacco products.  For example, in the U.S., the regulatory jurisdiction of the federal Food and Drug Administration was extended in 2009 to include tobacco products, and again in 2016 to include cigars and additional tobacco products.  These products are now subject to product component disclosure regulations, new controls on ingredients and design changes, and additional restrictions relating to marketing and labeling.  The federal Food and Drug Administration could promulgate additional regulations.  In Brazil, regulations limit the use of additives to cigarettes. In the E.U., the Tobacco Products Directive regulates the content, effects, marketing and labeling of tobacco products, and both revisions to the Directive and the ongoing phase-in of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemical Substances regulation (""REACH"") may further restrict product ingredients.  Additionally, the World Health Organization is actively promoting tobacco regulation, and other countries worldwide are in the process of adopting some or all of these restrictions.  It is not possible to predict the additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products that may be instituted, or additional countries that may adopt such legislation or regulations, or the extent to which such legislation or regulations may impact the design or formulation of our customers' products.  Such legislation or regulation may adversely impact the demand for traditional cigarettes and cigars, with corresponding impacts on our sales of cigarette papers, RTL and associated items, which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 13 Our joint ventures in China serve only the local market.  Declines in Chinese cigarette consumption could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including our CTS and CTM joint ventures it. Our technological advantages are unlikely to continue indefinitely. We consider our intellectual property and patents to be a material asset. We have been at the forefront of developing new products and technology within our industries and have patented several of our innovations, particularly with regard to cigarette paper used to produce LIP cigarettes. This has enhanced our ability to sell products and to provide added functionality and other value to the products we sell allowing them to command higher margins.  This advantage has also enabled us to license certain of our patents and know-how to, and earn royalty income from, third parties.  Presently, we are seeing evidence of increasing efforts and activity by our competitors and some customers to develop and sell competitive products, particularly in the area of papers used for LIP applications and e-cigarettes, with the effect of creating pricing pressure on our LIP products. Over time, we expect our competitors to develop competitive products that are designed to avoid our intellectual property or to license our innovations. Ultimately, our patents will expire (generally before 2023) and some may be held invalid in certain jurisdictions before their expiration dates.  In addition to protecting certain of our technological advantages through patenting, we also protect a significant amount of our technological advantages as trade secrets, especially with regard to our AMS segment and our RTL products.  As we expand our production of LIP papers, RTL and our AMS operations to more locations and countries, the risk of the loss of proprietary trade secrets will increase, and any significant loss would result in the loss of the competitive advantages provided by such trade secrets. While we cannot predict the impact or the timing of these trends and eventualities, they likely will reduce our sales and margins from the levels that we otherwise would have achieved. Furthermore, the extent to which LIP regulations will be adopted in additional regions is uncertain, as is the timing of such adoptions and the technical standards that would be implemented. The absence of such adoptions or the failure to implement standards consistent with those in the U.S. and Western Europe could have an adverse impact on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Effectively policing our domestic and international intellectual property and patent rights is costly and may not be successful. Our portfolio of granted patents varies by country, which could have an impact on any competitive advantage provided by patents in individual countries. We cannot guarantee that any U.S. or foreign patent, issued or pending, will provide us with any continued competitive advantage. We rely on patent, trademark, and other intellectual property laws of the U.S. and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights. However, we cannot guarantee that one or more of our patents will not be challenged by third parties and/or ultimately held invalid by courts or patent agencies of competent jurisdiction, which could remove the legal barriers preventing competitors from practicing our LIP technology among others. Further, there can be no assurances that we will be able, or that it will be economic for us, to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property or infringing our patents without our authorization, which may reduce any competitive advantage we have developed. In the event that we need to enforce certain of our patents against infringement through judicial or administrative actions, the litigation to protect these rights is often costly and time consuming and diverts management resources; moreover, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property will be successful, or that a defendant will not assert counterclaims against us or challenges to other intellectual property we may own. Some of our patents have been the subject of opposition hearings. Like the actions we undertake to enforce our IP rights, oppositions filed against us in respect of our intellectual property are expensive and divert management time and resources. 14 Even when the Company is initially successful, there can be no assurance that the counterparty will not appeal, or that the appeal will not be successful. Even when successful at the appeal level, as with respect to patents such as EP 1,482,815 (relating to a low-viscosity polymers to print LIP bands), there can be no assurance that a patent will not be later successfully challenged in individual national court jurisdictions. We do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties. However, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our products or services or a court or other governmental body may come to a different conclusion from ours. In that event, we may be subject to significant claims for damages or disruptions to our operations. Because of the geographic diversity of our business, we are subject to a range of international risks. Our operations are located in many countries around the world and operate, to a degree, in a decentralized manner.  There are inherent control and fraud risks in such a structure.  Moreover, we have manufacturing facilities in eight countries and two joint ventures in China and sell products in over 90 countries, many of which are emerging and undeveloped markets. As a result, our manufacturing operations, sales and results, depending on their location, are subject to various international business risks, including, but not limited to, the following:  Foreign countries can impose significant import, export, excise and income tax and other regulatory restrictions on our business, including limitations on repatriation of profits and proceeds of liquidated assets. While we attempt to manage our operations and international movements of cash from and amongst our foreign subsidiaries in a tax-efficient manner, unanticipated international movement of funds due to unexpected changes in our business or changes in tax and associated regulatory schemes could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We are exposed to global as well as regional macroeconomic and microeconomic factors, which can affect demand and pricing for our products, including: unsettled political and economic conditions, including as they relate to Brazil, Russia and the Ukraine; expropriation; import and export tariffs; regulatory controls and restrictions; and inflationary and deflationary economies.  These factors together with risks inherent in international operations, including risks associated with any non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the 2013 Brazilian Clean Companies Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the 2013 Russian Law on Preventing Corruption and other non-U.S. anti-bribery law compliance, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We participate in two joint ventures and have one manufacturing facility in China.  The joint ventures sell our products primarily to Chinese tobacco companies. Operations in China entail a number of risks including international and domestic political risks, the need to obtain operating and other permits from the government, adverse changes in the policies or in our relations with government-owned or run customers and the uncertainty inherent in operating within an evolving legal and economic system.  There are also risks inherent with 50% joint ventures, such as a lack of ability to control, and visibility with respect to operations, customer relations and compliance practice, among others.  Changes or increases in international trade sanctions or quotas may restrict or prohibit us from transacting business with established customers or securing new ones, including as to Russia and the Ukraine, which are areas where the Company has offices and/or significant customers and as to which the applicable sanctions have changed unexpectedly on a number of occasions since 2014. Changes in the laws and regulations described above, adverse interpretations or applications of such laws and regulations, and the outcome of various court and regulatory proceedings, including in Europe and Brazil, could adversely impact the Company's business in a variety of ways, including increasing expenses, increasing liabilities, decreasing sales, limiting its ability to repatriate funds and generally limiting its ability to conduct business, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 15 We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws, as well as other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA, the 2013 Brazilian Clean Companies Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the 2013 Russian Law on Preventing Corruption and these other laws generally prohibit us, our employees, consultants and agents from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in joint ventures and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations, or collectively, Trade Control laws. However, there is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A significant portion of our revenues are generated from operations outside the U.S.  In addition, we maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products outside the U.S.  The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally the local currency in which each subsidiary operates.  In particular, a large portion of our commercial business is denominated in euros.  Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars.  Therefore, we must translate revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities from functional currencies into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during, or at the end of, the reporting period.  As a result, our future revenues, costs, results of operations and earnings could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In addition, some of our sale and purchase transactions are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of our operations.  As a result, changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which the transaction is denominated versus the local currency of our operation into which the transaction is being recorded can impact the amount of local currency recorded for such transaction.  This can result in more or less local currency revenue or cost related to such transaction and thus have an effect on our operating profit.  Our Brazilian and Polish operations are more fully exposed to currency transaction risk, especially as a result of U.S. dollar sales in Brazil and euro denominated sales in Poland. We also hold a significant amount of our cash balances in euros, thus any weakening of the euro versus the U.S. Dollar would reduce the amount of U.S. Dollars for which such balances could be exchanged. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also impact the amount reported in other income (expense), net.  For instance, when a non-local currency receivable or payable is not settled in the period in which it is incurred, we are required to record a gain or loss, as applicable, to reflect the impact of any change in the exchange rate as of the end 16 of the period.  We also have to reflect the translation rate impact on the carrying value of our foreign assets and liabilities as of the end of each period, which is recorded as Unrealized Translation Adjustment in Other Comprehensive Income. We utilize a variety of practices to manage this risk, including operating and financing activities and, where considered appropriate, derivative instruments.  All derivative instruments we use are either exchange traded or entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties.  Counterparty risk cannot be eliminated and there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.  We generally hedge foreign currency transaction risk primarily through the use of derivative instruments, including forward and swap contracts and, to a lesser extent, option contracts.  The use of derivative instruments is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility.  If our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and/or we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the recently passed U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The newly enacted Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, and as such, the U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations.  Currently, the application of accounting guidance is widely uncertain.  Further, compliance with the Tax Act and the accounting for the newly enacted provisions requires accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced by us. As a result, we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Act in our financial statements.  As additional regulatory guidance is issued, as accounting treatments are clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the Code and the application of the law to our operations, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S., or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. The Company's future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or future changes in tax laws or their interpretations as to the legality of tax advantages granted under various current and past corporate structures. Although none of the Company's international tax arrangements are currently being challenged or threatened to be challenged, recent developments, such as the European Commission's investigations on illegal state aid as well as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development project on base erosion and profit shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles or new challenges to our cross-border arrangements, which could materially affect our effective tax rate or require a restructuring of the holding of foreign subsidiaries. If the Company's effective tax rates were to increase, or if any ultimate determination of the Company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company's operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We face competition from several established competitors and, in our RTL business from tobacco leaf; we have limited market transparency. Our four largest competitors for our EP business are delfortgroup AG (""Delfort""), Julius Glatz GmbH (""Glatz""), Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. (""Miquel y Costas"") and PT BUKIT Muria Jaya (""BMJ""). All four primarily operate from modern and cost-effective plants in Western Europe and Asia and are capable and long-standing suppliers to the tobacco industry. Further, three such competitors, Delfort, Glatz and BMJ, are privately held and the third, Miquel y Costas, is a closely held public company. Thus, their financial results and other business developments and strategies are not disclosed to the same extent as ours, which provides them some advantage in dealing with customers. Given the concentration of most of our competitors in Western Europe, which has seen declining demand for tobacco products 17 and has labor laws that make reducing capacity expensive and slow, excess capacity exists and therefore price competition is acute. We believe that all four competitors have good relationships with the multinational cigarette companies, as does the Company. The multinational cigarette companies have been known to use these close relationships to encourage the development of enhanced competition through supporting competitive products and facilities, especially when confronted with new, high-value technologies such as porous plug wrap in the past and LIP today.  We believe our Engineered Paper products compete primarily on product features, price, innovations and customer service.  Due to many of the factors described above, we have a limited ability to predict trends in the industry and there may be a time lag before we become aware of developing trends in the industry. Our AMS segment products compete to some degree against niche products made by Marshall Manufacturing Company, Johns Manville, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Shaoxing Naite Plastics Co. Ltd., 3M Company, Covestro AG, Tenax Corporation, Intermas Group, and Hollingsworth and Vose Company.  We believe our AMS products compete primarily on product features, innovations and customer service.  Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have more resources, thus the actions of these competitors could have an impact on the results of our AMS segment operations. As a result of the foregoing, the Company faces significant selling price, sales volume and new product risks from its competitors, especially during periods (often annually) in which the Company's contracts with its major customers are subject to renewal or renegotiation. Currently, fine papers used to produce cigarettes are only exported on a limited basis from available capacity in China and other Asian locations to western multinational cigarette companies due to government taxes and tariffs, which limit price competitiveness, as well as due to customer preferences. Should conditions change in this regard, capacity that currently is operating in China and elsewhere in Asia would present a risk to our competitive position outside Asia and place further pressure on our legacy paper production platforms.  Similarly, we are starting to see increased competition for some of our AMS products from companies in China, which, we believe, may have lower operating costs than us, resulting in a potential price advantage for such companies. In the RTL end-market segment, demand is a function, among other things, of smoke delivery regulations, the cigarette manufacturer's desire for a uniform and consistent product, the taste profile sought by cigarette manufacturers and the cost of recycling the tobacco by-product scraps relative to the cost of virgin tobacco products.  Thus, our RTL business is also subject to competitive risk from lower cost virgin tobacco leaf or other, cheaper, cigarette fillers.  These factors have resulted, and are likely to continue to result, in materially lower sales volumes for our RTL business, resulting in downtime of certain production machines and, in some cases, accelerated depreciation or impairment charges for certain equipment as well as employee severance expenses associated with downsizing or restructuring activities. Further, as a result of excess capacity in the tobacco-related papers industry and increased operating costs, competitive levels of selling prices for certain of the Company's products are not sufficient to cover those costs with a margin that the Company considers reasonable.  Such competitive pressures have resulted, and could result in the future, in downtime of certain paper production machines and, in some cases, accelerated depreciation or impairment charges for certain equipment as well as employee severance expenses associated with downsizing or restructuring activities. We are dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales; the loss of one or more of these customers, or changes in their cigarette blending approaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Three customers, together with their respective affiliates and designated converters, accounted for over 31% of our net sales in 2017. The loss of one or more of these customers, or a significant reduction in their purchases, particularly those that impact our sales of LIP papers or reconstituted tobacco, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The enhanced capabilities provided by RTL in the area of product design and regulatory compliance are important to our customers. However, future RTL results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in customer inventories, changes in the cigarette tobacco blending approaches by our customers, changes in regulations and tariffs and the price of virgin tobacco leaf. 18 In addition, significant consolidation has occurred among our tobacco customers, thereby increasing our dependence upon a fewer number of tobacco industry customers and increasing the negotiating leverage of those customers that remain.  If any of our customers were to change suppliers, in-source production of reconstituted tobacco or cigarette papers (including those used to produce LIP cigarettes), institute significant cost-cutting measures or experience financial difficulty, then these customers may substantially reduce their purchases from us, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, adverse results in the negotiation of any of our significant customer contracts, the terms of which are typically negotiated every one to three years, could significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are dependent upon the availability of credit, and changes in interest rates can impact our business. We supplement operating cash flow with bank borrowings under a secured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. Borrowings under this agreement will mature in October 2020 and October 2022. To date, we have been able to access credit when needed and on commercially reasonable terms.  However, deterioration of credit markets, including an economic crisis in the U.S. or elsewhere, whether or not caused by the U.S. or European debt ceiling, deficits and budget issues, could have an adverse impact on our ability to negotiate new credit facilities or access or renew our existing one.  Constraints on the availability of credit, or the unavailability of credit at reasonable interest rates, would negatively impact our business, including potentially impairing our ability to declare dividends, conduct share buy-backs and make acquisitions. Our secured credit facility contains certain financial covenants.  In the event of material unforeseen events that impact our financial performance, particularly during a time when we have material amounts of debt, a situation could arise where we are unable to fully draw from our existing credit facility notwithstanding that there is otherwise available capacity. Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries.  In the event of a default on these agreements, substantially all of the assets of the Company could be subject to foreclosure or liquidation by the secured creditors. We may utilize a combination of variable and fixed-rate debt consisting of short-term and long-term instruments.  We selectively hedge our exposure to interest rate increases on our variable rate long-term debt when we believe that it is practical to do so.  We have utilized various forms of interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap agreements, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps.  There are inherent risks associated with interest rate hedges, including those associated with the movement of interest rates, counterparty risk and unexpected need to refinance debt, thus there can be no certainty that our hedging activities will be successful or fully protect us from interest rate exposure. As of December 31, 2017 the Company has entered into interest rate hedge transactions which have the effect of fixing the interest rate on approximately 54% of our debt subject to variable interest rates. Our use of interest rate hedge agreements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including the risk that a counterparty to a hedge agreement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of interest rate hedge agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. 19 Our internal and external expansion plans and asset dispositions entail different and additional risks relative to the rest of our business. From time to time, we consider acquisitions either within the tobacco industry or outside the industry in connection with our diversification initiatives, such as our acquisitions of DelStar Technologies, Inc., Argotec LLC and Conwed Plastics LLC.  This acquisition activity could involve confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement.  It is possible that an acquisition could adversely impact our results, credit ratings or the outlook of our business, due to, among other things, integration and employee retention challenges, contrasting company cultures and different information technology and reporting systems.  Also, acquisition opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve strategic objectives, smooth integrations or anticipated synergies or returns.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, that we will realize the anticipated benefits or profits through acquisitions or that acquisitions will be accretive to our earnings.  Changes in our portfolio of businesses, assets and products, whether through acquisition (such as our acquisitions of DelStar, Argotec and Conwed), disposition or internal growth, present additional risks, including causing us to incur unknown or new types of liabilities, subjecting us to new regulatory frameworks and new market risks, and acquiring operations in new geographic regions with challenging labor, regulatory and tax regimes.  The potential future expansion of our AMS business unit or other operations could cause these operations to face additional competition from larger and more established competitors than is currently the case. Our ability to dispose of idled assets and the value that may be obtained relative to their book value can result in significant impairment charges. Building a new plant or other facility or relocating, rebuilding or otherwise modifying existing production machinery is a major undertaking and entails a number of risks, including the possibility that the contractors and sub-contractors who are expected to build the facility or rebuild the machine and supply the necessary equipment do not perform as expected, the possibility of cost overruns and delays, or that design defects or omissions cause the facility or machine to perform at less than projected efficiency or at less than projected capacity.  In addition, commencement of production at a new site or at a rebuilt or relocated machine is time consuming and requires testing and acceptance by customers and potentially by regulators, of the facility and the products that are produced.  Also, while we anticipate sufficient demand for the facility's or machine's output, there can be no assurances that the expected demand will materialize.  For more information on our expansion plans, see Part II, Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation"" of this report. We also expect to continue to expend resources to diversify and expand our product portfolio.  Research and development and product diversification have inherent risks, including technical success, market acceptance, new regulations and potential liabilities.  We cannot guarantee that such efforts will succeed, that we will not incur new or different liabilities or that we will achieve a satisfactory return on such expenditures. We may not successfully integrate acquisitions or integrate other SWM operations into AMS and we may be unable to achieve anticipated cost savings or other synergies. The integration of the operations of acquired companies involves a number of risks and presents financial, managerial, reporting, legal and operational challenges.  We may have difficulty, and may incur unanticipated expenses related to, integrating information systems, financial reporting activities, employee retention and integrating and retaining management and personnel from acquired companies.  Among these risks are potential loss of consumer awareness and demand for the acquired companies' products based on the rebranding of those products under the Company's legacy brand names.  Additionally with respect to the acquisitions of DelStar, the two associated acquisitions in December 2014, Argotec, and Conwed in early 2017, we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or commercial or growth synergies, for a number of reasons, including contractual constraints and obligations or an inability to take advantage of expected commercial opportunities, inability to achieve increased operating efficiencies or commercial expansion of key technologies.  In the second half of 2015, we formed our AMS business unit comprised of these operations and certain other SWM resources.  The future success of AMS depends, in part, on our ability to attract additional management, retain key employees, integrate new personnel, operating and reporting systems as well as execute AMS' growth strategy.  Failure to successfully integrate acquired companies into AMS may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 20 Our restructuring activities are time-consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business. We have initiated significant restructuring activities in recent years, including restructurings in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 in France and the U.S., during 2014 in Brazil and during 2012 in the Philippines, that have become part of an overall effort to improve an imbalance between demand for our products and our production capacity as well as improve our profitability and the quality of our products.  We expect to continue these restructuring efforts from time to time.  Restructuring of our existing operations, or as a result of acquisitions, involves issues that are complex, time-consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business as well as garner review from regulatory authorities which could result in financial impacts to the Company.  The challenges involved in executing the actions that are part of our ongoing and, potentially future, restructuring plans include:  demonstrating to customers that the restructuring activities will not result in adverse changes in service standards or business focus;  consolidating administrative infrastructure and manufacturing operations while maintaining adequate controls throughout the execution of the restructuring;  preserving distribution, sales and other important relationships and resolving potential conflicts that may arise;  estimating, managing and minimizing the cost of the restructuring activities;  minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities;  maintaining employee morale, retaining key employees, maintaining reasonable collective bargaining agreements and avoiding strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest while implementing restructuring programs that often include reductions in the workforce;  securing government approval of such plans, where necessary, and managing the litigation and associated liabilities that often are associated with restructuring actions;  incurring costs associated with delays in restructuring activities caused by labor negotiations and/or governmental approvals;  coordinating and combining operations, which may be subject to additional constraints imposed by collective bargaining agreements and local laws and regulations; and  achieving the anticipated levels of net cost savings and efficiency as a result of the restructuring activities. If we do not achieve future and continued expected benefits as a result of our legal entity realignment, the ability to achieve our financial guidance for operating results and our financial condition, results of operations and cash-flow could be adversely affected. In 2014, 2016 and again in 2017, we re-examined and re-aligned certain internal business operations and our legal entity structure in order to improve our cash-flows, have easier access to our foreign cash, centralize, enhance the management of our intellectual property and streamline certain internal business activities.  Steps to accomplish these objectives have been taken and additional steps may be taken later as we continue to grow certain of our operations, diversify our business and continue our business analyses.  We anticipate that there could be further realignment activities in the future. Realignments can present significant potential risks of events occurring that could delay, halt or adversely affect the success of a project, including delays encountered in finalizing the scope of, and implementing, the realignment, the failure to achieve targeted benefits or savings, the failure to follow appropriate regulatory requirements or internal processes and procedures and a potential decrease in employee morale.  Further, there can be no assurance that the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or to which we are otherwise deemed to have sufficient tax 21 activity, will not challenge our interpretation of tax laws and regulations or the tax benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the realignment.  Any such challenges (including our response thereto) can be time consuming or expensive with potentially uncertain outcomes, including as to additional interest, penalties or increase in back taxes that could be payable by us.  In addition, changes to U.S. or non-U.S. tax laws and regulations may materially impact the anticipated benefits of our legal entity structure and any potential future realignments.  Any future impact to our effective tax rate will also depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with the regulatory requirements for such a realignment including applicable taxing provisions and realization of our anticipated profits as well as the countries in which such profits are realized.  Further, we have incurred certain costs in connection with the realignment and we may incur additional costs, including ones that are not currently expected to be incurred. There also can be significant costs and complexities around meeting the necessary tax accounting rules as required by our realignment structure and regulations applicable to us and it is possible that the authorities might disagree with our accounting treatment or that there may be a disagreement or dispute regarding our calculations.   It is also possible that the authorities might change, either prospectively or retrospectively, certain complex tax rulings that would have potentially significant impacts to our financial results.  Additionally, due to the complex nature of some of the accounting and taxation calculations, the Company may incur significant costs in defending its interpretation of positions in regards to certain tax legislation, rulings and inquiries. To the extent these risks or circumstances occur, we may fail to achieve the future financial and business benefits that we anticipate as a result of the realignments, our tax rate may increase and our future operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted.  Thus, there can also be no assurance that we will realize the expected future benefits of the realignments. Our financial performance can be significantly impacted by the cost and availability of raw materials and energy and we may have limited ability to pass through increases in costs to our customers. Raw materials are a significant component of the cost of the products that we manufacture.  The cost of wood pulp, which is the largest component of the raw materials that we use in our EP segment, and some resins used by our AMS segment are highly cyclical and can be more volatile than general consumer or producer inflationary changes in the general economy. For instance, during the period from January 2013 through December 2017, the U.S. list price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp (""NBSK"") a representative pulp grade that we purchase, increased by 35%. Also, in that same time period, the cost of polypropylene has fluctuated significantly based on a number of factors, including changes in global oil markets.  As we periodically enter into agreements with customers under which we agree to supply products at fixed prices, unanticipated increases in the costs of raw materials, or the lack of availability of such raw materials (due to force majeure or other reasons), can significantly impact our financial performance.  Even where we do not have fixed-price agreements, we generally cannot pass through increases in raw material costs in a timely manner and in many instances are not able to pass through the entire increase to our customers.  Further, some of the resins we use in our AMS segment are only available from a single supplier, or a limited number of suppliers.  Consequently, such supplier(s) can control the availability and thus the cost of the resins we use, notwithstanding any changes in the cost of oil.  It can be time consuming and costly, and occasionally impractical, to find replacement resins where such suppliers limit the availability or increase the cost of resins we use. Paper manufacturing is energy-intensive.  In France, Poland, China and in the U.S., availability of energy generally is reliable, although prices can fluctuate significantly based on variations in overall demand.  Western Europe is becoming significantly dependent on energy supplies from the Commonwealth of Independent States, which in the past has demonstrated a willingness to restrict or cut off supplies of energy to certain customers.  The volume of oil or gas flowing through pipeline systems that ultimately connect to Western Europe also has been cut off or restricted in the past, and such actions can adversely impact the supply of energy to Western Europe and, consequently, the cost and availability of electricity to our European operations.  In Brazil, because production of electricity is heavily reliant upon hydroelectric plants, availability of electricity can be, and has been in the past, affected by rain variations.  Electricity in Brazil is also heavily taxed.  Due to the competitive pricing for most of our products, we typically are unable to fully pass through higher energy costs to our customers. Periodically, when we believe it is advantageous to do so, we enter into agreements to procure a portion of our energy for future periods in order to reduce the uncertainty of future energy costs.  However, in recent years this has only marginally slowed the increase in energy costs due to the volatile changes in energy prices we have experienced. 22 A failure of, or a security breach in, a key information technology system or process or other unusual events could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business; IT project delays and overruns are possible. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees.  The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy and we rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business.  Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or be breached due to employee or third party error, malfeasance or other disruptions.  Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.  Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, including penalties under EU privacy laws, and disrupt our operations.  There are further risks associated with the information systems of companies we acquire, both in terms of systems compatibility, level of security and functionality.  It may cost us significant money and resources to address these risks and we may fail to address them successfully, adversely impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, we undertake significant information technology systems projects, including enterprise resource planning updates, modifications and roll-outs.  These projects are subject to cost overruns and delays.  Not only could these cost overruns and delays impact our financial statements but a delay in the completion of a needed IT project could adversely impact our ability to run our business and make fully informed decisions. We rely on a limited number of key employees, have had significant personnel turnover and have had difficulty in attracting and hiring qualified new personnel in some areas of our business. The loss of any of our key employees, including our CEO and his direct reports, due to retirement, difference in culture with acquired businesses, the demands of our business, our tobacco-related operations or otherwise could adversely affect our business and thus our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Because a large part of our business is tied to the tobacco industry, we may also experience difficulty in retaining and hiring qualified executives and other personnel in our AMS segment, at corporate and/or in EP.  This may be caused by the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry.  We not only compete for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater social acceptance but also with larger, more established companies within the tobacco industry. As we diversify through acquisitions outside our tobacco-related operations, we run the risk of turnover of key personnel within the businesses we acquire as well as difficulty in finding and attracting first class talent in industry segments that are new to us.  This could slow the growth of these businesses and impede our ability to find and complete synergistic acquisitions. Our business is subject to seasonal or cyclical market and industry fluctuations which may result in reduced net sales and operating profits during certain periods. Sales of our EP products in the U.S., Europe, China and Brazil are subject to seasonal fluctuations.  In the U.S. and Europe, customer shutdowns typically occur in August and December and historically have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months.  Likewise, the production of cigarettes in China for the Chinese market slows significantly before and during Chinese New Year, with a corresponding reduction in demand for our EP products. Additionally, our facilities occasionally shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months or as a result of slow demand, resulting in higher product costs, higher maintenance expenses and reduced operating profit.  In Brazil, customer orders are typically lower in December due to a holiday season during much of January and February.  The oil & gas, mining and automotive industries are important to sales in our AMS segment and these and other industries tend to be cyclical, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the duration of their down cycles. 23 Our business depends upon good relations with our employees; work stoppages, slowdowns or legal action by our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We employ approximately 3,600 employees, including manufacturing employees represented by unions.  Although we believe that employee and union relations are generally positive, there is no assurance that this will continue in the future.  We may experience difficulties in maintaining appropriate relations with unions and employees in certain locations.  Problems or changes affecting employees in certain locations may affect relations with our employees at other locations.  The risk of labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production could adversely affect us, especially in conjunction with potential restructuring activities.  If we cannot successfully negotiate or renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, or if negotiations take an excessive amount of time, there may be a heightened risk of work stoppages and we may be unable to achieve planned operational efficiencies.  Work stoppages may be caused by the inability of national unions and the governments of countries in which we operate from reaching agreement, and are outside of our control.  Any work stoppage or failure to reach agreements with our unions could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations, our productivity, the profitability of a manufacturing facility, our ability to develop new products and on our operations as a whole, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business is subject to various environmental laws, regulations and related litigation that could impose substantial costs or other liabilities on us. Our facilities are subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws with respect to air, water and emissions as well as the disposal of solid waste.  We believe that we are operating in substantial compliance with these laws and regularly incur capital and operating expenditures in order to achieve future compliance.  However, these laws may change, which could require changes in our practices, additional capital expenditures or loss of carbon credits, and we may discover aspects of our business that are not in compliance.  Violation of these laws can result in the imposition of significant fines and remediation costs.  In France, we presently have sufficient authorized capacity for our emissions of carbon dioxide.  However, this authorization must be renewed every five years and was last renewed in 2013.  We cannot predict whether we will have sufficient authorized capacity to conduct our operations in France as presently conducted or to do so without having to make substantial capital expenditures in future years. We are a member of a potentially responsible party group (""Global PRP Group"") that entered into a settlement with the State of New Jersey in 1993 concerning the remediation of a landfill site in Middlesex County, New Jersey.  The landfill remediation has been completed.  We have established a reserve of approximately $0.4 million that we believe is adequate to cover our ongoing liability, but we remain exposed to post-closure operating costs over an extended period of years that cannot be fully known or estimated at this time. Although we are not aware of any environmental conditions at any of our facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we own facilities in France, the U.S. and elsewhere that have been operated over the course of many decades.  We may face higher disposal and clean-up costs to replace equipment or facilities containing materials that were compliant when installed, but are now considered contaminants.  Additionally, as we sell closed or other facilities, we may be required to perform additional environmental evaluations that could identify items that might require remediation or other action, the nature, extent and cost of which are not presently known.  We may also incur environmental liabilities in connection with assets or businesses we may purchase in the future. Increases in costs of pension benefits may reduce our profitability. Our results of operations may be negatively affected by expenses we record for our defined benefit pension plans.  Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., (""GAAP""), require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations.  These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets, longevity of our current and former employees and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators and mortality tables.  We are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result 24 in increased funding obligations or negative changes in our stockholder equity.  At the end of 2017, the combined projected benefit obligation of our U.S. and French pension and other postretirement healthcare plans was underfunded by $24.1 million.  For a discussion regarding our pension obligations, see Note 17. Postretirement and Other Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and ""Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources"" in Part II, Item 7.  Although expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") for U.S. plans.  Failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors, which could include a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility, could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans. We are subject to various legal actions and other claims. We regularly are involved in legal actions and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business and otherwise.  We are also subject to many laws and regulations around the world.  Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with every such law or regulation.  Because of the complexity of Brazilian tax laws and court systems, legal actions are a particular risk that affects our Brazilian operations.  Although we believe that our positions in pending disputes about state and federal taxes are correct and will ultimately be upheld by Brazilian courts, the outcome of legal proceedings is difficult to predict.  An adverse result in one or more of these tax disputes could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We are also subject to other litigation in Brazil, including labor and workplace safety claims.  Although we do not believe that any of the currently pending actions or claims against us will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we cannot provide any assurances in this regard.  Information concerning some of these actions that currently are pending is contained in Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this report.  We also cannot give any assurances as to any litigation that might be filed against us in the future, including any claims relating to the alleged harmful effect of tobacco use on human health. Significant impairment charges could result from our evaluation of the Philippines RTL manufacturing site. We suspended construction of our Philippines RTL manufacturing site during 2011.  During 2015, as a result of management's intent and ability to dispose of these assets, the amounts were reclassified from property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale in our balance sheet.  The carrying value of these assets is based on estimated fair value less cost to sell.  During 2017, we compared the estimated fair value less cost to sell to the net book value of the assets which resulted in our recording of an impairment charge of $4.0 million. In years prior to 2015, the carrying value of the assets was evaluated for impairment at each reporting period by assessing the recoverability of the costs based on the undiscounted cash flows of the operation, the likelihood of its reactivation and any alternative uses for the equipment.  This evaluation, along with declines in our RTL volumes, resulted in 2013 in an impairment of $37.2 million.  Further declines in the estimated fair value of these assets could result in a decision to record a further impairment of some or a substantial portion of the remaining outstanding balance of these assets, which was $12.8 million at December 31, 2017. One portion of our business is dependent upon a single plant; further, we have limited cross redundancy across our facilities. Sales of reconstituted tobacco leaf products represent a substantial portion of our revenues and profits.  We presently produce reconstituted tobacco leaf at only one facility located in France and wrapper and binder products at only one facility located in Ancram, New York.  In our AMS business, in order to enhance the protection of our trade secrets, critical proprietary dies used in a significant portion of our extruding operations are made at only one facility with very limited personnel trained to manufacture them.  Further, in order to achieve operational efficiencies, among other reasons, we have limited ability to shift production across our various facilities, thus the loss of production at one facility may not be able to be mitigated by increased production at another.  Consequently, natural disasters, pandemics and other unusual events could cause the loss of, or interruption of operations for a significant length of time at one or 25 more of our facilities in six different countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Fluctuations in construction and infrastructure spending can impact demand for certain of our products. Demand for certain of our products depends on spending in the construction industry, both residential and non-residential, as well as infrastructure sectors.  Spending in those sectors is impacted by numerous circumstances beyond our control including, but not limited to, interest rates, availability of financing, housing inventory, capital spending, corporate investment, local, federal and state regulations, as well as availability and commitment of public funds for municipal spending, capacity utilization and general economic conditions.  Decreased spending in any of these sectors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows during the duration of their down cycle. Historically, we have experienced significant cost savings and productivity benefits relating to our ongoing Operational Excellence program; however, these benefits may not continue indefinitely or at the same levels. Historically, we have experienced significant cost savings and productivity benefits relating to our ongoing Operational Excellence program as it relates to our tobacco operations that have supported our margins during periods of significant attrition in the tobacco industry.  We expect to continue to achieve significant savings and benefits from this program; however, in light of continued industry attrition, execution risks and other factors, we may be unable to continue in the future to obtain savings and benefits in line with historical achievements, and our profitability and financial results could be adversely affected. Similarly, though we have initiated implementation of this program in our AMS business operations in order to achieve margin improvements, due to the different company cultures of the acquisitions that make up a significant part of AMS and our continuing integration of these acquisitions, we may not be able to achieve the desired margin improvements through our Operational Excellence program at AMS.","Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the selected financial data included in Part II, Item 6, ""Selected Financial Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes various forward-looking statements about our markets, the demand for our products and our future prospects. These statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable.  For information about risks and exposures relating to us and our business, you should read the sections entitled ""Factors That May Affect Future Results,"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K  and ""Forward Looking Statements"" at the end of this Item 7. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to ""SWM"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"", ""our"", or similar terms include Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with an understanding of our recent performance, our financial condition and our prospects. The following will be discussed and analyzed:      Summary      Recent Developments      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      Results of Operations      Liquidity and Capital Resources      Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources  Contractual Obligations  Outlook      Forward-Looking Statements Summary In 2017, SWM reported net income of $34.5 million on total net sales of $982.1 million.  Compared to the prior year, net sales increased $142.2 million due primarily to incremental net sales generated from the operations of our newly acquired Conwed business, an increase in organic AMS sales and favorable net foreign currency impacts. These factors were partially offset by lower sales of traditional RTL products in the EP segment. Net income decreased to $34.5 million in 2017 compared to $82.8 million in 2016 resulting primarily from the unfavorable impact of lower sales and associated gross profits in our EP segment, higher intangible asset amortization in our AMS segment and higher interest expense as a result of the Conwed acquisition, and a higher income tax provision primarily related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") on December 22, 2017. These factors were partially offset by the incremental operating profits from the Conwed acquisition and the benefit of higher organic sales and associated gross profits in our AMS segment. Cash provided by operations was $131.0 million in 2017 compared to $129.7 million in 2016. Uses of cash during 2017 included $291.7 million for the acquisition of Conwed, $51.9 million in cash dividends paid to SWM stockholders and $37.2 million of capital spending. Recent Developments On January 20, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Conwed Plastics LLC.  The purchase price was $295 million in cash plus three potential earn-out payments not to exceed $40 million in the aggregate, which payments are contingent upon the achievement of certain financial metrics in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021.  Conwed is a leading producer of resin-based netting solutions with proprietary manufacturing processes and innovative technologies and production facilities in the U.S. and Belgium.  Conwed has been incorporated into our AMS segment and is expected to generate significant synergies with our existing AMS operations. 36 On November 1, 2017, we announced an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.43 per share. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We disclose those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the first note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported and disclosure of contingencies. Changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the estimates and judgments made for each of the following items and our accounting for and presentation of these items in the accompanying financial statements: Accounting for Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss). The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.  Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 740, Income Taxes (""ASC 740""), states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.  We (1) record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and (2) adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, which include, but are not limited to, a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be incomplete due to 37 the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue and the related accounts receivable when the following four criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) ownership has transferred to the customer; (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured based on the Company's judgment regarding the collectability of its accounts receivable. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue when it ships its manufactured product and title and risk of loss passes to its customer in accordance with the terms of sale of the product. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board, shipping point, or equivalent. For sales transactions designated free on board, destination, or equivalent, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site, at which time title and risk of loss are transferred. Provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue is recorded. Deferred revenue represents advance payments from customers which are earned based upon a mutually agreed-upon amount per unit of future product sales. Accounting for Contingencies We accrue an estimated loss by taking a charge to income when the likelihood that a future event, such as a legal proceeding, will result in a loss or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and our cash flows. For further information, please see ""Litigation"" in Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" and Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Property, Plant and Equipment Valuation Our manufacturing processes are capital intensive; as a result, we make substantial investments in property, plant and equipment which are recorded at cost. Net property, plant and equipment comprised 23% of our total assets as of December 31, 2017. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Production machines and related equipment are not subject to substantial technological changes rendering them obsolete and are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of 10 to 20 years. When indications of impairment exist, we assess the likelihood of recovering the cost of long-lived assets based on our expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow of the related asset group. These factors, along with management's plans with respect to the operations, are considered in assessing the recoverability of property, plant and equipment. Changes in management's estimates and plans could significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of excess capacity in the tobacco-related papers industry and increased purchased material and operating costs experienced in the last several years, competitive selling prices for certain of our products are not sufficient to cover our costs with a reasonable margin. Such competitive pressures have resulted in downtime of certain paper machines and, in some cases, accelerated depreciation or impairment of certain equipment. We have also incurred restructuring costs in our AMS segment in pursuit of synergies from integrating our acquisitions. Over the past six years, we have restructured our operations to improve our competitiveness and profitability. As a result, we incurred significant charges related to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and employee severances. In 2011, the Company revised its Asian RTL expansion plans and suspended the construction of the Philippine greenfield site. Due to this change, the carrying value of partially constructed assets was evaluated for impairment at each reporting period by assessing the recoverability of the costs based on the undiscounted cash flows of the operation, likelihood of its reactivation and alternative uses for the equipment, and, as a result of this analysis, the Company recorded an 38 impairment loss of $3.1 million during 2012. Based on an evaluation of the fair value at December 31, 2013, which used independent appraisals of certain assets, the Company recorded a $37.2 million impairment charge during 2013. There were no additional impairment charges recorded during 2014. In 2015, the Company made the decision to dispose of the facility and related equipment.  Based on an updated estimate of the fair value of the equipment in 2015, the Company recorded an additional impairment charge of $5.2 million.  During 2015, the net book value of the RTL Philippines property, plant and equipment was reclassified as Assets held for sale in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company reviews these assets at each reporting period and would recognize an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value of the assets over the fair value less any costs to sell.  The Company did not record any additional impairment charges during 2016.  During 2017, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $4.0 million related to the RTL Philippines assets. The net book value of the RTL Philippines property, plant and equipment was $12.8 million as of December 31, 2017. Management continues to evaluate how to operate our production facilities more effectively. Further restructuring actions are possible that might require additional write-offs or accelerated depreciation of some equipment. Business Combinations Accounting for business combinations requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed (""net assets"") at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair values are based upon quoted market prices and widely accepted valuation techniques, which require significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill, based on new information obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of net assets acquired, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated financial statements. See Note 3. Business Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Fair value of a reporting unit is typically based upon estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or market-based comparables. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, then an analysis will be performed to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. An impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount over its implied fair value. After an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis. The annual impairment tests performed on October 1, 2017 and 2016 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill.

The increase of $152.6 million or 54.4% was due primarily to $141.3 million in incremental net sales generated by the operations of our Conwed business and an increase in organic sales of $11.4 million, led by strong growth in transportation, mainly from surface protection films, as well as gains in industrial and medical sales; this growth was partially offset by softness in filtration sales. The EP segment net sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $548.9 million decreased by $10.4 million, or 1.9%, versus net sales of $559.3 million in the prior year.  The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of the $14.5 million net combined unfavorable impact of changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices, and $4.6 million of lower royalty income, partially offset by favorable net foreign currency impacts of $8.7 million, mainly from a stronger euro, in each case compared to the prior year.

AMS gross profit increased by $46.8 million, primarily due to the incremental gross profit associated with the operations of our newly acquired Conwed business, along with organic sales growth and a favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by certain manufacturing inefficiencies and higher input costs. In the EP segment, gross profit decreased by $21.2 million, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of lower sales combined with the lower sales volume's associated impact on manufacturing efficiencies and overhead absorption compared to the prior-year period. 41 Nonmanufacturing Expenses (dollars in millions) Percent Change   Percent of Net Sales   2017   2016   Change     2017   2016 Selling expense $ 33.3     $ 25.3     $ 8.0     31.6 %   3.4 %   3.0 % Research expense 17.8     17.5     0.3     1.7     1.8     2.1   General expense 98.4     82.2     16.2     19.7     10.0     9.8   Nonmanufacturing expenses $ 149.5     $ 125.0     $ 24.5     19.6 %   15.2 %   14.9 % Nonmanufacturing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $24.5 million, or 19.6%, to $149.5 million from $125.0 million in the prior year due primarily to incremental costs from the operations of our newly acquired Conwed business.

In the year ended December 31, 2017, restructuring and impairment expenses consisted of $3.5 million related to severance expenses in the French, Belgian and U.S. operations for ongoing accruals over the remaining service lives of affected employees related to previously announced actions as well as $4.0 million of impairment charges to certain of our RTL Philippines physical assets and $0.6 million in impairment charges for manufacturing equipment at our French and U.S. manufacturing facilities. In the year ended December 31, 2016, restructuring and impairment expenses consisted of $4.3 million related to severance expenses in the French, Brazilian and U.S. operations for ongoing accruals over the remaining service lives of affected employees related to previously announced actions as well as $0.6 million of impairment charges to certain of our Polish manufacturing equipment.  Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, in line with the Company's rebranding strategy, it was determined that use of the DelStar trade name would be discontinued in 2017.  As a result, a $20.7 million impairment charge was recognized to adjust the carrying value of the DelStar trade name intangible asset to its estimated fair value as of December 31, 2016 based on expected future cash flows to be realized from the use of the trade name.  The remaining value of this intangible was amortized in the first six months of 2017. 42 Operating Profit (dollars in millions) Percent Change   Return on Net Sales   2017   2016   Change     2017   2016 Advanced Materials & Structures $ 48.5     $ 9.0     $ 39.5     N.M     11.2 %   3.2 % Engineered Papers 116.1     138.0     (21.9 )   (15.9 )   21.2     24.7   Unallocated expenses (39.9 )   (40.9 )   1.0     2.4           Total $ 124.7     $ 106.1     $ 18.6     17.5  %   12.7 %   12.6 % N.M. - Not Meaningful Operating profit was $124.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $106.1 million during the prior year. The AMS segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $48.5 million compared to $9.0 million in the prior year period. The increase of $39.5 million in the AMS segment's operating profit during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior-year period was positively impacted by $18.6 million in decreased restructuring and impairment expenses due primarily to the prior-year's tradename impairment and $19.5 million in incremental operating profit associated with our newly acquired Conwed business and organic net sales growth and associated gross profits. The EP segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $116.1 million, a decrease of $21.9 million, or 15.9%, from $138.0 million in the prior year.  The decrease was primarily due to overall sales volume decline. Lower RTL and overall cigarette paper volumes were partially offset by growth of non-tobacco paper, and positive currency movements offset anticipated lower LIP royalties. Unallocated expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017 were $39.9 million, down $1.0 million, or 2.4%, from the $40.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower professional fees. Non-Operating Expenses, Net Interest expense was $26.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $10.3 million from $16.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.  The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding compared to the prior year in connection with the Conwed acquisition as well as the effect of the higher effective interest rate applied to borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement executed in January 2017 when compared to our previous credit agreement.  The weighted average effective interest rate on our debt facilities was approximately 3.45% and 2.42% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other income, net was $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.  The $0.2 million decrease in other income, net, was due primarily to higher net currency losses in the current year, partially offset by lower transactional taxes incurred in Brazil in the current year and lower losses incurred on the sale of assets at our Philippines site. Income Taxes A $69.6 million and $15.4 million provision for income taxes in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, resulted in an effective tax rate of 68.6% compared with 16.5% in the prior year.  The Company's effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due to varying tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, and additional taxes due to earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected the Company, which include, but are not limited to, a one-time mandatory 43 transition tax of $48.7 million on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Income from Equity Affiliates Income from equity affiliates, net of income taxes, was $2.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $4.8 million during the prior year and reflected the results of operations of CTM and CTS.  The decrease in earnings was driven primarily by lower sales volumes at CTS in 2017 compared to the prior-year period. Discontinued Operations Because we closed our Philippines plant as previously reported, the results of this plant were reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Consequently, this plant's results have been removed from each line of the statements of income and the operating activities section of the statements of cash flow. In each case, a separate line has been added for the net results of the discontinued operation. Net Income and Income per Share Net income in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $34.5 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared with $82.8 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, during the prior year period.  The decrease in net income was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the new tax legislation, the unfavorable impact of lower sales and associated gross profits in our EP segment, higher intangible asset amortization in our AMS segment as a result of the Conwed acquisition and higher interest expense. These factors were partially offset by the incremental operating profits from the Conwed acquisition, the favorable impact of higher organic sales and associated gross profits in our AMS segment and lower restructuring and impairment charges in 2017. 44 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2016   2015   Change   Percent Change Advanced Materials & Structures $ 280.6     $ 180.2     $ 100.4     55.7  % Engineered Papers 559.3     583.9     (24.6 )   (4.2 ) Total $ 839.9     $ 764.1     $ 75.8     9.9  % Net sales were $839.9 million in 2016 compared with $764.1 million in 2015.

The increase of $100.4 million or 55.7% was due primarily to $106.5 million in incremental net sales generated by the operations of our Argotec business, partially offset by $3.3 million of unfavorable net foreign currency impacts, mainly from a weaker British pound and Chinese yuan and a $2.8 million combined impact primarily from planned reductions of low margin industrial sales and a decline in sales of certain air filtration products which more than offset growth in other filtration end-markets. The EP segment net sales during the year ended December 31, 2016 of $559.3 million decreased by $24.6 million, or 4.2%, versus $583.9 million in the prior year.  The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of the $27.0 million net combined unfavorable impact of changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices, and $1.2 million of lower royalty income, partially offset by favorable net foreign currency impacts of $3.6 million, mainly from a stronger euro, in each case compared to the prior year.

The AMS segment benefited from $31.2 million in incremental gross profit associated with the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business, partially offset by $1.0 million in unfavorable net foreign currency impacts as well as a combined $3.7 million impact of a decline in net sales, primarily from planned reductions of low margin industrial sales and associated unfavorable fixed cost absorption along with a decline in sales of certain air filtration products which more than offset growth in other filtration end-markets. In the EP segment, the $0.5 million 45 net favorable combined impact of operational improvements, lower input costs and net combined changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices, along with $5.5 million in favorable net foreign currency impacts and $1.0 million in lower distribution costs were partially offset by the $1.2 million impact of lower royalty income.

These factors were partially offset by $0.4 million in favorable foreign currency impacts.

In 2016, restructuring and impairment expenses consisted of $4.3 million related to severance expenses in the French, Brazilian and U.S. operations for ongoing accruals over the remaining service lives of affected employees related to previously announced actions as well as $0.6 million of impairment charges to certain of our Polish manufacturing equipment.  Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, in line with the Company's rebranding strategy, it was decided that the use of the DelStar trade name be discontinued in 2017.  As a result, a $20.7 million impairment charge was recognized to adjust the carrying value of the DelStar trade name intangible asset to its estimated fair value as of December 31, 2016 based on expected future cash flows to be realized from the use of the name.  The remaining value of this intangible was amortized over its remaining six month useful life, which was completed in the second quarter of 2017. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's restructuring and impairment expense of $14.6 million was due to $8.0 million related to severance expenses in the French, Brazilian and U.S. operations for ongoing accruals over the remaining service lives of affected employees related to previously announced actions as well as $1.4 million of impairment charges to certain of our Polish manufacturing equipment and $5.2 million of loss recognized to adjust the recorded value of equipment at our Philippines RTL location to its net realizable value. 46 Operating Profit (dollars in millions) Percent Change   Return on Net Sales   2016   2015   Change     2016   2015 Advanced Materials & Structures $ 9.0     $ 16.7     $ (7.7 )   (46.1 )%   3.2 %   9.3 % Engineered Papers 138.0     121.5     16.5     13.6     24.7     20.8   Unallocated expenses (40.9 )   (35.2 )   (5.7 )   16.2           Total $ 106.1     $ 103.0     $ 3.1     3.0  %   12.6 %   13.5 % Operating profit was $106.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $103.0 million during the prior year. The AMS segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.0 million compared to $16.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease of $7.7 million, or 46.1% in the AMS segment's operating profit during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior-year period was partially caused by $21.5 million in increased restructuring and impairment expenses and $1.0 million in unfavorable net foreign currency impacts, partially offset by $17.7 million in incremental operating profit associated with the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business and $0.8 million in lower nonmanufacturing expenses. The AMS segment was also impacted by other factors, including a combined $3.7 million impact of a decline in net sales, including planned reductions of low margin industrial sales and associated unfavorable fixed cost absorption along with a decline in sales of certain air filtration products which more than offset growth in other filtration end-markets. The EP segment's operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2016 was $138.0 million, an increase of $16.5 million, or 13.6%, from $121.5 million in the prior year.  The increase was primarily due to $5.7 million in favorable net foreign currency translation impacts and $10.4 million in lower restructuring and impairment expenses, along with the $0.5 million net combined impact of operational improvements, lower input costs and net combined changes in volumes, mix of products sold and average selling prices, and $1.0 million in lower distribution costs which were partially offset by the $1.2 million impact of lower royalty income. Unallocated expenses in the year ended December 31, 2016 were $40.9 million compared to $35.2 million in the prior year period. The increase of $5.7 million, or 16.2%, in unallocated expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the combined impact of modestly higher legal costs relating to intellectual property litigation and proceedings in Europe, professional services fees and general increases in other expenses. Non-Operating Expenses Interest expense was $16.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.9 million from $9.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.  The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding compared to the prior year in connection with the Argotec acquisition as well as the effect of the higher effective interest rate applied to borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement executed in October 2015 when compared to our previous credit agreement.  The weighted average effective interest rate on our debt facilities was approximately 2.42% and 1.76% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other income, net was $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.  The $8.3 million decrease in other income, net, was due primarily to $2.5 million lower gain recognized related to the sale of water rights at our Spotswood, New Jersey facility, $2.6 million in lower interest income from lower cash balances outstanding during 2016, $0.9 million in lower royalties and fees earned from our joint ventures in China, $0.9 million in lower net currency gains, and $1.4 million in one-time transactional taxes incurred in Brazil and Poland during 2016, in each case compared to the prior-year period. 47 Income Taxes A $15.4 million and $21.6 million provision for income taxes in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.5% compared with 20.5% in the prior year.  The Company's effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due to varying tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Other tax rate differences result from the impact of impairment expenses related to the DelStar trade name impairment and discrete one-time benefits related to favorable deferred tax movements and income tax valuation allowances. In 2016, tax expense was favorably impacted by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax law changes in France, Poland and the state of Delaware. Income from Equity Affiliates Income from equity affiliates, net of income taxes, was $4.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $6.6 million during the prior year and reflected the results of operations of CTM and CTS.  The decrease in earnings was driven primarily by lower sales volumes at CTS in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior-year period.  In April 2016, CTM temporarily suspended production in order to bring its operations into compliance with newly effective emissions standards in China. In June, it resumed operations. This suspension did not have a material adverse impact on our financial results in 2016. Discontinued Operations Because we closed our Philippines plat as previously reported, the results of this plant were reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Consequently, this plant's results have been removed from each line of the statements of income and the operating activities section of the statements of cash flow. In each case, a separate line has been added for the net results of the discontinued operation. Net Income and Income per Share Net income in the year ended December 31, 2016 was $82.8 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, compared with $89.7 million, or $2.94 per diluted share, during the prior year period.  The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher expenses from interest and intangible asset amortization, the impact of sales declines in certain end-markets in the AMS segment along with lower income from our equity affiliates, lower interest income and impairment expense recognized due to the phase out of the DelStar trade name in 2017. These factors were partially offset by incremental income earned from the operations of our newly acquired Argotec business as well as lower restructuring expenses, primarily in our EP segment, and the net combined impact of operational improvements and net combined changes in volumes, mix of products sold, and average selling prices, along with overall favorable net foreign currency impacts. 48 Liquidity and Capital Resources A major factor in our liquidity and capital resource planning is our generation of cash flow from operations, which is sensitive to changes in the mix of products sold, volume and pricing of our products, as well as changes in our production volumes, costs and working capital. Our liquidity is supplemented by funds available under our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that is used as either operating conditions or strategic opportunities warrant. As of December 31, 2017, $76.8 million of our $106.9 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries.  Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Tax Act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. We recorded a provisional tax liability of $48.7 million relating to the one-time mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings which we intend to pay over an eight-year payment schedule as prescribed by the Tax Act. We also revalued our deferred tax liability as a result of lower expected future tax rates, resulting in a $9.1million tax benefit.  We established a partnership holding company in Luxembourg in 2014.  As a result of the holding company structure, some of the foreign earnings flow directly to the U.S., and these earnings are no longer considered to be permanently reinvested overseas. We believe that we are able to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without repatriation of the cash held by these other foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth strategy. Capital spending for 2018 is projected to be approximately $40.0 million.  We generally fund our capital projects using cash on-hand, cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities, including the Amended Credit Agreement. Cash Requirements As of December 31, 2017, we had net operating working capital of $184.2 million and cash and cash equivalents of $106.9 million, compared with net operating working capital of $124.1 million and cash and cash equivalents of $107.4 million as of December 31, 2016.  The 2017 year-over-year increase in net operating working capital is primarily due to increases in Accounts receivable and Inventories outstanding at December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 due to the addition of Conwed in 2017, and decreases in accrued income taxes. These factors were partially offset by a corresponding increase in Accounts payable due to the Conwed acquisition and a decrease in Assets held for sale outstanding at December 31, 2017. Changes in the amounts that make up these balances reflect the impacts of changes in currency exchange rates which are included in the changes in operating working capital presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. 49 Cash Flows from Operating Activities ($ in millions) For the Years Ended December 31,  2017   2016   2015 Net income $ 34.5     $ 82.8     $ 89.7   Less: Income (loss) from discontinued operations 0.1      -      (0.8 ) Income from continuing operations 34.4     82.8     90.5   Non-cash items included in net income:           Depreciation and amortization 59.5     44.5     41.0   Impairment 4.6     21.3     6.7   Deferred income tax provision (benefit) 1.6     (13.5 )   (6.7 ) Pension and other postretirement benefits 3.8     3.8     4.2   Stock-based compensation 7.1     5.8     3.5   Income from equity affiliates (2.5 )   (4.8 )   (6.6 ) Gain on sale of intangible assets  -      (1.8 )   (4.3 ) Gain on sale of assets (4.9 )    -       -    Long-term income tax payable 36.7      -       -    Excess tax benefits of stock-based awards  -      0.2     (0.5 ) Cash dividends received from equity affiliates 1.8     3.0     3.9   Other items 0.7     (0.6 )   0.1   Net changes in operating working capital (11.9 )   (11.0 )   12.8   Net cash provided (used) by operating activities of:           Continuing operations 130.9     129.7     144.6   Discontinued operations 0.1      -      0.1   Cash provided by operations $ 131.0     $ 129.7     $ 144.7 Net cash provided by operations was $131.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $129.7 million in the prior year. Our net cash provided by operations increased primarily due to a $50.6 million year-over-year increase in non-cash add backs to net income, partially offset by lower net income of $48.3 million, a $0.9 million unfavorable year-over-year impact of a net change in operating working capital and $1.2 million in lower dividends received from equity affiliates. Net cash provided by operations was $129.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $144.7 million in the prior year.  Our net cash provided by operations decreased due primarily to lower net income in 2016 compared to 2015 and a $23.8 million unfavorable year-over-year net change in operating working capital, partially offset by the impact of certain non-cash adjustments to net income, including $14.6 million in higher impairment expense, $3.5 million in higher depreciation and intangible amortization expense and $2.5 million in lower gain on the sale of water rights at our Spotswood, NJ manufacturing facility. 50 Operating Working Capital ($ in millions) For the Years Ended December 31,  2017   2016   2015 Changes in operating working capital           Accounts receivable $ (0.9 )   $ 3.1     $ (18.0 ) Inventories (6.4 )   (6.9 )   1.3   Prepaid expenses 0.8     (0.5 )   1.1   Accounts payable 4.7     (3.7 )   6.5   Accrued expenses (3.0 )   0.8     3.7   Accrued income taxes (7.1 )   (3.8 )   18.2   Net changes in operating working capital $ (11.9 )   $ (11.0 )   $ 12.8 In 2017, net changes in operating working capital decreased cash flow by $11.9 million compared with an $11.0 million decrease in cash flow in the prior year. The 2017 reduction in cash flow from the net change in working capital was driven by increases in accounts receivable and inventories, and decreases in accrued income taxes, partially offset by increases in accounts payable. In 2016, net changes in operating working capital decreased cash flow by $11.0 million compared with a $12.8 million increase in cash flow in the prior year. The 2016 reduction in cash flow from the net change in working capital was driven by increases in inventory and decreases in accounts payable and accrued income taxes, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable. In 2015, net changes in operating working capital provided cash flow of $12.8 million compared with $18.6 million in 2014.  The 2015 unfavorable net change in working capital was driven by increases in inventory and accounts receivable from acquisitions, partially offset by higher accrued expenses and accrued taxes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities ($ in millions) For the Years Ended December 31, 2017   2016   2015 Capital spending $ (37.2 )   $ (27.8 )   $ (24.2 ) Capitalized software costs (3.5 )   (2.8 )   (0.9 ) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (291.7 )    -      (280.6 ) Proceeds from sale of assets 7.0      -       -    Other 6.9     8.2     (8.0 ) Cash used for investing $ (318.5 )   $ (22.4 )   $ (313.7 ) Cash used for investing activities during 2017 was $318.5 million and consisted primarily of cash paid for the Conwed acquisition and capital spending, partially offset by $7.0 million received from the sale of assets. Cash used for investing activities during 2016 was $22.4 million and consisted primarily of capital spending, partially offset by proceeds of $4.6 million received from the sale of assets held for sale and a gain of $1.8 million on the sale of water right intangible assets at our Spotswood, NJ manufacturing facility. Cash used for investing activities during 2015 was $313.7 million and consisted primarily of funds used in the Argotec acquisition as well as capital spending, including expansion of DelStar both within its existing facilities as well as the new site in Poland. 51 Capital Spending Capital spending was $37.2 million, $27.8 million and $24.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  During 2017, 2016 and 2015, capital spending was primarily related to maintenance capital spending, capacity additions to support growth in transportation and infrastructure end-markets, construction on AMS manufacturing facilities in China and Poland, and the rebuild of certain paper manufacturing lines. We incur capital spending as necessary to meet legal requirements and otherwise in connection with the protection of the environment at our facilities in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China and Poland.  For these purposes, we expect to incur capital expenditures of less than $1.0 million in each of 2018 and 2019, of which no material amount is expected to be the result of environmental fines or settlements.  The foregoing capital expenditures are not expected to reduce our ability to invest in other appropriate and necessary capital projects and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Cash Flows from Financing Activities ($ in millions) For the Years Ended December 31, 2017   2016   2015 Cash dividends paid to SWM stockholders $ (51.9 )   $ (49.4 )   $ (46.9 ) Net (repayments on) proceeds from borrowings 233.2     (135.4 )   149.1   Payments for debt issuance costs (0.6 )    -      (7.4 ) Purchases of common stock (1.2 )   (0.7 )   (2.9 ) Excess tax benefits of stock-based awards  -      (0.2 )   0.5   Cash (used in) provided by financing $ 179.5     $ (185.7 )   $ 92.4 During 2017, financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from borrowings of $233.2 million, primarily for the acquisition of Conwed, cash dividends of $51.9 million paid to SWM stockholders and share repurchases of $1.2 million. During 2016, financing activities consisted primarily of net repayments on borrowings of $135.4 million, cash dividends of $49.4 million paid to SWM stockholders and share repurchases of $0.7 million. During 2015, financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from borrowings of $149.1 million offset by cash dividends of $46.9 million paid to SWM stockholders, payments for debt issuance costs related to the Company's Amended Credit Agreement of $7.4 million and share repurchases of $2.9 million. Dividend Payments We have declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock every fiscal quarter since the second quarter of 1996.  On February 21, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.43 per share payable on March 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 2, 2018.  Our Amended Credit Agreement covenants require that we maintain certain financial ratios, as disclosed in Note 13. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, none of which under normal business conditions materially limit our ability to pay such dividends.  We will continue to assess our dividend policy in light of our overall strategy, cash generation, debt levels and ongoing requirements for cash to fund operations and to pursue possible strategic opportunities. Share Repurchases In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 25,860 shares, 20,345 shares, and 63,365 shares, respectively, of our common stock at a cost of $1.2 million, $0.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, for the value of employees' stock-based compensation share awards surrendered to satisfy their personal statutory income tax withholding obligations. 52 Debt Instruments and Related Covenants Debt Instruments and Related Covenants ($ in millions) For the Years Ended December 31, 2017   2016   2015 Changes in short-term debt $ 1.5     $  -      $ (0.4 ) Proceeds from issuances of long-term debt 440.5     35.6     488.2   Payments on long-term debt (208.8 )   (171.0 )   (338.7 ) Net (repayments on) proceeds from borrowings $ 233.2     $ (135.4 )   $ 149.1 Net proceeds from borrowings were $233.2 million during 2017. Absent any substantial acquisition(s) or any share repurchases, the Company does not expect to incur any significant additional borrowings during 2018, however the company could choose to refinance existing borrowings using the proceeds of new borrowings or debt securities. In October 2015, Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. entered into the Amended Credit Agreement, which provides an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion, consisting of a $650 million revolving credit facility maturing in October 2020, a $100 million Term Loan A-1 maturing in October 2020, and a $250 million Term Loan A-2 maturing in October 2022.  The Term Loans are generally subject to mandatory repayment out of the net cash proceeds of asset sales which are not reinvested in operating assets. The credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries.  Availability under the Amended Credit Agreement was $278.8 million as of December 31, 2017. We also had availability under our bank overdraft facilities and lines of credit of $20.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement at December 31, 2017.   In December 2016, and effective upon consummation of the Conwed acquisition in January 2017, the company entered into an amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement which changed certain of its financial covenants as discussed in more detail in Note 13. Debt of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With the current level of borrowing and forecasted results, we expect to remain in compliance with our Amended Credit Agreement financial covenants. Our total debt to capital ratios at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were 55.6% and 46.4%, respectively. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 53 Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table represents our future contractual cash requirements for the next five years and thereafter for our long-term debt obligations and other commitments ($ in millions): Payments due for the years ended Contractual Obligations Total   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022   Thereafter Current debt (1)  $ 6.9     $ 6.9     $  -      $  -      $  -      $  -      $  -    Long-term debt (2)  683.1      -      5.2     434.6     4.4     236.0     2.9   Debt interest (3)  88.5     24.8     24.6     22.0     9.3     7.7     0.1   Restructuring obligations (4)  1.7     0.6     0.9     0.2      -       -       -    Minimum operating lease  payments (5)  33.8     6.2     5.2     4.8     4.2     3.7     9.7   Purchase obligations - raw  materials (6)  23.8     14.8     1.8     1.9     1.9     1.7     1.7   Purchase obligations - energy (7)  23.2     12.2     7.5     3.5      -       -       -    Tax Act transition obligation (8)  36.7     2.9     2.9     2.9     2.9     2.9     22.2   Other long-term liabilities (9) (10) (11) (12) 0.5     0.5      -       -       -       -       -    Total $ 898.2     $ 68.9     $ 48.1     $ 469.9     $ 22.7     $ 252.0     $ 36.6 (1) Current debt excludes debt issuance costs of $1.8 million; see Note 13, Debt. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Long-term debt excludes debt issuance costs of $3.9 million; see additional information regarding long-term debt in Note 13. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) The amounts reflected in debt interest are based upon the short-term and long-term scheduled principal maturities and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017. Where specific maturities are not stated, such as for an overdraft line-of-credit, a repayment date coinciding with the end of the year was used for purposes of these calculations. Since our debt is largely variable interest rate debt, applicable market interest rates were assumed to be the same as at December 31, 2017 for purposes of these calculations. With respect to our variable-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our debt interest obligation by $3.2 million in 2018, taking into account the affect of the interest rate hedge transactions the Company has entered into as of December 31, 2017. For more information regarding our outstanding debt and associated interest rates, as well as hedging strategies in place which serve to fix the interest rate on a large portion of our debt, see Note 13. Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Restructuring obligations are more fully discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Recent Developments and Note 12. Restructuring and Impairment Activities, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Minimum operating lease payments relate to our future minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating leases having an initial or remaining term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2017. (6) Purchase obligations for raw materials include our calcium carbonate purchase agreement at our plant in Quimperl, France, in which a vendor operates an on-site calcium carbonate plant and our plant has minimum purchase quantities. See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 54 (7) Purchase obligations for energy include obligations under agreements with (1) an energy co-generation supplier at our plants in Quimperl, France and Spay, France, to supply steam for which our plants have minimum purchase commitments, (2) a natural gas supplier to supply and distribute 100% of the natural gas needs of our three French plants, (3) an energy supplier to supply a constant supply of electricity for our Pirahy plant in Brazil, and (4) an energy supplier has a contract to provide biomass at our Spay, France facility for the next two years.  See Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (8) On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act"") into law, which requires a one-time transition tax on certain unpatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  Companies may elect to pay the tax over eight years based on an installment schedule outlined in the Tax Act.  We intend to make this election and have reflected our provisional transition tax due by year as a contractual obligation.  See Note. 16. Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (9) Other long-term liabilities exclude $1.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions for which there is no contractual obligation.  We had no other long-term liabilities as defined for purposes of this disclosure by the SEC as of December 31, 2017. (10) Other long-term liabilities do not include any amounts for our pension obligations. The pension obligations are funded by our separate pension trusts, which held $131.9 million in assets at December 31, 2017. The combined projected benefit obligation (""PBO"") of our U.S. and French pension plans was underfunded by $22.7 million and $30.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We make contributions to our pension trusts based on many factors including regulatory guidelines, investment returns of the trusts and availability of cash for pension contributions versus other priorities. We did not make contributions to our U.S. and French pension plans during 2017. We expect 2018 funding to be in compliance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. For information regarding our long-term pension obligations and trust assets, see Note 17. Postretirement and Other Benefits, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (11) Other long-term liabilities do not include any amounts for our postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits. Such payments are dependent upon our retirees incurring costs and filing claims; therefore, future payments are uncertain. Our net payments under these plans were approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Based on this past experience, we currently expect our share of the net payments to be less than $1.0 million during 2018 for these benefits. For more information regarding our retiree healthcare and life insurance benefit obligations, see Note 17. Postretirement and Other Benefits, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (12) Other long-term liabilities relate to contractual commitments for capital projects. 55 Outlook For the AMS segment, we expect our growth outlook to be driven by macro factors affecting our served end-markets, including filtration, infrastructure and construction, transportation, industrial, and medical, as well as industry demand for many of our key applications.  We expect water and other specialty filtration applications, surface protection products within transportation, and our products for infrastructure and construction end-markets to deliver growth exceeding GDP, or other global growth benchmarks, over the long-term due to the relative strong demand for the specific products we provide.  Generally, we believe that our sales into the industrial and medical end-markets will perform relatively in line with long-term broad economic growth in the U.S. and to some extent Europe and China.  For the EP segment, we expect our outlook and performance to be driven by macro factors, such as the expected long-term trend of reduced cigarette consumption and foreign exchange movements, and the potential regulatory changes in the tobacco industry such as approvals of various new reduced-risk tobacco products or tax-related price increases.  In addition, cigarette industry consolidation may play a role in affecting trends in the tobacco industry.

and  Other factors described elsewhere in this document and from time to time in documents that we file with the SEC. All forward-looking statements made in this document are qualified by these cautionary statements. Forward-looking statements herein are made only as of the date of this document, and we do not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in 58 assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. 59","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on our operating profit. Since we transact business in many countries, some of our sale and purchase transactions are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of our operations. As a result, changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which the transaction is denominated versus the local currency of our operation into which the transaction is being recorded can impact the amount of local currency recorded for such transaction. This can result in more or less local currency revenue or cost related to such transaction and thus have an effect on our operating profit. Currency transaction risk is mitigated partially in France as some of the revenue and expense transactions of our French subsidiaries are denominated in U.S. dollars, providing a degree of natural hedging. Our Brazilian and Polish operations are more fully exposed to currency transaction risk, especially as a result of U.S. dollar and euro denominated sales, respectively. Additionally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on the amount reported in other income (expense), net. Once the above-indicated receivables and payables from the sale and purchase transactions have been recorded, to the extent currency exchange rates change prior to settlement of the balance, a gain or loss on the non-local currency denominated asset or liability balance may be experienced, in which case such gain or loss is included in other income (expense), net. We utilize forward and swap contracts and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk when it is practical and economical to do so. The use of these contracts minimizes transactional exposure to exchange rate changes because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instrument will offset, in whole or in part, the loss or gain on the underlying foreign currency exposure. These instruments are entered into with money center banks, insurance companies or government agencies, collectively known as counterparties.  We expect to continue to apply foreign currency hedging in our Brazilian and Polish operations in the foreseeable future.  As of December 31, 2017, a 10% unfavorable change in the exchange rate of our functional currencies and those of our subsidiaries against the prevailing market rates of non-local currencies involving our transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pre-tax loss of approximately $3 million. These hypothetical gains or losses on foreign currency transactional exposures are based on the December 31, 2017 rates and the assumed rates. While we believe the above loss resulting from the hypothetical unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could be material to our results of operations, we reduce this risk by selectively hedging our exposure when it is practical and economical to do so. Interest Rate Risk We may utilize a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt consisting of short-term and long-term instruments. We selectively hedge our exposure to interest rate increases on our variable-rate, long-term debt when it is practical and economical to do so. We have utilized various forms of interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements. We utilize variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements, typically with contractual terms no longer than 60 months, which serve to convert a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt to a fixed rate. Various outstanding interest-bearing instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. With respect to our variable-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a $3 million decrease to our future annual pre-tax earnings, taking into account the affect of the interest rate hedge transactions the Company has entered into as of December 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company does not have significant fixed-rate debt outstanding.  As of December 31, 2017 the Company has entered into interest rate hedge transactions which have the effect of fixing the interest rate on approximately 54% of our debt subject to variable interest rates. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to commodity price risks from our purchases of raw materials, including resin and wood pulp. Resin is the largest single component of raw material cost in the AMS segment and wood pulp is our largest single component of raw material cost in our EP segment. The per pound price of resin is volatile and may impact the future results of 60 our AMS segment. Additionally, the per ton cost of wood pulp is cyclical in nature and more volatile than general inflation. During the period from January 2013 through December 2017, the U.S. list price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp (""NBSK"") a representative pulp grade that we use, increased by approximately 35%. We normally maintain approximately 50 to 90 days of inventories to support our operations. As a result, there is a lag in the impact of changes in the per ton list price of resin and wood pulp on our cost of products sold. In our AMS segment, we utilize a variety of commodity grade and specialty resins, including a selection of specialized high temperature engineering grade resins. Certain of these specialty resins are significantly more expensive than commodity grade resins. Resin prices fluctuate significantly and can impact profitability. As we periodically enter into agreements with customers under which we agree to supply products at fixed prices, unanticipated increases in the costs of raw materials, or the lack of availability of such raw materials (due to force majeure or other reasons), can significantly impact our financial performance. Even where we do not have fixed-price agreements, we generally cannot pass through increases in raw material costs in a timely manner and in many instances are not able to pass through the entire increase to our customers. Further, some of the resins we use in our AMS segment are only available from a single supplier, or a limited number of suppliers. Consequently, such supplier(s) can control the availability and thus the cost of the resins we use, notwithstanding any changes in the cost of oil. It can be time consuming and costly, and occasionally impractical, to find replacement resins where such suppliers limit the availability or increase the cost of resins we use. Commodity grade resin prices typically correlate with crude oil prices while specialty resin prices often do not.  To date, we have not utilized derivative instruments to manage this risk.  With respect to our commodity price risk, a hypothetical 10% change in per ton resin prices would impact our future annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $13 million, assuming no compensating change in our selling prices. Selling prices of our paper products are influenced, in part, by the market price for wood pulp, which is determined by worldwide industry supply and demand. Generally, over time, we have been able to increase our selling prices in response to increases in per ton wood pulp costs and have generally reduced our selling prices when wood pulp costs have significantly declined. Increases in prices of wood pulp could adversely impact our earnings if selling prices are not increased or if such increases do not fully compensate for or trail the increases in wood pulp prices. We have not utilized derivative instruments to manage this risk. With respect to our commodity price risk, a hypothetical 10% change in per ton wood pulp prices would impact our future annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $4 million, assuming no compensating change in our selling prices. We believe that, while our exposure to commodity price risk is material to our results of operations, our customers understand such risk and over time changes in the price of the commodities used in our manufacturing processes are typically reflected in selling prices. Energy Supply and Cost Volatility In France, Poland, China and in the U.S., availability of energy is generally reliable, although prices can fluctuate significantly based on variations in demand. In Brazil, where that country's production of electricity is heavily reliant upon hydroelectric plants, availability of electricity has been affected in the past by rain variations. Although our Brazilian business currently has a sufficient supply of energy to continue its current level of operation, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient electricity in the future, or that costs will remain stable. Due to the competitive pricing in the markets for most of our products, we are typically unable to fully pass through higher energy costs to our customers. With respect to our purchased energy price risk, a hypothetical 10% change in per unit prices would impact our future annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $4 million, assuming no compensating change in our selling prices. Periodically, when we believe it is appropriate to do so, we enter into agreements to procure a portion of our energy for future periods in order to reduce the uncertainty of future energy costs. However, in recent years this has only marginally slowed the increase in energy costs due to the volatile changes in energy prices we have experienced. 61","Item 8.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. General Nature of Business Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc., or SWM or the Company, headquartered in the United States of America, is a multinational diversified producer of highly engineered solutions and advanced materials for a variety of industries.  The Company maintains two operating product line segments: Advanced Materials and Structures and Engineered Papers. The Advanced Materials & Structures segment, or AMS, produces mostly resin-based rolled goods such as nets, films and meltblown materials, typically through an extrusion process or other non-woven technologies. These products are used in a variety of specialty applications across the filtration, construction and infrastructure, transportation, industrial and medical end-markets. As discussed more fully in Note 3. Business Acquisitions, in January 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Conwed Plastics LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and its Belgian subsidiary (""Conwed NV"" and collectively with Conwed Plastic LLC, ""Conwed""), which has been integrated into the AMS segment. The Engineered Papers segment, or EP, primarily serves the tobacco industry with production of various cigarette papers and reconstituted tobacco products, or ""recon"". Traditional reconstituted tobacco leaf, or ""RTL"", is used as a blend with virgin tobacco in cigarettes and used as wrappers and binders for cigars. Recon, as well as LIP (low ignition propensity) cigarette paper, a specialty product with fire-safety features, are two key profit drivers, which together account for more than half of segment net sales. The EP segment also produces non-tobacco papers for both premium applications, such as energy storage, and industrial commodity paper grades, which are often produced to maximize machine utilization. We conduct business in over 90 countries and operate 23 production locations worldwide, with facilities in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Russia, Brazil, China and Poland.  We also have a 50% equity interest in two joint ventures in China. The first, China Tobacco Mauduit (Jiangmen) Paper Industry Ltd., or CTM, produces cigarette and porous plug wrap papers and the second, China Tobacco Schweitzer (Yunnan) Reconstituted Tobacco Co. Ltd., or CTS, produces RTL. As used in this 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context indicates otherwise, references to ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our,"" ""SWM,"" ""Schweitzer-Mauduit"" or similar terms include Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are reasonable, based upon currently available facts and known circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions as a result of a number of factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this report and in its other public filings from time to time. 68 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries.  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications of prior year data were made in the notes to consolidated financial statements.  The reclassifications were made to conform to the current year presentation. The Company uses the equity method to account for its investments in two joint ventures with the China National Tobacco Corporation (see Note 8. Joint Ventures).  Investment in equity affiliates represents the Company's investment in these joint ventures. The Company's 50% share of the net income (loss) of the joint ventures is included in the consolidated statements of income as income (loss) from equity affiliates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue and the related accounts receivable when the following four criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) ownership has transferred to the customer; (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured based on the Company's judgment regarding the collectability of its accounts receivable. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue when it ships its manufactured product and title and risk of loss passes to its customer in accordance with the terms of sale of the product. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board, shipping point, or equivalent. For sales transactions designated free on board, destination, or equivalent, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site, at which time title and risk of loss are transferred. Provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue is recorded. Deferred revenue represents advance payments from customers which are earned based upon a mutually agreed-upon amount per unit of future product sales. Freight Costs The cost of delivering finished goods to the Company's customers is recorded as a component of cost of products sold. Those costs include the amounts paid to a third party to deliver the finished goods. Any freight costs billed to and paid by a customer are included in revenue. Royalty Income Royalties from third-party patent licenses are recognized when earned, including monies received at an agreement's initiation attributable to past sales. The Company recognizes up-front payments upon receipt when it has no future performance requirement or ongoing obligation arising from its agreements and the payment is for a separate earnings process. Minimum annual royalties received in advance are deferred and are recognized in the period earned.  The Company recognized $3.9 million, $8.3 million and $9.6 million of royalty income during 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively, which is included in net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign Currency Translation The income statements of foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the periods presented. The balance sheets of these entities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and the differences from historical exchange rates are reflected in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign currency risks arise from transactions and balances denominated in non-local currencies. Gains and losses resulting from re-measurement and settlement of such transactions and balances, included in other income (expense), net, were a loss of $3.5 million, a loss of $0.2 million and a gain of $0.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 69 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Derivative Instruments The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Company utilizes a variety of practices to manage these market risks, including where considered appropriate, derivative instruments. The Company uses derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and not for trading or speculation. All derivative instruments the Company uses are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties.  The Company believes the credit risks with respect to the counterparties, and the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged if the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, are not material in view of its understanding of the financial strength of the counterparties. Gains and losses on instruments that hedge firm commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying hedged items. All other hedging gains and losses are included in period income or expense based on the period-end market price of the instrument and are included in the Company's operating cash flows. See Note 14. Derivatives, for additional information. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid, unrestricted investments with remaining maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents, including money market funds with no restrictions on withdrawals. Business Combinations The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. At the acquisition date, the Company records assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values. The Company estimates fair value using the exit price approach which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market.  An exit price is determined from a market participant's viewpoint in the principal or most advantageous market and may result in the Company valuing assets or liabilities at a fair value that is not reflective of the Company's intended use of the assets or liabilities.  Any excess consideration above the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The operating results of acquired businesses are included in the Company's results of operations beginning as of their effective acquisition dates.  Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and were $0.2 million, $1.8 million, and $2.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant a review. Goodwill is also tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter. Goodwill may be evaluated using a qualitative evaluation and/or a two-step test at the reporting unit level. The first step compares the book value of the reporting unit to its fair value. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company performs the second step. In the second step, the Company determines an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill. The difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill. Any impairment loss is measured as the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. See Note 9. Goodwill for further discussion of the Company's annual impairment test results.  During the annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2017, the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units was in excess of its respective carrying value. We have acquired trade names that have been determined to have indefinite lives. We evaluate a number of factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, category share, business history, product life cycle and operating plans. Indefinite-lived intangibles are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter. Additionally, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived trade names may be adjusted to a determinable life or an impairment charge may be 70 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS recorded. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company made a strategic decision to transition away from certain legacy business trade names associated with our recent acquisitions in favor of a streamlined SWM branding approach.  As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recognized an impairment loss related to the DelStar trade name, the financial impact of which is described in Note 10. Intangible Assets. The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, which approximates a straight-line basis, over the estimated periods benefited. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted. The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed to determine if events or circumstances have changed which may indicate that the assets may be impaired or the useful life may need to be changed. Upon occurrence of such a triggering event, the Company considers internal and external factors relating to each asset group, including expectation of future profitability, undiscounted cash flows and its plans with respect to the operations. If impairment is indicated, an impairment loss is measured by the amount the net carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Environmental Spending Environmental spending is capitalized if such spending qualifies as property, plant and equipment, substantially increases the economic value or extends the useful life of an asset. All other such spending is expensed as incurred, including fines and penalties incurred in connection with environmental violations. Environmental spending relating to an existing condition caused by past operations is expensed. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or commitment to a formal plan of action. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain purchases of software and software development costs in connection with major projects of software development for internal use. These costs are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life not to exceed seven years. Costs associated with business process redesign, end-user training, system start-up and ongoing software maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Amortization of capitalized software was $1.1 million, $1.0 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Accumulated amortization of capitalized software costs was $35.4 million and $31.5 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Business Tax Credits Business tax credits represent value added tax credits receivable and similar assets, such as Imposto sobre Circulao de Mercadorias e Servios, or ICMS, in Brazil. Business tax credits are generated when value-added taxes, or VAT, are paid on purchases. VAT and similar taxes are collected from customers on certain sales. In some jurisdictions, export sales do not require VAT collection.  See Note 11. Other Assets for additional information. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results 71 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of recent operations. If it is determined that the Company would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it is determined whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected SWM, which include, but are not limited to, a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company is required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which allows the Company to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation is expected over the next 12 months, the Company considers the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and its ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. The Company expects to complete its analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Accounting The Company recognizes the estimated compensation cost of employees' pension and other postretirement benefits over their approximate period of service. The Company's earnings are impacted by amounts of expense recorded related to these benefits, which primarily consist of U.S. and French pension benefits and U.S. other postretirement benefits, or OPEBs. Each year's recorded expenses are estimates based on actuarial calculations of the Company's accumulated and projected benefit obligations, or PBOs, for the Company's various plans. Suspension of additional benefits for future service is considered a curtailment, and if material, necessitates a re-measurement of plan assets and PBO. As part of a re-measurement, the Company adjusts its discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, such as retirement, turnover and mortality table assumptions, as appropriate.  See Note 17. Postretirement and Other Benefits for additional information. 72 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes net income, as well as items charged and credited directly to stockholders' equity, which are excluded from net income. The Company has presented comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Reclassification adjustments of derivative instruments are presented in Net sales and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 14. Derivatives for additional information.  Amortization of accumulated pension and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities are included in the computation of net periodic pension and OPEB costs, which are more fully discussed in Note 17. Postretirement and Other Benefits. Components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows ($ in millions): December 31,   2017   2016 Accumulated pension and OPEB liability adjustments, net of income tax benefit of $13.8 million and $17.6 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively $ (24.9 )   $ (36.5 ) Accumulated unrealized loss on derivative instruments, net of income tax benefit of $0.2 million and $3.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively 0.4     (1.9 ) Accumulated unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments, net of income tax benefit of $4.5 million and $0.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (64.9 )   (100.9 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (89.4 )   $ (139.3 ) Changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows ($ in millions): For the Years Ended December 31,    2017   2016   2015   Pre-tax   Tax   Net of Tax   Pre-tax   Tax   Net of Tax   Pre-tax   Tax   Net of Tax Pension and OPEB liability adjustments $ 15.4     $ (3.8 )   $ 11.6     $ 3.4     $ (4.3 )   $ (0.9 )   $ 1.9     $ 0.9     $ 2.8   Derivative instrument adjustments 5.1     (2.8 )   2.3     23.0     (3.3 )   19.7     (13.6 )   0.3     (13.3 ) Unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 31.5     4.5     36.0     (16.7 )    -      (16.7 )   (54.4 )    -      (54.4 ) Total $ 52.0     $ (2.1 )   $ 49.9     $ 9.7     $ (7.6 )   $ 2.1     $ (66.1 )   $ 1.2     $ (64.9 ) Restricted Stock All of the Company's restricted stock grants, including those that have been earned in the case of performance-based shares and cliff-vesting grants that are not performance based, vest upon completion of a specified period of time, typically between two and four years. The fair value of each award is equal to the share price of the Company's stock on the date of the grant. This cost is recognized over the vesting period of the respective award.  The Company records forfeitures of shares related to continued service requirements as they occur.  A summary of outstanding restricted stock awards as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is included in Note 18. Stockholders' Equity. Restricted Stock Plan Performance Based Shares The Company's long-term incentive compensation program, or LTICP, for key employees includes an equity-based award component that is provided through the Long-term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, which the Company adopted in 2015 and which replaced its previous Restricted Stock Plan, or RSP. The objectives under the LTICP are established at the beginning of a performance cycle and are intended to focus management on longer-term strategic goals. The 73 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors designates participants in the LTICP and LTIP and determines the equity-based award opportunity in the form of restricted stock for each performance cycle, which is generally measured on the basis of a one year performance period (the measurement period). The restricted shares are considered issued and outstanding when the number of shares becomes fixed, after the annual performance is determined, and such awards vest at the end of the performance year or some predetermined period thereafter. The Company recognizes compensation expense with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in-capital over the performance period based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, with compensation expense being adjusted cumulatively based on the number of shares expected to be earned according to the level of achievement of performance goals. Fair Value Option The Company has elected not to measure its financial instruments or certain commitments at fair value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (Topic 606). This guidance specifies how and when an entity will recognize revenue arising from contracts with customers and requires entities to disclose information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018, utilizing the modified retrospective transition approach upon adoption. This approach requires an adjustment upon adoption to the financial statements to reflect the cumulative impact of the guidance and results in no change to prior period financial statements. Based on the evaluation of the provisions included in the new guidance, along with the related updates discussed below, the adoption of this guidance will not materially impact the amount or timing of revenues recognized in the consolidated financial statements or materially affect our financial position. The Company has two main sources of revenue: product sales and materials conversion. The Company recognizes product sales revenues when control of a product is transferred to the customer. For the majority of product sales, transfer of control occurs when the products are shipped from one of the Company's manufacturing facilities to the customer. The cost of delivering finished goods to the Company's customers is recorded as a component of cost of products sold. Those costs include the amounts paid to a third party to deliver the finished goods. Any freight costs billed to and paid by a customer are included in net sales. The Company provides services to customers in conversion of customer-owned raw materials into processed finished goods.  In these transactions, the Company generally recognizes revenue as processing occurs. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied, which generally occurs when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, the Company considers collectability of amounts due under a contract to be probable upon inception of a sale based on an evaluation of the credit worthiness of each customer. If collectability is not considered to be probable, the Company defers recognition of revenue on satisfied performance obligations until the uncertainty is resolved. Any variable consideration, such as discounts or price concessions, is set forth in the terms of the contract at inception, and is included in the assessment of the transaction price at the outset of the arrangement. The transaction price is allocated to the individual performance obligations due under the contract based on the relative stand-alone fair value of the performance obligations identified in the contract. The Company typically uses an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations. Depending on the terms of an arrangement, the Company may defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received or receivable, including amounts considered refundable, which is dependent on satisfaction of a future performance obligation. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense in the period incurred. The Company generally expenses sales commissions and other costs to obtain a contract when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses. The Company does not disclose the value of  unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original 74 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.  As a practical expedient, the Company treats shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the good transfers as fulfillment activities, and therefore, does not account for shipping and handling costs as a separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, ""Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."" This update requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using the Last-in, First-out or the retail inventory method. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2017. Adoption of ASU 2015-11 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification."" The new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted. Companies must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement on the Company's outstanding leases and expects that adoption will have an impact on the consolidated balance sheets related to recording right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities.  Further, the Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on the consolidated statements of income. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.""  This standard makes several modifications to existing guidance related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter.  The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2017. Adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),"" ASU 2016-10, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,"" ASU 2016-11, ""Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting,"" and ASU 2016-12, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,"" which provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASC 2014-09. ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11 and ASU 2016-12 must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2014-09.  The Company is currently in the process of finalizing the financial statement disclosures required under ASU 2014-09 that will be incorporated in the Company's Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018 upon adoption of the guidance but does not expect that adoption of these updates will materially affect our financial position or materially impact the amount or timing of revenues recognized in the consolidated financial statements, as discussed above. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, ""Income Taxes (Topic 718): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.""  This standard states that an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, thus eliminating the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2018, utilizing the modified retrospective basis transition approach 75 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS upon adoption. The adoption of this guidance will result in a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings of $2.2 million as of January 1, 2018. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, ""Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business."" The guidance clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of assisting entities in evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Acquisitions of integrated sets of assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions.  The new update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 will be implemented on a prospective basis in the first quarter of 2018 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The amendment eliminates the second step of the analysis that required the measurement of a goodwill impairment by comparing the implied value of a reporting unit's goodwill and the goodwill's carrying amount. This guidance is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, ""Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost."" The amendment requires an employer to report the service cost component in the same line item or line items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal from operations. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company will adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2018, utilizing the retrospective transition approach upon adoption. The adoption of this guidance will result in a reclassification of the components of net periodic pension cost, other than service cost, from Cost of products sold and General expense to Other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The reclassification of these costs effects only the EP segment, as there are no pension costs associated with the AMS segment. The adoption of this guidance will have no effect on Net income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and no effect on the other consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, ""Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting"". This amendment clarifies the changes to terms or conditions of a share-based payment award that require an entity to apply modification accounting. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted and prospective application is required. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 will be implemented on a prospective basis in the first quarter of 2018 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, ""Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities."" This amendment better aligns an entity's risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. ASU 2017-12 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application is permitted and should be applied to hedging relationships existing on the date of adoption. The effect of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ""Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."" In February 2018, this ASU was issued following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") of 2017. This ASU allows an entity to elect a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded effects resulting from the Tax Act. ASU 2018-02 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied either in the period of adoption or 76 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 3. Business Acquisitions On January 20, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Conwed pursuant to the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 14, 2016, by and among the Company, Delstar Technologies, Inc., Baldwin Enterprises, Inc., Conwed and Leucadia National Corporation. As a result of the transaction, Conwed and its subsidiaries became wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company. The acquisition of Conwed expanded and continued the diversification of SWM's global presence in advanced materials and has been integrated into the Company's AMS segment. The consideration transferred to acquire Conwed was $295.0 million in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, plus three potential earn-out payments not to exceed $40.0 million in the aggregate, which payments are contingent upon the achievement of certain financial metrics in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021, in each case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement.  The estimated fair value of the potential earn-out payments at the acquisition date was $8.6 million, for total consideration transferred of $303.6 million. The estimated fair value of the deferred contingent consideration was determined based on management's projections related to the achievement of certain financial metrics for the aforementioned years. The discount rate used to value the liability was based on specific business risk, cost of capital and other factors. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using significant unobservable inputs and is considered a Level 3 liability. There were no changes to the assumptions underlying the estimated fair value calculation during the year ended December 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2017, the balance of the contingent liability was $9.5 million, including $0.9 million in accretion year-to-date. The purchase price for Conwed was funded from the Company's borrowings under the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, while the purchase price for Conwed NV was funded from cash on hand. See Note 13. Debt, for additional information. 77 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The consideration paid for Conwed and the final fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the January 20, 2017 acquisition date were as follows ($ in millions): Fair Value as of January 20, 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3.3   Accounts receivable 15.4   Inventory 20.6   Other current assets 1.1   Property, plant and equipment 31.7   Identifiable intangible assets 134.4   Total assets 206.5       Accounts payable 8.2   Deferred tax liabilities 0.9       Net assets acquired 197.4       Goodwill 106.2       Total consideration $ 303.6 The Company used the income, market, or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate, and used valuation inputs in these models and analyses that were based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to be buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. For certain items, the carrying amount was determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information available to SWM management. The fair value of receivables acquired from Conwed on January 20, 2017 was $15.4 million, with gross contractual amounts receivable of $15.8 million. Acquired inventories and property, plant and equipment were recorded at their fair values. Acquired intangible assets are primarily customer relationships, developed technology, trade names and non-competition agreements. The fair value of the inventory acquired from Conwed on January 20, 2017 was $20.6 million, which included a step-up in basis of $2.9 million.  Finished goods and work-in-process inventory was valued using the comparative sales method, which is a function of the estimated selling price less the sum of (a) any cost to complete, (b) costs of disposal, (c) holding costs and (d) a reasonable profit for allowance for the acquirer.  Raw materials were valued using the replacement cost method of the cost approach. Properties acquired included manufacturing and related facilities, land and leased sites that include leasehold improvements, and machinery and equipment for use in manufacturing operations. Management valued properties using the market and cost approaches, supported where available by observable market data which included consideration of obsolescence. 78 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intangible assets acquired included a number of customer relationships in the infrastructure, construction and industrial end-markets. In addition to these intangible assets, the Company acquired a number of patented and unpatented technologies, a number of business-to-business trade names and non-competition agreements. Management valued intangible assets using the relief from royalty, multi-period excess earnings and with-and-without methods, all forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies. The following table shows the fair values assigned to intangible assets ($ in millions): Fair Value as of January 20, 2017   Weighted-Average Amortization Period (Years) Amortizable intangible assets:       Customer relationships $ 108.0     15.0 Developed technology 18.1     17.2 Non-competition agreements 1.2     7.2 Total amortizable intangible assets 127.3       Indefinite-lived intangible assets:       Trade names 7.1     Indefinite Total $ 134.4 In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill, which represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. The goodwill is attributed primarily to Conwed's revenue growth and potential operational synergies from combining the SWM and Conwed businesses and workforces as well as the benefits of access to different markets and customers. Goodwill from the Conwed acquisition was assigned to the AMS reportable segment. The goodwill was determined on the basis of the fair values of the assets and liabilities identified as part of the transaction. The goodwill acquired in connection with Conwed and its domestic subsidiaries is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill associated with Conwed NV is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $0.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in direct and indirect acquisition-related costs.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $0.6 million in financing costs related to the acquisition. Direct and indirect acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in the General expense line item in the consolidated statements of income. Financing costs related to expanding the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below) have been capitalized and will be amortized in Interest expense over the life of the Amended Credit Agreement. The amounts of Net sales and Income from continuing operations of Conwed  included in the Company's consolidated income statement from the acquisition date are as follows ($ in millions): Net Sales   Income from Continuing Operations January 21, 2017 - December 31, 2017   $ 141.3     $ 11.9 The amounts of the unaudited pro forma Net sales and Income from continuing operations of the combined entity had the acquisition date been January 1, 2016 are as follows ($ in millions): Net Sales   Income from Continuing Operations 2017 Supplemental Pro Forma from January 1, 2017 - December 31, 2017   $ 989.8     $ 31.1   2016 Supplemental Pro Forma from January 1, 2016 - December 31, 2016   984.1     90.6 79 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On October 28, 2015, the Company acquired Argotec Intermediate Holdings, LLC, or Argotec, through an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement entered into, by and among the Company, SWM Argotec, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Argotec Intermediate Holdings Two LLC, and certain equity holders of Argotec Holdings LLC.  The acquisition of Argotec expanded and diversified SWM's global presence in advanced materials and is now a part of the Company's AMS segment. Total consideration paid by the Company was $282.7 million in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, primarily for the adjusted value of working capital at the acquisition date.  The acquisition was financed using borrowings under the Company's Amended Credit Agreement, see Note 13. Debt, for additional information. The consideration paid for Argotec and the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the October 28, 2015 acquisition date were as follows ($ in millions): Fair Value as of October 28, 2015 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2.7   Accounts receivable 16.1   Inventory 16.3   Other current assets 0.1   Property, plant and equipment 15.9   Other noncurrent assets 0.9   Identifiable intangible assets 130.5   Total assets 182.5       Accounts payable 4.6   Accrued expenses 4.5       Net assets acquired 173.4       Goodwill 109.3       Cash paid $ 282.7 The Company used the income, market, or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate, and used valuation inputs in these models and analyses that were based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to be buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. For certain items, the carrying amount was determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information available to SWM management. The fair value of receivables acquired from Argotec on October 28, 2015 was $16.1 million, with gross contractual amounts receivable of $16.8 million. Acquired inventories and property, plant and equipment were recorded at their fair values. Acquired intangible assets are primarily customer relationships, trade names and non-competition agreements. Properties acquired included a manufacturing and related facility, land and leased sites that include leasehold improvements, and machinery and equipment for use in manufacturing operations. Management valued properties using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data which included consideration of obsolescence.  One of the properties acquired, the Argotec-Stevens facility in Easthampton, Massachusetts with an estimated fair value of $1.0 million, was held for sale as of the acquisition date and during the fourth quarter of 2015 came under contract for sale to a third party.  The sale of this property was completed in April 2016 and no gain or loss was recognized on the disposition. 80 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intangible assets acquired included trade names that are both business-to-business and business-to-consumer. In addition to these intangible assets, the Company acquired a number of customer relationships in the aeronautical, transportation, graphics, medical and industrial markets. Management valued intangible assets using the relief from royalty and multi-period excess earnings methods, both forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies. The following table shows the fair values assigned to intangible assets ($ in millions): Fair Value as of October 28, 2015   Weighted-Average Amortization Period (Years) Amortizable intangible assets:       Customer relationships $ 115.9     15 Non-competition agreements 1.7     4 Indefinite-lived intangible assets:       Trade names 12.9     Indefinite Total $ 130.5 In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill, which represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. The goodwill is attributed primarily to Argotec's revenue growth from combining the SWM and Argotec business and workforce as well as the benefits of access to different markets and customers. Goodwill from the Argotec acquisition was assigned to the AMS reportable segment. The goodwill from this acquisition was determined on the basis of the preliminary fair values of the assets and liabilities identified as part of the transaction and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. In 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $0.4 million and $1.8 million in direct and indirect acquisition-related costs.  In 2015, the Company incurred $7.4 million in financing costs related to the acquisition. Direct and indirect acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in the General Expense line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Financing costs related to expanding the Credit Agreement have been capitalized and will be amortized in Interest Expense over the life of the Credit Agreement. The amounts of the acquisition's Net Sales and Income from Continuing Operations included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the unaudited pro forma Net Sales and Income from Continuing Operations of the combined entity had the acquisition date been January 1, 2015 are as follows ($ in millions): Net Sales   Income from Continuing Operations Actual from October 28, 2015 - December 31, 2015   $ 22.3     $ 0.9             2015 Supplemental Pro Forma from January 1, 2015 - December 31, 2015   859.7     90.2 81 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 4. Discontinued Operations The Company's former paper plant in San Pedro, Philippines has been reported as discontinued operations. This operation was previously presented as a component of the EP segment. For all periods presented, results of this plant have been removed from each individual line within the statements of income and the operating activities section of the statements of cash flow. In each case, a separate line has been added for the net results of discontinued operations. Included in Other Assets and Accrued Expenses within the Consolidated Balance Sheets were the following major classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, associated with the discontinued operations ($ in millions): December 31, 2017   December 31, 2016 Assets of discontinued operations:       Current assets $ 1.0     $ 1.0   Other assets 2.4     2.5           Liabilities of discontinued operations:           Current liabilities 0.1     0.1 Summary financial results of discontinued operations were as follows ($ in millions): For the Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Net sales $  -      $  -      $  -    Other income (expense) 0.1      -      (0.7 ) Loss from discontinued operations before income taxes 0.1      -      (0.7 ) Income tax (provision) benefit  -       -      (0.1 ) Loss from discontinued operations 0.1      -      (0.8 ) Note 5.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 6. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (using the First-In, First-Out and weighted average methods) or market. The Company's costs included in inventory primarily include resins, pulp, chemicals, direct labor, utilities, maintenance, depreciation, finishing supplies and an allocation of certain overhead costs. Machine start-up costs or abnormal machine shut downs are expensed in the period incurred and are not reflected in inventory. The definition of market value, with respect to all inventories, is net realizable value. The Company reviews inventories at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write-offs for excess, obsolete or unsalable inventory. The Company estimates write-offs for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. These reviews require the Company to assess customer and market demand. The following schedule details inventories by major class ($ in millions): December 31,   2017   2016 Raw materials $ 50.4     $ 40.9   Work in process 21.3     23.9   Finished goods 74.2     44.9   Supplies and other 9.3     9.7   Total $ 155.2     $ 119.4 Note 7. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Interest is capitalized as a component of the cost of construction for large projects. Expenditures for betterments are capitalized whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Property, other than land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes. When property is sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or loss on the transaction is normally included in cost of products sold. Property, plant and equipment (and related depreciable lives) consisted of the following ($ in millions): December 31,   2017   2016 Land and improvements $ 15.3     $ 11.2   Buildings and improvements (20 to 40 years or remaining life of relevant lease) 145.1     118.5   Machinery and equipment (5 to 20 years) 621.9     526.1   Construction in progress 28.1     28.3   Gross property, plant and equipment 810.4     684.1   Less: Accumulated depreciation 448.5     376.7   Property, plant and equipment, net $ 361.9     $ 307.4 Depreciation expense was $35.7 million, $29.4 million and $30.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  During 2015, the physical assets of our RTL facility in the Philippines were reclassified from Property, plant and equipment, net to Assets held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At December 31, 2017, the net realizable value of these assets was $12.8 million. 83 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 8. Joint Ventures The Company has two joint ventures with China National Tobacco Corporation, or CNTC.  CNTC is the principal operating Company under China's State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. CNTC and the Company's subsidiary, Schweitzer-Mauduit International China, Limited, or SM-China, each own 50% of each of the joint ventures.  The paper joint venture China Tobacco Mauduit (Jiangmen) Paper Industry Co. LTD, or CTM, produces tobacco-related papers in China.  The second joint venture China Tobacco Schweitzer (Yunnan) Reconstituted Tobacco Co. LTD, or CTS, produces reconstituted tobacco leaf products.  The joint ventures pay to each the Company and CNTC sales-based royalties and management fees, of which SWM recognized $2.1 million, $2.0 million and $2.9 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in other income, net in the consolidated statements of income. The Company uses the equity method to account for its ownership interest in both joint ventures.  At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's equity investment in joint ventures was $68.5 million and $63.8 million, respectively. The Company's share of the net income (loss) was included in income (loss) from equity affiliates within the consolidated statements of income.  Below is summarized balance sheet information as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and statement of operations information of the China joint ventures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 ($ in millions): December 31,   2017   2016 Current assets $ 112.4     $ 118.6   Noncurrent assets 205.3     201.7   Current liabilities 64.8     69.6   Long-term liabilities 114.7     122.0   Stockholder's equity 138.2     128.7 Summary financial results of joint ventures were as follows ($ in millions): For the Years Ended December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Net sales $ 105.0     $ 107.5     $ 122.0   Gross profit 28.8     36.5     42.7   Net income 4.9     9.5     13.2 84 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC.

The annual tests during the fourth quarters of 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted in no impairment. Each of the Company's two reportable segments, AMS and EP, have goodwill. There are no accumulated impairment losses in the AMS segment as of December 31, 2017.  The EP segment has recorded $2.7 million in accumulated impairment losses in previous years. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each reportable segment were as follows ($ in millions): Advanced Materials & Structures   Engineered Papers   Total Goodwill as of December 31, 2015 $ 228.5     $ 4.8     $ 233.3   Goodwill adjusted during the year (0.2 )    -      (0.2 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments (3.5 )   (0.1 )   (3.6 ) Goodwill as of December 31, 2016 $ 224.8     $ 4.7     $ 229.5   Goodwill acquired during the year 106.2      -      106.2   Foreign currency translation adjustments 5.1     0.5     5.6   Goodwill as of December 31, 2017 $ 336.1     $ 5.2     $ 341.3 Note 10.

Incremental amortization expense of intangible assets for the Conwed acquisition was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Finite-lived intangibles in the AMS segment are expensed using the straight-line amortization method. In our AMS segment, the Company made a strategic decision to transition away from certain legacy business trade names associated with its recent acquisitions in favor of a streamlined SWM branding approach.  As a result of adopting this branding strategy, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recognized an impairment expense of $20.7 million, representing a write-down of the DelStar trade name intangible asset to its fair market value, leaving a remaining balance of $0.8 million, which was fully amortized over the first six months of 2017, as the DelStar trade name is phased out.  The carrying value of the DelStar trade name has been reclassified from Unamortized Intangible Assets to Amortized Intangible assets in the table above as of December 31, 2016. The following table shows the estimated aggregate amortization expense for the next five years ($ in millions): For the year ended December 31, Estimated Amortization Expense 2018 $ 20.7   2019 20.6   2020 20.3   2021 20.3   2022 20.2 86 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Other Assets Other assets consisted of the following ($ in millions): December 31,   2017   2016 Capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization $ 7.4     $ 4.4   Business tax credits, including VAT and ICMS (net of $10.6 million and $11.5 million reserve as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) 2.4     2.5   Grantor trust assets 12.2     10.3   Net pension assets 4.6      -    Long-term supplies inventory 7.0     6.0   Other assets 5.9     4.3   Total $ 39.5     $ 27.5 The Company's ICMS credits in Brazil are fully reserved. These credits do not expire. The Company is still exploring other actions to utilize the credits. Charges and credits associated with normal ongoing activity are included in Cost of Products Sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Future material changes as a result of new legislation or a change in our operations will be reported separately. Grantor trust assets consist primarily of cash surrender values in Company-owned life insurance policies held by a trust to be used for the eventual payment of employee deferred compensation.  These assets are restricted from Company use until all obligations are satisfied. Note 12. Restructuring and Impairment Activities The Company incurred restructuring and impairment expenses of $8.1 million, $25.6 million and $14.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company incurred $2.7 million, $21.3 million and reversed $0.2 million in restructuring and impairment expenses during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, within the AMS segment.  Restructuring and impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of $2.6 million in severance accruals for employees at our U.S. and Belgium manufacturing operations, as well as $0.1 million in impairment charges at one of our U.S. manufacturing facilities. During 2016, $20.7 million of the expense in the AMS segment was attributable to the impairment of the DelStar trade name, as discussed in Note 10. Intangible Assets.  The remaining amount in 2016 and the total expense in 2015 related to accruals for severance incurred during the acquisition of the assets from Smith & Nephew in December 2014. In the EP segment, restructuring and impairment expenses were $5.3 million, $4.0 million and $14.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2017, restructuring and impairment expenses in the EP segment consisted of $0.8 million in severance accruals for employees at our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and France, as well as an impairment charge of $4.0 million at our Philippines RTL location, and impairment charges totaling $0.5 million at our French and United States manufacturing facilities. In 2016, restructuring and impairment expenses in the EP segment consisted of $3.4 million related to severance expenses in the French, Brazilian and U.S. operations for ongoing accruals over the remaining service lives of affected employees related to previously announced actions as well as $0.6 million of impairment charges to certain of the Company's manufacturing equipment in Poland and Brazil. In 2015, restructuring and impairment expenses in the EP segment consisted of $7.8 million related to severance expenses in the French, Brazilian and U.S. operations for ongoing accruals over the remaining service lives of affected 87 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS employees related to previously announced actions as well as $1.4 million of impairment charges to certain of the Company's Polish and Brazilian manufacturing equipment and $5.2 million of loss recognized to adjust the recorded value of equipment at the Philippines RTL location to its estimated fair value less cost to sell as discussed in more detail below.  The fair value of the RTL Philippines facility was determined by using independent appraisals of certain assets, which are considered significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs. Additionally, the Company incurred $0.1 million, $0.3 million, and $0.4 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, in restructuring expenses related to accruals for severance expenses within supporting overhead departments which were not allocated to a specific segment. Restructuring liabilities were classified within Accrued expenses in each of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.  Changes in the restructuring liabilities, substantially all of which are employee-related, are summarized as follows ($ in millions): 2017   2016 Balance at beginning of year $ 4.3     $ 7.7   Accruals for announced programs 3.5     4.3   Cash payments (6.4 )   (8.4 ) Exchange rate impacts 0.3     0.7   Balance at end of period $ 1.7     $ 4.3 Long-lived assets to be sold are classified as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the assets; the asset are available for immediate sale in present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets have been initiated; the sale of the assets is probable, and transfer of the assets is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the assets beyond one year; the assets are being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. A long-lived asset that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset until the date of sale. The fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any reduction in fair value is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset. Upon being classified as held for sale, depreciation is ceased. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are continued to be depreciated. Upon determining that a long-lived asset meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the assets and liabilities of the disposal group, if material, are reported in the line item ""Assets held for sale"" in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. In early 2015, the Company made the decision to dispose of the Company's mothballed RTL facility and related equipment in the Philippines.  These assets are included in the EP segment.  During 2015, the Company reclassified the equipment at this location, along with the land and building associated with the property, from Property, plant and equipment, net, to Assets held for sale on the consolidating balance sheets. The reclassifications were made for all assets that are expected to be sold within one year of the balance sheet date and, as of December 31, 2015, all of the physical assets of this entity were classified as Assets held for sale. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred $5.2 million in impairment expense to write-down the carrying value of these assets to the net realizable value.  Additional impairment charges of $4.0 million were recognized on these assets during the year ended December 31, 2017.  There were no impairment charges related to these assets recorded during 2016. 88 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 13.

Under the terms of the First Amendment, and effective upon the closing of the Conwed acquisition on January 20, 2017, the Company's maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined in the First Amendment, calculated on a trailing four fiscal quarter basis, is required to be not greater than 4.25 at December 31, 2017, reducing to 4.00 after December 31, 2017, 3.75 after March 31, 2018, 3.50 after June 30, 2018 and 3.00 after December 31, 2018. On October 28, 2015 Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the Amended Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $1 billion, consisting of a $650 million revolving credit facility, or Revolving Credit Facility available to the Company; a $100 million Term Loan A-1 (""Term Loan A-1"") made to the Company; and a $250 million Term Loan A-2 (""Term Loan A-2"" and, together with Term Loan A-1, the ""Term Loans"") made to the Company. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on October 28, 2020. The Term Loan A-1 amortizes at the rate of 5.0% for the first two years, at the rate of 10.0% for the final three years and matures on October 28, 2020. The Term Loan A-2 amortizes at the rate of 1.0% per year and matures on October 28, 2022. The Term Loans are generally subject to mandatory repayment out of the net cash proceeds of asset sales which are not reinvested in operating assets. The credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries.  In December 2015, the Company prepaid the full amount of amortization for Term Loan A-1, which totaled $40 million. The interest rate margins applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to either, at the Company's option, (i) a base rate, plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 0.25% to 1.50%, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A-1, and from 0.50% to 1.75%, in the case of Term Loan A-2, or (ii) an adjusted London interbank offered rate (adjusted for maximum reserves) (""LIBOR""), plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.25% to 2.50%, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A-1, and from 1.50% to 2.75%, in the case of Term Loan A-2.  The applicable margin, in each case, is adjusted from time to time based on the Company's ratio of net debt to EBITDA as defined by the Amended Credit Agreement.  As of December 31, 2017, the average applicable interest rate on Amended Credit Agreement borrowings was 3.60% on US Revolving Credit Facility borrowings, 2.00% on Euro Revolving Credit Facility borrowings, 3.63% on Term Loan A-1 borrowings and 3.88% on Term Loan A-2 borrowings. 89 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Amended Credit Agreement also contains representations and warranties which are customary for facilities of this type. The Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement at December 31, 2017. French Employee Profit Sharing At both December 31, 2017 and 2016, long-term debt other than the Amended Credit Agreement primarily consisted of obligations of the French operations related to government-mandated profit sharing. Each year, representatives of the workers at each of the French businesses can make an election for the profit sharing amounts from the most recent year ended to be invested in a financial institution or with their respective employer. To the extent that funds are invested with the Company, these amounts bear interest at 1.15% and 0.80% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are generally payable in the fifth year subsequent to the year in which the profit sharing is accrued. Bank Overdrafts The Company also had bank overdraft facilities of $20.0 million and $27.3 million, at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which none was outstanding at either December 31, 2017 or 2016.  Interest is incurred on outstanding amounts at market rates and was 0.24% and 0.14%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 2016. No commitment fees are paid on the unused portion of these facilities. Rate Swap Agreements The Company maintained a forward interest rate swap agreement on a portion of its long-term debt as of December 31, 2017 that will fix the LIBOR rate on $50.0 million of the Company's variable-rate long-term debt as of October 2014 at a predetermined rate plus a credit spread through the end of October 2018. See Note 14. Derivatives for more information. On January 20, 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a major financial institution for a three-year term on a notional amount of $315 million. The interest rate swap is intended to manage the Company's interest rate risk by fixing the interest rate on a portion of the Company's debt currently outstanding under its credit facility that was previously subject to a floating interest rate equal to 1-month LIBOR plus a credit spread. The swap provides for the Company to pay a fixed rate of 1.65% per annum in addition to the credit spread on such portion of its outstanding debt in exchange for receiving a variable interest rate based on 1-month LIBOR. On January 20, 2017, the Company also entered into a three-year cross-currency swap with a major financial institution designated as a hedge of a portion of the Company's net investment in certain Euro-denominated subsidiaries.  The terms of the cross-currency swap provide for an exchange of principal on a notional amount of $100 million swapped to 93.7 million at maturity.  The Company will receive from our swap counterparty U.S. dollar interest at a fixed rate of 1.65% per annum and pay to our swap counterparty Euro interest at a fixed rate of -0.18% per annum. 90 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Principal Repayments Under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company selects an ""interest period"" for each of its borrowings from the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company can repay such borrowings and borrow again at a subsequent date if it chooses to do so, providing it flexibility and efficient use of any excess cash. The Company currently has the intent and ability to allow its debt balances to remain outstanding and expects to continue to file notices of continuation related to its borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017 such that those amounts are not expected to be repaid prior to the December 2020 expiration of the Revolving Credit Facility. Following are the expected maturities for the Company's debt obligations as of December 31, 2017 ($ in millions): 2018 $ 6.9   2019 5.2   2020 434.6   2021 4.4   2022 236.0   Thereafter 2.9   Total $ 690.0 Fair Value of Debt At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the estimated fair values of the Company's current and long-term debt approximated the respective carrying amounts, as the interest rates were variable and based on current market indices. Debt Issuance Costs In conjunction with the First Amendment, the Company capitalized approximately $0.6 million in deferred debt issuance costs which will be amortized over the term of the related debt instruments. In conjunction with the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company capitalized approximately $7.4 million, in the fourth quarter of 2015, in deferred debt issuance costs associated with the new facility which will be amortized over the term of the related debt instruments.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's total deferred debt issuance costs totaled $5.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Amortization expense of $1.8 million and $1.7 million was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and has been included as a component of Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  Following is the expected future amortization of the Company's deferred debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2017 ($ in millions): 2018 $ 1.8   2019 1.8   2020 1.6   2021 0.3   2022 0.3   Total $ 5.8 91 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 14. Derivatives In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk on its variable-rate debt. To manage these risks, the Company utilizes a variety of practices including, where considered appropriate, derivative instruments. The Company has no derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes or any derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features. All derivative instruments used by the Company are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties. The fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are determined using observable inputs and are considered Level 2 assets or liabilities. The Company utilizes currency forward, swap and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to selectively hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk when it is practical and economical to do so. The use of these contracts minimizes transactional exposure to exchange rate changes.  We designate certain of our foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For foreign exchange contracts not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the contracts' fair value are recorded to net income each period. The Company selectively hedges its exposure to interest rate increases on variable-rate, long-term debt when it is practical and economical to do so. Changes in the fair value of interest rate contracts considered cash flow hedges are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.

The terms of the cross-currency swap provide for an exchange of principal on a notional amount of $100 million swapped to 93.7 million at maturity.  The Company will receive from our swap counterparty U.S. dollar interest at a fixed rate of 1.65% per annum and pay to our swap counterparty Euro interest at a fixed rate of -0.18% per annum.

Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. On December 22, 2017, the SEC 94 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date.  In accordance with SAB 118, we have determined certain provisional amounts and reasonable estimates at December 31, 2017. The impact of the Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we have determined the provisional amounts and reasonable estimates of the transition tax and deferred tax remeasurement at December 31, 2017. The impact of the Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Act. We will complete our analysis over this measurement period ending December 22, 2018 and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net earnings from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined. The Company has not accounted for the tax impacts related to state taxes, the Global Intangible Low Tax Income, Base Erosion Anti Abuse Tax or Foreign Derived Intangible Income regimes or any of the other provisions of the Tax Legislation that are not effective until fiscal year 2018.  Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete. We previously considered the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no deferred income taxes. Prior to the Transition Tax, we had an excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, including undistributed foreign earnings. While the Transition Tax resulted in the reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, an actual repatriation from our non-U.S. subsidiaries could still be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. We have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation and have provisionally determined that we will not be repatriating any previously deemed indefinitely reinvested earnings. 95 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) were comprised of the following ($ in millions): December 31,   2017   2016 Deferred Tax Assets       Receivable allowances $ 0.4     $ 0.2   Reserves and accruals 3.8     3.9   Inventory and other assets 0.7     2.3   Postretirement and other employee benefits 15.9     20.0   Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 94.1     104.8   Intangibles 73.6     76.6   Other 4.7     0.1     193.2     207.9   Less: Valuation allowance (182.5 )   (194.8 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 10.7     $ 13.1           Deferred Tax Liabilities       Net fixed assets $ (40.5 )   $ (34.4 ) Investment in subsidiaries (9.8 )   (4.1 ) Derivatives (1.3 )    -    Other (0.4 )   (0.7 ) Net deferred income tax liabilities $ (52.0 )   $ (39.2 )         Total net deferred income tax liabilities $ (41.3 )   $ (26.1 ) As of December 31, 2017 the Company had approximately $92.8 million of tax affected operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income in various jurisdictions which will expire on various dates as follows: 2017 2018-2022 $ 3.4   2023-2034 12.7   Indefinite 76.7     92.8 In addition, the Company has $1.3 million of state tax credits that will expire between 2018 - 2036. The Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards for certain entities. The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, in Luxembourg, Spain and the Philippines total $166.3 million, $9.1 million and $2.7 million respectively, fully reserving the net deferred tax asset balances in these locations.  In addition, there is a valuation allowance on a tax credit receivable of $3.4 million in Brazil.  We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state tax attributes will not be realized.  In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $1.0 million on the related deferred tax assets. The Company's assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the valuation of these net deferred tax assets take into account available positive and negative evidence of realizability, including recent financial performance, the ability to realize benefits of restructuring and other recent actions, projections of the amount and category of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Actual future operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future periods could differ from the Company's current assumptions, judgments and estimates. The Company believes 96 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets. The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company's unrecognized tax benefits related to income taxes ($ in millions): December 31,   2017   2016   2015 Uncertain tax position balance at beginning of year $ 2.4     $ 0.9     $ 1.8   Increases related to current year tax positions 0.3     2.0      -    Increases related to prior year tax positions 0.4      -       -    Decreases related to prior year tax positions (2.0 )    -       -    Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations (0.1 )   (0.5 )   (0.9 ) Uncertain tax position balance at end of year $ 1.0     $ 2.4     $ 0.9 The liability for unrecognized tax benefits included $1.1 million as of December 31, 2017 that if recognized would impact the Company's effective tax rate.  We believe that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to approximately $0.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2018 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations and other regulatory filings.  The Company's policy with respect to penalties and interest in connection with income tax assessments or related to unrecognized tax benefits is to classify penalties as provision for income taxes and interest as interest expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no material income tax penalties or interest accrued during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions. Currently, the company is under U.S. audit for tax years 2014 and 2015.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 17. Postretirement and Other Benefits North American Pension and Postretirement Healthcare and Life Insurance Benefits The U.S. operations have defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain full-time employees. Retirement benefits are based on either a cash balance benefit formula or a final average pay formula for certain employees who were ""grandfathered"" and retained retirement benefits under the terms of the plan prior to its amendment to include a cash balance benefit formula.  Benefits related to the U.S. defined benefit and pension plan are frozen for all employees. The U.S. operations also have unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans, or OPEB plans, which cover certain of its retirees through age 65. Some employees who retained benefits under the terms of the Company's plans prior to certain past amendments receive retiree healthcare coverage at rates subsidized by the Company. For other eligible employees, retiree healthcare coverage access is offered at full cost to the retiree. The postretirement healthcare plans include a limit on the Company's share of costs for current and future retirees. The U.S. operations' retiree life insurance plans are noncontributory. The Company's Canadian postretirement benefits liability is immaterial and therefore is not included in these disclosures. French Pension Benefits In France, employees are covered under a government-administered program. In addition, the Company's French operations sponsor retirement indemnity plans, which pay a lump sum retirement benefit to all of its permanent employees who retire. In addition, the Company's French operations sponsor a supplemental executive pension plan. Plan assets are principally invested in the general asset portfolio of a French insurance company. 98 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC.

The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations. The discount rate fluctuates from year to year based on current market interest rates for high-quality, fixed-income investments. The Company also evaluates the expected average duration of its pension obligations in determining its discount rate. An assumed long-term rate of compensation increase is also used to determine the PBO. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Pension Benefits   OPEB Benefits   United States   France   United States   2017   2016   2017   2016   2017   2016 Discount rate 3.60 %   4.11 %   1.14 %   1.12 %   3.59 %   4.09 % Rate of compensation increase  -  %    -  %   1.75 %   1.90 %   3.50 %   3.50 % The U.S. postretirement healthcare plan provides for benefits to be limited to a cost ceiling which has already been reached.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company's investment strategy with respect to its U.S. pension plan assets is to maximize the return on investment of plan assets at an acceptable level of risk and to assure the plans' fiscal health. The target asset allocation varies based on the funded status of the plan in an effort to match the duration of the plan's liabilities to investments in long duration fixed income assets over time. The Company's investments under the French pension plans are primarily invested as directed by governmental authorities, their contracted providers or the participants without direction from the Company. The primary goal of the Company's pension plans is to maintain the highest probability of assuring future benefit payments to participants while providing growth of capital in real terms. To achieve this goal, the investment philosophy is to protect plan assets from large investment losses, particularly over time, while steadily growing the assets in a prudent manner. While there cannot be complete assurance that the objectives will be realized, the Company believes that the likelihood of realizing the objectives are reasonable based upon this investment philosophy. The Company has an investment committee that meets on a periodic basis to review the portfolio returns and to determine asset mix targets. The U.S. and French pension plans' asset target allocations by asset category for 2018 and actual allocations by asset category at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: United States   France   2018 Target   2017   2016   2017   2016 Asset Category                   Cash and cash equivalents 1 %   1 %   1 %   38 %   24 % Equity securities*                   Domestic large cap 7     7     7     31     20   Domestic small cap 4     4     5      -       -    International 20     20     20      -       -    Fixed income securities 68     68     67     28     54   Alternative investments**  -       -       -      3     2   Total 100 %   100 %   100 %   100 %   100 % * None of the Company's pension plan assets are targeted for investment in SWM stock, except that it is possible that one or more mutual funds held by the plan could hold shares of SWM. ** Investments in this category under the U.S. pension plan only may include hedge funds, and may include real estate under the French pension plan. 102 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company's pension assets are classified according to an established fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). A financial instrument's level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; Level 2  Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; Level 3  Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

Other Foreign Pension Benefits In Brazil, Poland and the United Kingdom, employees are covered under government-administered programs. In Canada, the employee pension benefits are not significant and therefore are not included in the above disclosures. Other Benefits We sponsor a qualified defined contribution plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the plan, the Company matches a portion of employee contributions. The Company's cost under the plan was $3.6 million, $2.5 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company provides U.S. executives, certain other key personnel and its directors the opportunity to participate in deferred compensation plans. Participating employees can elect to defer a portion of their salaries and certain other compensation. Participating directors can elect to defer their meeting fees, as a cash deferral, as well as their quarterly retainer fees, as deferred stock unit credits. The Company's liability balance under these deferred compensation plans totaled $17.4 million and $15.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other liabilities. In connection with these plans, the Company has a grantor trust into 104 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS which it has contributed funds toward its future obligations under the various plans (See Note 11. Other Assets). The balance of grantor trust assets totaled $12.2 million and $10.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These assets are restricted from Company use until all obligations are satisfied. In accordance with French law, certain salaried employees in France may accumulate unused regular vacation and supplemental hours of paid leave that can be credited to an individual's Compte Epargne Temps, or CET. The CET account may grow over an individual's career and the hours accumulated may be withdrawn upon retirement or under other special circumstances at the individual's then current rate of pay. The balance of the Company's liability for this program reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other liabilities was $5.6 million and $5.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Note 18. Stockholders' Equity Restricted Stock Plan In April 2015, the Company adopted a new 2015 Long-term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, which replaced its existing Restricted Stock Plan (""RSP""). The LTIP is intended to promote the Company's long-term financial success by attracting and retaining outstanding executive personnel and to motivate such personnel by means of equity grants. The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors selects participants and establishes the terms of any grant of restricted stock. The Company's LTIP provides that issuance of restricted stock immediately transfers ownership rights in shares of its Common Stock to the recipient of the grant, including the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends thereon.  Other types of stock awards are available under the LTIP, but not currently used. The recipient's continued ownership of and right to freely transfer the restricted stock is subject to such conditions on transferability and to such risks of forfeiture as are established by the Compensation Committee at the time of the grant, which may include continued employment with the Company for a defined period, achievement of specified management performance objectives or other conditions established by the Compensation Committee.   The number of shares which may be issued under the LTIP is limited to 5,000,000. Restricted shares outstanding under the RSP will continue to vest in accordance with the terms of each grant, however, no further grants of shares will be issued under the RSP.  No single participant may be awarded, in the aggregate, more than 750,000 shares during any fiscal year. As of December 31, 2017, 1,584,454 restricted shares had been issued under the Company's restricted stock plans of which 283,338 shares of issued restricted stock were not yet vested and for which $2.0 million in unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years.

During 2016, the Company recognized $2.8 million for 167,961 shares earned under the 2016-2017 award opportunity and $1.5 million of compensation expense earned under the 2015-2016 award opportunity.  During 2015, the Company recognized $1.8 million of compensation expense for 71,228 shares earned under the 2015-2016 award opportunity and $0.6 million of compensation expense earned under the 2014-2015 award opportunity. Basic and Diluted Shares Reconciliation The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share. The Company has granted restricted stock that contains nonforfeitable rights to dividends on unvested shares. Since these unvested shares are considered participating securities under the two-class method, the Company allocates earnings per share to common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Diluted net income per common share is computed based on net income divided by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding. Potential common shares during the respective periods are those related to dilutive stock-based compensation, including long-term share-based incentive compensation, stock options outstanding, and directors' accumulated deferred stock compensation which may be received by the directors in the form of stock or cash. A reconciliation of the average number of common and potential common shares outstanding used in the calculations of basic and diluted net income per share follows ($ in millions, shares in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31,    2017   2016   2015 Numerator (basic and diluted):           Net income $ 34.5     $ 82.8     $ 89.7   Less: Dividends paid to participating securities (0.4 )   (0.3 )   (0.2 ) Less: Undistributed earnings available to participating securities  -      (0.2 )   (0.3 ) Undistributed and distributed earnings available to common stockholders $ 34.1     $ 82.3     $ 89.2               Denominator:           Average number of common shares outstanding 30,407.1     30,310.9     30,251.4   Effect of dilutive stock-based compensation 142.2     152.5     122.9   Average number of common and potential common shares outstanding 30,549.3     30,463.4     30,374.3 106 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Other Commitments The EP segment's PDM Industries plant has a minimum annual commitment of approximately $1.6 million per year for calcium carbonate purchases, a raw material used in the manufacturing of some paper products, which totals approximately $10.9 million through 2024.  Future purchases are expected to be at levels that exceed such minimum levels under these contracts. The Company enters into certain other immaterial contracts from time to time for the purchase of certain raw materials. The Company also enters into certain contracts for the purchase of equipment and related costs in connection with its ongoing capital projects. The Company has agreements with an energy co-generation supplier in France whereby the supplier constructed and operates a co-generation facility at certain plants and supplies steam that is used in the operation of these plants. The Company is committed to purchasing minimum annual amounts of steam generated by these facilities under the agreements through 2020. These minimum annual commitments total approximately $1.6 million. The Company's current and expected requirements for steam at these facilities are at levels that exceed the minimum levels under the contracts. The EP segment's Brazilian plant, SWM-B, has an agreement for the transmission and distribution of energy that covers all of the plant's consumption of electrical energy valued at approximately $3.4 million annually through 2020. The French plants have contracts for natural gas to be distributed to and consumed at PdM, LTRI and St. Girons. The value of the natural gas and distribution to be provided under these contracts is estimated at approximately $3.0 million in 2018.  The Spay, France plant has a contract to consume biomass at approximately $2.1 million for each of the next two years. The Company has certain other letters of credit, guarantees and surety bonds outstanding at December 31, 2017, which are not material either individually or in the aggregate. 107 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Litigation Brazil Imposto sobre Circulao de Mercadorias e Servios, or ICMS, a form of value-added tax in Brazil, was assessed to our Brazilian subsidiary Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil Indstria e Comrcio de Papel Ltda. (""SWM-B"") in December of 2000.   SWM-B received two assessments from the tax authorities of the State of Rio de Janeiro for unpaid ICMS taxes on certain raw materials from January 1995 through November 2000, collectively the Raw Materials Assessment. The Raw Materials Assessments concerned the accrual and use by SWM-B of ICMS tax credits generated from the production and sale of certain non-tobacco related grades of paper sold domestically. SWM-B has contested the Raw Materials Assessments based on Article 150, VI of the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988, which grants immunity from ICMS taxes to papers intended for printing books, newspapers and periodicals, or immune papers, and thus to the raw material inputs used to produce immune papers. One of the two assessments, or Assessment 1 (case number 2001.001.115144-5), related in part to tax periods that predated our acquisition of the Pirahy plant in Pirai, Brazil.  In October 2015, the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil denied the State's appeal of Assessment 1, in the amount of approximately $16 million, a decision which is now final.  The second assessment, or Assessment 2 (case number 2001.001.064544-6), pertains exclusively to periods that SWM-B owned the Pirahy plant.  Assessment 2 in the amount of approximately $13 million remains pending before the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil on SWM-B's appeal on the merits and is likely to be finally decided by the action of the chamber of the court hearing the matter.  No docket entry has been made yet regarding argument on Assessment 2. SWM-B received assessments from the tax authorities of the State of Rio de Janeiro for unpaid ICMS and Fundo Estadual de Combate  Pobreza (""FECP"", a value-added tax similar to ICMS) taxes on interstate purchases of electricity.  The state issued three sets of assessments against SWM-B, one for May 2006 - November 2007, a second for January 2008 - December 2010, and a third for September 2011 - September 2013 (collectively the ""Electricity Assessments"").  SWM-B has challenged all three Electricity Assessments in administrative proceedings before the state tax council (in the first-level court Junta de Reviso Fiscal and the appellate court Conselho de Contribuintes) based on Resolution 1.610/89, which defers these taxes on electricity purchased by an ""electricity-intensive consumer.""  In October and November 2014, a majority of the Conselho de Contribuintes sitting en banc ruled against SWM-B in each of the first and second electricity assessments. The State issued notices to SWM-B to pay approximately $6 million in connection with the first electricity assessment and $9 million in connection with the second electricity assessment, in each case based on the foreign currency exchange rate at December 31, 2017.  SWM-B filed separate challenges to these electricity assessments in further court proceedings in the state judicial system, and different chambers of the judicial court granted SWM-B preliminary injunctions against enforcement. In March and July 2017, the first-level judicial court ruled that SWM-B must present additional evidence that it is an ""electricity-intensive consumer"" concerning the first and second electricity assessments. SWM-B is now pursuing these actions. SWM-B's challenge to the third electricity assessment (approximately $4 million as of December 31, 2017) was decided adversely to SWM-B at the first administrative level (Junta de Reviso Fiscal) and has been appealed to the Conselho de Contribuintes. The State issued a new regulation effective January 1, 2018 that only specific industries are ""electricity-intensive consumers,"" a list that excludes paper manufacturers. SWM-B believes that both the remaining Raw Materials Assessment and the Electricity Assessments will ultimately be resolved in its favor.  No liability has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements for these assessments based on our evaluation of these matters under the facts and law as presently understood. The Company can give no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such proceedings. France In December 2016, the Conseil de Prud'hommes d'Orange (a French court dealing with labor matters) rendered a decision by which the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Schweitzer Mauduit France (""SWM France""), was ordered to pay approximately 1.3 million to 18 former employees of Malaucne Industries, another wholly owned subsidiary, on the grounds, among other things, that SWM France was a ""co-employer"" of the plaintiffs, and, as a result, liable for certain obligations of Malaucne Industries with respect to such employees.  Malaucne Industries stopped production 108 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in 2009.  The Company believes that SWM France, which is a corporate holding company and indirect corporate parent of Malaucne Industries, is not a ""co-employer"" of any person and that the other claims are also without merit.  The Company has no liability recorded in the consolidated financial statements for this matter, believing that the chances of SWM France to reverse the decision on appeal are sufficient that no such reserve is warranted.  There can be no assurance, however, that the court of appeals will decide in favor of SWM France on any of the questions pending before the court. Environmental Matters The Company's operations are subject to various nations' federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to environmental matters. The nature of the Company's operations exposes it to the risk of claims with respect to various environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. While the Company has incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, it believes that its future cost of compliance with environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and its exposure to liability for environmental claims and its obligation to participate in the remediation and monitoring of certain hazardous waste disposal sites, will not have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or unknown contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by the Company (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs which could have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. The Company incurs spending necessary to meet legal requirements and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment at its facilities in the United States, France, Poland, Brazil, China and Canada. For these purposes, the Company incurred total capital expenditures of $1.1 million in 2017, and expects to incur less than $1.0 million in each of 2018 and 2019, of which no material amount is the result of environmental fines or settlements. The foregoing capital expenditures are not expected to reduce the Company's ability to invest in other appropriate and necessary capital projects and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Indemnification Matters In connection with its spin-off from Kimberly-Clark in 1995, the Company undertook to indemnify and hold Kimberly-Clark harmless from claims and liabilities related to the businesses transferred to it that were not identified as excluded liabilities in the related agreements. As of December 31, 2017, there are no claims pending under this indemnification that the Company deems to be material. General Matters In the ordinary course of conducting business activities, the Company and its subsidiaries become involved in certain other judicial, administrative and regulatory proceedings involving both private parties and governmental authorities. These proceedings include insured and uninsured regulatory, employment, intellectual property, general and commercial liability, environmental and other matters. At this time, the Company does not expect any of these proceedings to have a material effect on its reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company can give no assurance that the results of any such proceedings will not materially affect its reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 109 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Atlanta, Georgia March 1, 2018 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1995. 115","Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"")) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time frames specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of December 31, 2017, was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer.  Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Co-Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, is designed to provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on the Company's evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.  As of December 31, 2017, we had no material weaknesses based on our tests using the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013).  Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. The SEC's general guidance permits the exclusion of an assessment of the effectiveness of a registrant's controls and procedures as they relate to its internal control over financial reporting for an acquired business during the first year following such acquisition if, among other circumstances and factors, there is not an adequate amount of time between the acquisition date and the date of assessment.  In January 2017, we acquired Conwed Plastics LLC which was treated as a business combination in accordance with guidance provided by ASC 805.  In accordance with the SEC guidance, the scope of our evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 did not include the internal control over financial reporting of these acquired operations.  Assets acquired in these transactions represented 17.6% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2017 and net sales generated by the acquired operations represented 14.4% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017.  From the acquisition date to December 31, 2017, the processes and systems of the acquired operations did not significantly impact our internal control over financial reporting. 116 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000623/0001000623-18-000044-index.html"
