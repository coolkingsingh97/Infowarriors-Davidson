Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2017, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Nicholas Financial, Inc. (including its subsidiaries, the ""Company"") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP"") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended in Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to ensure the information is not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2018. It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2017 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 14, 2017. The March 31, 2017 consolidated balance sheet included herein has been derived from the March 31, 2017 audited consolidated balance sheet included in the aforementioned Form 10-K. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables and the fair value of interest rate swap agreements. 2. Revenue Recognition Finance receivables consist of automobile finance installment contracts (""Contracts"") and direct consumer loans (""Direct Loans""). Interest income on finance receivables is recognized using the interest method. Accrual of interest income on finance receivables is suspended when a loan enters bankruptcy status, is contractually delinquent for 61 days or more or the collateral is repossessed, whichever is earlier. Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts are accounted for under the cost-recovery method. Interest income on Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts does not resume until all principal amounts are recovered (see Note 4). A dealer discount represents the difference between the finance receivable, net of unearned interest, of a Contract, and the amount of money the Company actually pays for the Contract. The discount negotiated by the Company is a function of the lender, the wholesale value of the vehicle and competition in any given market. In making decisions regarding the purchase of a particular Contract the Company considers the following factors related to the borrower: place and length of residence; current and prior job status; history in making installment payments for automobiles; current income; and credit history. In addition, the Company examines its prior experience with Contracts purchased from the dealer from which the Company is purchasing the Contract, and the value of the automobile in relation to the purchase price and the term of the Contract. The entire amount of discount is amortized as an adjustment to yield using the interest method over the life of the loan. The average dealer discount associated with new volume for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 6.89% and 6.87%, respectively in relation to the total amount financed. The average dealer discount associated with new volume for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 7.23% and 7.00%, respectively. The amount of future unearned income is computed as the product of the Contract rate, the Contract term and the Contract amount. Deferred revenues consist primarily of commissions received from the sale of ancillary products. These products include automobile warranties, roadside assistance programs, accident and health insurance, credit life insurance, involuntary unemployment insurance coverage, and forced placed automobile insurance. These commissions are amortized over the life of the contract using the interest method. 5 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 3. Earnings (Loss) Per Share The Company has granted stock compensation awards with nonforfeitable dividend rights which are considered participating securities. Earnings (loss) per share is calculated using the two-class method, as such awards are more dilutive under this method than the treasury stock method. Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, which excludes the participating securities. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares from stock compensation awards. Earnings (loss) per share have been computed based on the following weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Three months ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share amounts)      Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share amounts)       2017      2016      2017      2016   Numerator:                         Net income (loss)    $ (2,898 )     $ 1,606      $ (1,741 )     $ 6,479   Less: Allocation of earnings (loss) to participating securities      40        (22 )       23        (76 )                                              Net income (loss) allocated to common stock      (2,858 )       1,584        (1,718 )       6,403                                               Basic earnings (loss) per share computation:                         Net income (loss) allocated to common stock    $ (2,858 )     $ 1,584      $ (1,718 )     $ 6,403                                               Weighted average common shares outstanding, including shares considered participating securities      7,910        7,697        7,876        7,763   Less: Weighted average participating securities outstanding      (110 )       (107 )       (102 )       (91 )                                              Weighted average shares of common stock      7,800        7,590        7,774        7,672                                               Basic earnings (loss) per share    $ (0.37 )     $ 0.21      $ (0.22 )     $ 0.83                                               Diluted earnings (loss) per share computation:                         Net income (loss) allocated to common stock    $ (2,858 )     $ 1,584      $ (1,718 )     $ 6,403   Undistributed earnings re-allocated to participating securities       -             -            -             -                                                  Numerator for diluted earnings (loss) per share    $ (2,858 )     $ 1,584      $ (1,718 )     $ 6,403   Weighted average common shares outstanding for basic earnings (loss) per share      7,800        7,590        7,774        7,672   Incremental shares from stock options       -            60         -            60                                               Weighted average shares and dilutive potential common shares      7,800        7,650        7,774        7,732                                               Diluted earnings (loss) per share    $ (0.37 )     $ 0.21      $ (0.22 )     $ 0.83 Diluted earnings (loss) per share do not include the effect of certain stock options as their impact would be anti-dilutive. The potential shares of common stock from stock options totaling 189,690 were excluded from the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation for December 31, 2017 because the Company experienced a net loss for the period. The potential shares of common stock from stock options totaling 160,000 were excluded from the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation for December 31, 2016 because their effect is anti-dilutive. 6 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 4.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on Contracts: Three months ended December 31, (In thousands)      Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands)       2017      2016      2017     2016   Balance at beginning of period    $ 19,967      $ 12,925      $ 16,885     $ 12,265   Current period provision      8,818        8,701        28,498       23,723   Losses absorbed      (8,745 )       (8,247 )       (26,372 )      (23,815 )  Recoveries      360        570        1,389       1,776                                              Balance at end of period    $ 20,400      $ 13,949      $ 20,400     $ 13,949 The allowance for credit losses is increased by charges against earnings and decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries). The Company aggregates Contracts into static pools consisting of Contracts purchased during a three-month period for each branch location as management considers these pools to have similar risk characteristics and are considered smaller-balance homogenous loans. The Company analyzes each consolidated static pool at specific points in time to estimate losses that are probable of being incurred as of the reporting date. It has maintained historical write-off information for over 10 years with respect to every consolidated static pool and segregates each static pool by liquidation which creates 7 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 4. Finance Receivables (continued) snapshots or buckets of each pool's historical write-off to liquidation ratio at five different points in each vintage pool's liquidation cycle. These snapshots are then used to assist in determining the allowance for credit losses. The five snapshots are tracked at liquidation levels of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%. These snapshots help us in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses. The Company purchases Contracts from automobile dealers at a negotiated price that is less than the original principal amount being financed by the purchaser of the automobile. The Contracts are predominately for used vehicles. As of December 31, 2017, the average model year of vehicles collateralizing the portfolio was a 2010 vehicle. The Company utilizes a static pool approach to track portfolio performance. If the allowance for credit losses is determined to be inadequate for a static pool, then an additional charge to income through the provision is used to maintain adequate reserves based on management's evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, the composition of the portfolio, and current economic conditions. Such evaluation, considers among other matters, the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, management's estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance for credit losses. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on Direct Loans: Three months ended December 31, (In thousands)      Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands)       2017      2016      2017     2016   Balance at beginning of period    $ 782      $ 774      $ 773     $ 748   Current period provision      171        95        389       243   Losses absorbed      (172 )       (73 )       (395 )      (217 )  Recoveries      6        3        20       25                                              Balance at end of period    $ 787      $ 799      $ 787     $ 799 Direct Loans are typically for amounts ranging from $1,000 to $11,000 and are generally secured by a lien on an automobile, watercraft or other permissible tangible personal property. Much of Direct Loans are originated with current or former customers under the Company's automobile financing program. The typical Direct Loan represents a better credit risk than Contracts due to the customer's historical payment history with the Company; however, the underlying collateral is less valuable. In deciding if to make a loan, the Company considers the individual's credit history, job stability, income and impressions created during a personal interview with a Company loan officer. Additionally, because most of the Direct Loans made by the Company to date have been made to borrowers under Contracts previously purchased by the Company, the payment history of the borrower under the Contract is a significant factor in making the loan decision. As of December 31, 2017, loans made by the Company pursuant to its Direct Loan program constituted approximately 2% of the aggregate principal amount of the Company's loan portfolio. Changes in the allowance for credit losses for both Contracts and Direct Loans were driven by current economic conditions and credit loss trends over several reporting periods which are utilized in estimating future losses and overall portfolio performance. A performing account is defined as an account that is less than 61 days past due. We define an automobile contract as delinquent when more than 25% of a payment contractually due by a certain date has not been paid by the immediately following due date, which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements or as a result of a deferral. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due, as extended where applicable. In certain circumstances, we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions. The only modification of terms in those circumstances is to advance the obligor's next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable. There are no other concessions, such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. 8 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 4.

When an account is 180 days contractually delinquent, the account is written off. The delinquency table below represents both performing and non-performing accounts; however, it does not include Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts. Upon notification of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the account is not modified to reflect the new repayment plan administered by a court-appointed trustee. The cost recovery method of accounting is used, and the accrual of interest income is suspended. The balance will be reduced as payments are received by the bankruptcy court. In the event the debtors' balance has been reduced by the bankruptcy court, the Company will record a loss equal to the amount of principal balance reduction. In the event an account is dismissed from bankruptcy, the Company will decide, based on several factors, to begin repossession proceedings or to allow the customer to begin making regularly scheduled payments. The following tables present certain information regarding the delinquency rates experienced by the Company with respect to Contracts and under its Direct Loans, excluding Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts: (In thousands, except percentages) Contracts    Gross Balance Outstanding      31  -  60days     61  -  90days     91  -  120 days     Over 120     Total   December 31, 2017    $ 439,828      $ 33,453     $ 14,039     $ 7,893     $ 5,121     $ 60,506              7.61 %      3.19 %      1.79 %      1.16 %      13.76 %  December 31, 2016    $ 499,549      $ 35,184     $ 17,263     $ 11,072     $ 8,645     $ 72,164              7.04 %      3.46 %      2.22 %      1.73 %      14.45 %                                                                 Direct Loans    Gross Balance Outstanding      31  -  60days     61  -  90days     91  -  120 days     Over 120     Total   December 31, 2017    $ 10,566      $ 254     $ 102     $ 32     $ 83     $ 471              2.41 %      0.97 %      0.30 %      0.78 %      4.46 %  December 31, 2016    $ 11,511      $ 282     $ 155     $ 61     $ 64     $ 562              2.45 %      1.34 %      0.53 %      0.56 %      4.88 % 9 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 5. Line of Credit The Company has a line of credit facility (the ""Line"") up to $225.0 million. On November 8, 2017, the Company executed amendment 7 to this existing Line which extended the maturity date to March 31, 2018 and increased the pricing of the Line to 400 basis points above 30 day LIBOR, while maintaining the 1% floor on LIBOR. The amendment also increased the beneficial ownership limit from 20% to 30% and revised the calculation of availability and the minimum interest coverage ratio. The threshold for the minimum interest coverage ratio was lowered for the period ending December 31, 2017. On December 30, 2016, the Company executed an amendment which increased the pricing of the Line to 350 basis points above 30 day LIBOR while maintaining the 1% floor on LIBOR. Prior to December 30, 2016, the pricing on the Line was 300 basis points above 30 day LIBOR with a 1% floor on LIBOR. Pledged as collateral for this Line are all the assets of the Company. The Line requires compliance with certain financial ratios and covenants and satisfaction of specified financial tests, including maintenance of asset quality and performance tests. As of December, 31 2017, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company has a longstanding relationship with its lenders and believes it is probable that it will be able to obtain financing from either its existing lenders or from other sources; however, we can provide no assurances that the lenders will approve the further renewal or extension of the Line past March 31, 2018 or, assuming that they will approve it, that the facility will not be on terms less favorable than the current agreement. The Company may also determine to seek alternative financing, including but not limited to, the issuance of equity or debt; however, we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. 6. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company previously utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in expected cash flows attributable to interest rate risk. The interest rate swap agreements converted a portion of the floating rate debt to a fixed rate, more closely matching the interest rate characteristics of finance receivables. During the nine months ended December 31, 2017, no new contracts were initiated and both interest rate swap contracts matured. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, no new contracts were initiated and no contracts matured. On June 13, 2017 an interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of June 13, 2012, a notional amount of $25.0 million, and a fixed rate of interest of 1.00% expired. On July 30, 2017 an interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of July 30, 2012, a notional amount of $25.0 million, and a fixed rate of interest of 0.87% expired. 10 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 6.

Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed into law (""TCJA""). The TCJA includes a broad range of tax reform including changes to tax rates and deductions that are effective January 1, 2018. The decrease in the enacted corporate tax rate expected to apply when our temporary differences are realized or settled ultimately resulted in a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax asset of $3.4 million in December 2017 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. The tax effects of the TCJA increased income tax expense to a level that reduced net income to a net loss for both the three and nine-month periods ending December 31, 2017. The provision for income taxes increased to approximately $3.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate increased to 456.48% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from 37.93% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The provision for income taxes increased to approximately $4.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $4.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate increased to 164.70% for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 from 38.01% for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. 8. Fair Value Disclosures The Company measures specific assets and liabilities at fair value, which is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When applicable, the Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability under a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 11 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 8. Fair Value Disclosures (continued) Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company estimates the fair value of interest rate swap agreements based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using a forward interest rate yield curve in effect as of the measurement period, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any, including a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of both the Company's credit risk and the counterparty's credit risk. Accordingly, the Company classifies interest rate swap agreements as Level 2.

For each of these financial instruments, the carrying value approximates fair value. Finance receivables, net approximates fair value based on the price paid to acquire Contracts. The price paid reflects competitive market interest rates and purchase discounts for the Company's chosen credit grade in the economic environment. This market is highly liquid as the Company acquires individual loans on a daily basis from dealers. The initial terms of the Contracts generally range from 12 to 72 months. The initial terms of the Direct Loans generally range from 12 to 72 months. If liquidated outside of the normal course of business, the amount received may not be the carrying value. Based on current market conditions, any new or renewed credit facility would contain pricing that approximates the Company's current Line. Based on these market conditions, the fair value of the Line as of December 31, 2017 was estimated to be equal to the book value. The interest rate for the Line is a variable rate based on LIBOR pricing options. 12 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 8.

The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017. 9. Contingencies The Company currently is not a party to any pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business, none of which, if decided adversely to the Company, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 10. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Reclassifications The Company made certain reclassifications to the 2016 statements of cash flows. The amortization of deferred revenues decreased cash flows from operating activities by $1.342 million for 2016 and correspondingly increased cash flows from investing activities. 13 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 10. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued the Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payment. The new guidance focuses on making the Statement of Cash Flows more uniform for companies. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements, and is in the process of analyzing its current presentation of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. At this time, the Company does not believe ASU 2016-15 will have a material impact. In June 2016, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Among other things, the amendments in this ASU require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. The ASU also requires additional disclosures related to estimates and judgments used to measure all expected credit losses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements, and is collecting and analyzing data that will be needed to produce historical inputs into any models created as a result of adopting this ASU. At this time, we believe the adoption of this ASU will likely have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, ""Leases"", intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets - referred to as ""lessees"" - to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The accounting by organizations that own the assets leased by the lessee - also known as lessor accounting -  will remain largely unchanged from current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. While the Company has not specifically evaluated each lease agreement, we anticipate upon adoption, the Company will add the impact of the full operating lease terms that meets the scope, using the present value of future minimum lease payments to the balance sheet. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, ""Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities,"" which is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments by requiring: equity investments (other than equity method or consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for organizations that are not public business entities; eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and requiring a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as ""own credit"") when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. This ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU permits early adoption of the instrument-specific credit risk provision. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of this ASU on the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company does not believe it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 14 Nicholas Financial, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) 10. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"". The ASU requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU, and all subsequently issued clarifying ASUs, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The ASU would permit public entities to adopt the ASU early, but not before the original effective date (i.e., annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The impact of the standard is limited to a large extent due to Topic 606 including a scope exception for finance receivables. Since substantially all of the Company's revenue streams are generated from activities that are outside the scope of the new standard, the Company does not believe that this standard will have a material impact on the Company's financials. The Company has begun analyzing in-scope contracts using the five-step process outlined in Topic 606 and expects to finalize our conclusion during the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The Company does not believe there are any other recently issued accounting standards that have not yet been adopted that will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 15","ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the risk factors below and the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2017, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below, elsewhere in this report and in the Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Our business depends on our continued access to bank financing on acceptable terms. Our business is particularly dependent on our ability to access bank financing at competitive rates. We currently use a $225.0 million line of credit facility (the ""Line"") with a consortium of lenders to finance a large portion of our Contract purchases and Direct Loans. This Line has a maturity date of March 31, 2018.    Effective November 8, 2017, the Company executed amendment 7 to the Line, which extended the maturity date to March 31, 2018 and increased the pricing of the Line to 400 basis points above 30 day LIBOR, while maintaining the 1% floor on LIBOR. The amendment also increased the voting stock ownership limit from 20% to 30% and revised the calculation of availability and the minimum interest coverage ratio. The threshold for the minimum interest coverage ratio was lowered for the period ending December 31, 2017. We can provide no assurances that the lenders will approve the further renewal or extension of the Line past March 31, 2018 or, assuming that they will approve it, that the facility will not be on terms less favorable than the current agreement. If the Company is unable to renew or replace the facility or find alternative financing, or to do so on acceptable terms, it will be unable to finance the same or similar level of Contract purchases or Direct Loans, and will likely be required to curtail portions of its strategic plan. This in turn would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, capital resources and results of operations. Pledged as collateral for the Line are substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Line requires compliance with certain financial ratios and covenants and satisfaction of specified financial tests, including maintenance of asset quality and performance tests. Had the Company not entered into amendment 6 and amendment 7 to the credit agreement, the Company would not have been in compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.5:1 as of June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Failure to meet any financial ratios, covenants or financial tests could result in an event of default under the Line. If an event of default occurs, our lenders could increase our borrowing costs, restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under the facility, accelerate all amounts outstanding under the facility, or enforce their interest against collateral pledged under the facility. Since the borrowings available under the Line are calculated every month based on individual loan criteria as defined in the credit agreement, no assurances can be given that the Company will maintain sufficient availability. As disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the quality of the Company's loan portfolio has generally been deteriorating, which has resulted in an increase in non-performing loans, an increase in delinquencies (with a decrease limited to the quarter ended December 31, 2017) and other factors, which in turn has resulted in increased net charge-offs and an increase in the provision for credit losses. These conditions have resulted in a reduction in net earnings and have affected our borrowing capacity under the Line. The Company may also determine to seek alternative financing, including but not limited through the issuance of equity or debt. We may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our operating activities, we may be required to curtail portions of our strategic plan. Any equity financings may cause substantial dilution to our stockholders and could involve the issuance of securities with rights senior to the common stock. Any allowed debt financings may require us to comply with onerous financial covenants and restrict our business operations. Our ability to complete additional financings is dependent on, among other things, the state of the capital markets at the time of any proposed offering, market reception of the Company and the likelihood of the success of our business model, and the offering terms, among other things. 26 Changes in U.S. federal, state and local tax law or interpretations of existing tax law could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""TCJA""). The changes included in the TCJA are broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the TCJA may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the TCJA, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the TCJA, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the TCJA, or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates. The estimated impact of the new law is based on management's current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and our further analysis of the new law. 27","ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Information This report on Form 10-Q contains various statements, other than those concerning historical information, that are based on management's beliefs and assumptions, as well as information currently available to management, and should be considered forward-looking statements. This notice is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to such forward-looking statements. When used in this document, the words ""anticipate"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""will"", ""may"", ""plan,"" ""believe"", ""intend"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although Nicholas Financial, Inc., including its subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our"") believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

Litigation and Legal Matters See ""Item 1. Legal Proceedings"" in Part II of this Form 10-Q. Critical Accounting Policy The Company's critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for credit losses. It is based on management's opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses incurred in the existing portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses based on management's evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio which includes the competitive environment that existed when the loan was acquired, the composition of the portfolio, and current economic conditions. Such evaluation considers, among other matters, the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, management's estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate credit loss allowance. Because of the nature of the customers under the Company's Contracts and its Direct Loan program, the Company considers the establishment of adequate reserves for credit losses to be imperative. The Company segregates its Contracts into static pools for purposes of establishing reserves for losses. All Contracts purchased by a branch during a fiscal quarter comprise a static pool. The Company pools Contracts according to branch location because the branches purchase Contracts in different geographic markets. This method of pooling by branch and quarter allows the Company to evaluate the different markets where the branches operate. The pools also allow the Company to evaluate the different levels of customer income, stability and credit history, and the types of vehicles purchased, in each market. In analyzing a static pool, the Company considers the performance of prior static pools originated by the same branch office, the competition at time of acquisition, and current market and economic conditions. Each static pool is analyzed monthly to determine if the loss reserves are adequate, and adjustments are made if they are determined to be necessary. A consolidated static pool contains the static pools of all branches for a given quarter. The Company analyzes each consolidated static pool at specific points in time. 16 The Company has been maintaining historical write-off information for over 20 years with respect to every consolidated static pool, segregating each consolidated static pool by liquidation and in effect creating snapshots of a pool's write-off-to liquidation ratio at five different points in such pool's liquidation cycle. These snapshots help the Company in determining the appropriate provision for credit losses and subsequent allowance for credit losses. The five snapshots are taken when the liquidation levels are at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%. The Company's allowance for credit losses incorporates recent trends that include the acquisition of longer term contracts and increased delinquencies which the Company believes more closely depicts the amount of the allowance for credit losses needed to maintain an adequate reserve. Management evaluates each static pool on an independent basis each quarter and accounts for such pool's term, how far along the corresponding pool is in its liquidation cycle, late charges, the number of deferments, and delinquency. This information is based on the result each individual Contract. The Company believes that this approach reflects the current trends of incurred losses within the portfolio and better aligns the allowance for credit losses with the portfolio's performance indicators. Contracts are purchased from many different dealers and are all purchased on an individual Contract-by-Contract basis. Individual Contract pricing is determined by the automobile dealerships and is generally based on the lesser of the applicable state maximum interest rate, if any, or the maximum interest rate which the customer will accept. In most markets, competitive forces will drive down Contract rates from the maximum rate to a level where an individual competitor is willing to buy an individual Contract. The Company does not anticipate any portfolio acquisitions in the near-term. The Company utilizes the branch model, which allows for Contract purchasing to be done at the branch level. The Company has detailed underwriting guidelines it utilizes to determine which Contracts to purchase. These guidelines are specific and are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Contracts that the Company purchases have common risk characteristics. The Company utilizes its District Managers to evaluate their respective branch locations for adherence to these underwriting guidelines, as well as approve underwriting exceptions. The Company also utilizes internal audit (the ""IA"") to assure adherence to its underwriting guidelines. Any Contract that does not meet our underwriting guidelines can be submitted by a branch manager for approval from the Company's District Managers or senior management. Introduction Pretax income for the three months ending December 31, 2017 was $.8 million. In the month of December 2017, the Company had a one-time income tax expense adjustment of $3.4 million relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA"") which reduced net income to a net loss. The net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.9 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2016 the Company had pretax earnings of $2.6 million and net earnings of $1.6 million. Diluted net loss per share decreased to $0.37 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.21 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Revenue decreased 7% to $20.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $22.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The Company announced that its pretax income for the nine months ending December 31, 2017 was $2.7 million. In the month of December 2017, the Company had a one-time income tax expense adjustment of $3.4 million relating to the TCJA which reduced net income to a net loss. The net loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.7 million. For the nine months ended December 31, 2016 the Company had pretax earnings of $10.5 million and net earnings of $6.5 million. Diluted net loss per share decreased to $0.22 for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.83 for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. Revenue decreased 5% to $64.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $67.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed into law (""TCJA""). The TCJA includes a broad range of tax reform including changes to tax rates and deductions that are effective January 1, 2018. The decrease in the enacted corporate tax rate expected to apply when our temporary differences are realized or settled ultimately resulted in a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax asset of $3.4 million in December 2017 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. The tax effects of the TCJA increased income tax expense to a level that reduced net income to a net loss for both the three and nine-month periods ending December 31, 2017. 17 Three months ended December 31, (In thousands)     Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands)       2017     2016     2017     2016   Portfolio Summary                      Average finance receivables, net of unearned interest (1)    $ 321,742     $ 349,916     $ 333,660     $ 345,950                                            Average indebtedness (2)    $ 183,615     $ 210,745     $ 196,619     $ 209,875                                            Interest and fee income on finance receivables    $ 20,526     $ 22,044     $ 64,062     $ 67,606   Interest expense      2,585       2,258       7,483       6,745                                            Net interest and fee income on finance receivables    $ 17,941     $ 19,786     $ 56,579     $ 60,861                                            Gross portfolio yield (3)      25.52 %      25.20 %      25.60 %      26.06 %  Interest expense as a percentage of average finance receivables, net of unearned interest       3.21 %      2.58 %      2.99 %      2.60 %  Provision for credit losses as a percentage of average finance receivables, net of unearned interest      11.18 %      10.05 %      11.54 %      9.24 %                                           Net portfolio yield (3)      11.13 %      12.57 %      11.07 %      14.22 %  Marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation, and administrative expenses as a percentage of average finance receivables, net of unearned interest      10.12 %      9.70 %      9.98 %      10.26 %                                           Pre-tax yield as a percentage of average finance receivables, net of unearned interest (4)      1.01 %      2.87 %      1.09 %      3.96 %                                           Write-off to liquidation (5)      13.66 %      12.35 %      13.00 %      11.02 %  Net charge-off percentage (6)      10.63 %      8.86 %      10.13 %      8.57 %  Allowance percentage (7)      6.59 %      4.21 %      6.35 %      4.26 % Note: All three-month and nine-month statement of income performance indicators expressed as percentages have been annualized. (1) Average finance receivables, net of unearned interest, represents the average of gross finance receivables, less unearned interest throughout the period. (2) Average indebtedness represents the average outstanding borrowings under the Line (3) Gross portfolio yield represents interest and fee income on finance receivables as a percentage of average finance receivables, net of unearned interest.

(4) Pre-tax yield represents net portfolio yield minus administrative expenses (marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation, and administrative), as a percentage of average finance receivables, net of unearned interest. (5) Write-off to liquidation percentage is defined as net charge-offs divided by liquidation. Liquidation is defined as beginning receivable balance plus current period purchases and originations minus ending receivable balance. (6) Net charge-off percentage represents net charge-offs (charge-offs less recoveries) divided by average finance receivables, net of unearned interest, outstanding during the period. (7) Allowance percentage represents the allowance for credit losses divided by average finance receivables, net of unearned interest, outstanding during the period. 18 Three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to three months ended December 31, 2016 Interest Income and Loan Portfolio Interest and fee income on finance receivables, predominately finance charge income, decreased 7% to $20.5 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 from $22.0 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average weighted APR of the portfolio, and a decrease in the volume of Contracts purchased. Average finance receivables, net of unearned interest equaled approximately $321.7 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 8% from $349.9 million for the corresponding period ended December 31, 2016. Our purchasing volume declined 39% quarter over quarter mainly as a result of the modification of our underwriting guidelines, including the use of alternative data provided by a third party service company beginning in March 2017, to improve pricing for proper risk. The decrease in average finance receivables, net of unearned interest was primarily due to this decrease in purchasing volume. The gross portfolio yield increased to 25.52% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to 25.20% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. The gross portfolio yield increased primarily due to the decrease in past-due accounts (see ""Note 4- Finance Receivables"" for further discussion). The net portfolio yield decreased to 11.13% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 from 12.57% for the corresponding period ended December 31, 2016. The net portfolio yield decreased due to an increase in interest expense, as described under ""Interest Expense"", and an increase in the provision for credit losses, as described under ""Analysis of Credit Losses"". Marketing, Salaries, Employee Benefits, Depreciation, and Administrative Expenses Marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation, and administrative expenses decreased to approximately $8.1 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $8.5 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in bonuses related to the declining portfolio performance along with a decrease in administrative costs directly related to the volume of Contracts purchased. Marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation, and administrative expenses as a percentage of finance receivables, net of unearned interest, increased to 10.12% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 from 9.70% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to approximately $2.6 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2.3 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the pricing to 400 basis points above 30 day LIBOR and an increase in 30 day LIBOR rates. Pricing prior to November 7, 2017 was 350 basis points above 30 day LIBOR. Pricing for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016 was 300 basis points above 30 day LIBOR until December 30, 2016, when it changed to 350 basis points above 30 day LIBOR. This change continued until the November 7, 2017 amendment. See below for more details. The following table summarizes the Company's average cost of borrowed funds: Three months ended December 31,       2017     2016   Variable interest under the line of credit facility      0.63 %      0.21 %  Settlements under interest rate swap agreements      0.00 %      0.09 %  Credit spread under the line of credit facility      5.00 %      4.00 %                       Average cost of borrowed funds      5.63 %      4.30 % LIBOR rates have increased (1.57% as of December 31, 2017 compared to .77% as of December 31, 2016) which caused an increase in variable interest for the amount that exceeded the 1% floor. Average cost of borrowed funds is greater than the highest 30 day LIBOR rate plus 400 basis points, or 5.57%, due to amortized loan costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, the Company's remaining interest rate swap expired (see ""Note 6- Interest Rate Swap Agreements"" for further discussion) but these did not have a significant effect on borrowing costs. For further discussions regarding interest rates see ""Note 5  -  Line of Credit"". 19 Nine months ended December 31, 2017 compared to nine months ended December 31, 2016 Interest Income and Loan Portfolio Interest and fee income on finance receivables, predominately finance charge income, decreased 5% to $64.1 million for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 from $67.6 million for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average weighted APR of the portfolio, and a decrease in the volume of Contracts purchased. Average finance receivables, net of unearned interest equaled approximately $333.7 million for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 4% from $346.0 million for the corresponding period ended December 31, 2016. Our purchasing volume declined 36% period over period mainly as a result of the modification of our underwriting guidelines, including the use of alternative data provided by a third party service company beginning in March 2017, to improve pricing for proper risk. The decrease in average finance receivables, net of unearned interest was primarily due to this decrease in purchasing volume. The gross portfolio yield decreased to 25.60% for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to 26.06% for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016. The gross portfolio yield decreased primarily due to the decrease in the average weighted APR of the portfolio described above. The net portfolio yield decreased to 11.07% for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 from 14.22% for the corresponding period ended December 31, 2016. The net portfolio yield decreased due to a decrease in the gross portfolio yield, but primarily to an increase in the provision for credit losses, as described under ""Analysis of Credit Losses"". Marketing, Salaries, Employee Benefits, Depreciation, and Administrative Expenses Marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation, and administrative expenses decreased to approximately $25.0 million for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $26.6 million for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the amount of Contracts purchased and a decrease in average headcount for the nine months ended December 31, 2017. The Company decreased average headcount to 305 for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 from 317 for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016, mainly due to branch closures. Marketing, salaries, employee benefits, depreciation, and administrative expenses as a percentage of finance receivables, net of unearned interest, decreased to 9.98% for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 from 10.26% for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to approximately $7.5 million for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $6.7 million for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the pricing to 400 basis points above 30 day LIBOR and an increase in 30 day LIBOR rates. Pricing prior to November 7, 2017 was 350 basis points above 30 day LIBOR. Pricing for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016 was 300 basis points above 30 day LIBOR until December 30, 2016, when it changed to 350 basis points above 30 day LIBOR.

The increase in LIBOR rates also caused a decrease in expense related to our interest rate swap agreements. During the nine months ended December 31, 2017, both of the Company's interest rate swaps expired (see ""Note 6- Interest Rate Swap Agreements"" for further discussion) but these did not have a significant effect on borrowing costs.

The average pool upon inception consisted of 49 Contracts with aggregate finance receivables, net of unearned interest, of approximately $570,000. The provision for credit losses increased to $9.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $8.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, largely due to the net charge-off percentage (see note 6 in the Portfolio Summary table in the ""Introduction"" above for the definition of net charge-off percentage) increasing to 10.63% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from 8.86% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 for the reasons described below. The provision for credit losses increased to approximately $28.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $24.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily a result of an increase in the net charge-off rate to 10.13% for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 from 8.57% for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 for the reasons described below. The Company's allowance for credit losses incorporates recent trends that include increased delinquencies by analyzing the allowance on a loan by loan basis, which the Company believes more closely depicts the amount of the allowance for credit losses needed to maintain an adequate reserve within a static pool. The Company believes that this approach reflects the current trends of incurred losses within the portfolio and better aligns the allowance for credit losses with the portfolio's performance indicators. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of average net receivables (see note 7 in the Portfolio Summary table in the ""Introduction"" above for the definition of allowance percentage) increased to 6.59% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from 4.21% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of average net receivables increased to 6.35% for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 from 4.26% for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in write-off to liquidation to 13.66% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from 12.35% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and to 13.00% for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 from 11.02% for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. The Company considers multiple factors to assist in determining appropriate loss reserve levels. The Company continues to evaluate reserve levels on a pool-by-pool basis during each reporting period. The longer-term outlook for portfolio performance will depend on overall economic conditions, the rational or irrational behavior of the Company's competitors, and the Company's ability to monitor, manage and implement its underwriting and collections philosophy in additional geographic areas as it strives to continue its expansion. The Company's loan losses as a percentage of liquidation (see note 5 in the Portfolio Summary table in the ""Introduction"" above for the definition of write-off to liquidation) increased to 13.66% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 12.35% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The Company's losses as a percentage of liquidation increased to 13.00% for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 11.02% for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. The increases in the net charge-off percentage, write-off to liquidation percentage and allowance percentage for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2017 were primarily the result of the Company underestimating the competitiveness of the market in prior years and purchasing loans of lower credit quality in such years. As these loans move toward maturity, the actual losses do not occur evenly over their respective lives. Within both the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2017, the Company saw more charge-offs in these lower quality pools than it saw for the same pools during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2016. At the beginning of 2016, the Company implemented measures to mitigate losses, identify fraud on the front end, and more accurately price 22 for risk. In January of 2016, the Company modified its underwriting policies, in March of 2017 the Company engaged a third party service company, to more accurately price risk, and in June of 2017, the Company created a centralized funding department to provide a final review of all Contracts prior to funding. The Company also continues to see decreased auction proceeds from repossessed vehicles, which increases the amount of write-offs which, in turn, increases the write-off to liquidation percentage, allowance percentage and net charge-off percentage. During the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, auction proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles averaged approximately 36% and 37%, respectively, of the related principal balance. During the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, auction proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles averaged approximately 35% and 38%, respectively, of the related principal balance. Based on current market conditions, the Company does not expect auction proceeds to improve within the remaining quarters of the fiscal year. Recoveries as a percentage of charge-offs were approximately 4.10% and 6.88% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Recoveries as a percentage of charge-offs were approximately 5.26% and 7.49% for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company attributes a large portion of this decrease simply to the increase in charge-offs for the 2017 periods, and to a lesser extent to the September 1, 2016, change in its accounting policy to write off accounts that are 180+ delinquent (from 120+ days delinquent). The Company periodically aggregates charge-off accounts it deems uncollectible and sells them to a third-party. For the nine months ended December 31,2016 the Company received approximately $225k from a third party sale, this has not occurred in the nine-months ended December 31, 2017. The delinquency percentage for Contracts more than thirty days past due, excluding Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts, as of December 31, 2017 was 13.76%, a decrease from 14.45% as of December 31, 2016. The delinquency percentage for Direct Loans more than thirty days past due, excluding Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts, as of December 31, 2017 was 4.46%, a decrease from 4.88% as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in delinquency percentage for both Contracts and Direct Loans was driven primarily by portfolio improvement. The delinquency percentage for the period ended December 31, 2016 was exacerbated by greater than anticipated difficulties in implementing a centralized collection model in October 2016, after the Company moved all loan-servicing operations from branch locations to a centralized location within its corporate headquarters in Clearwater. The Company has since moved all of its collections back to the branches. The Company has continued to see a significant number of competitors with aggressive underwriting in its operating market. See ""Note 4 - Finance Receivables"" for changes in allowance for credit losses, credit quality and delinquencies. In accordance with our policies and procedures, certain borrowers qualify for, and the Company offers, one-month principal payment deferrals on Contracts and Direct Loans. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company granted deferrals to approximately 7.47% and 11.84%, respectively, of total Contracts and Direct Loans. For the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company granted deferrals to approximately 30.34% and 22.85%, respectively, of total Contracts and Direct Loans. The increase in the number of deferrals for the nine month period ended December 31, 2017 was mainly a result of the impact of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey, with 42% of our branch locations located in areas that were affected by these storms. The Company offered deferrals to those customers that were impacted to assist them during a time of crisis. Additionally, deferments are influenced by portfolio performance, including but not limited to, inflation, credit quality of loans purchased, competition at the time of Contract acquisition, and general economic conditions. Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed into law (""TCJA""). The TCJA includes a broad range of tax reform including changes to tax rates and deductions that are effective January 1, 2018. The decrease in the enacted corporate tax rate expected to apply when our temporary differences are realized or settled ultimately resulted in a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax asset of $3.4 million in December 2017 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. The tax effects of the TCJA increased income tax expense to a level that reduced net income to a net loss for both the three and nine-month periods ending December 31, 2017. The provision for income taxes increased to approximately $3.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate increased to 456.48% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from 37.93% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The provision for income taxes increased to approximately $4.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $4.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate increased to 164.70% for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 from 38.01% for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. 23 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's cash flows are summarized as follows: Nine months ended December 31, (In thousands)       2017      2016   Cash provided by (used in):             Operating activities    $ 18,551      $ 22,518   Investing activities      16,214        (24,232 )  Financing activities      (34,538 )       3,529                         Net increase in cash    $ 227      $ 1,815 The Company's primary use of working capital for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was funding the purchase of Contracts, which are financed substantially through cash from principal payments received, cash from operations and our line of credit (the ""Line""). The Company may borrow up to $225.0 million under the Line. Effective November 8, 2017, the Company executed amendment 7 to the Line which extended the maturity date to March 31, 2018 and increased the pricing of the Line to 400 basis points above 30 day LIBOR, while maintaining the 1% floor on LIBOR. The amendment also increased the voting stock ownership limit from 20% to 30% and revised the calculation of availability and the minimum interest coverage ratio. The threshold for the minimum interest coverage ratio was lowered for the period ending December 31, 2017. On December 30, 2016, the Company had executed an amendment which increased the pricing of the Line to 350 basis points above 30 day LIBOR while maintaining the 1% floor on LIBOR. This pricing was maintained under a subsequent amendment effective June 30, 2017. Prior to December 30, 2016, the pricing on the Line was 300 basis points above 30 day LIBOR with a 1% floor on LIBOR. Pledged as collateral for this Line are all the assets of the Company. The Line requires compliance with certain financial ratios and covenants and satisfaction of specified financial tests, including maintenance of asset quality and performance tests. As of December 31, 2017, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants. Had the Company not entered into amendment 6 and amendment 7 to the credit agreement, the Company would not have been in compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.5:1 as of June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the amount outstanding under the Line was $178.0 million, while the average amount outstanding during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $183.6 million and $196.6 million, respectively. The exact amount that the Company may borrow under the Line at any given time is determined in accordance with the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, as subsequently amended. The Company will continue to depend on the availability of the Line, together with cash from operations, to finance future operations. The availability of funds under the Line generally depends on availability calculations as defined in the corresponding credit agreement. In addition, our credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and covenants and to satisfy specified financial tests, including maintenance of asset quality and portfolio performance tests. Since the borrowings available under the Line are calculated every month based on individual loan criteria as defined in the credit agreement, no assurances can be given that the Company will maintain sufficient availability. As disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the quality of the Company's loan portfolio has generally been deteriorating, which has resulted in an increase in non-performing loans, an increase in delinquencies (with a decrease limited to the quarter ended December 31, 2017) and other factors, which in turn has resulted in increased net charge-offs and an increase in the provision for credit losses. These conditions have resulted in a reduction in net earnings and have affected our borrowing capacity under the credit facility. Failure to meet any financial ratios, covenants or financial tests could result in an event of default under our line of credit facility. If an event of default occurs under the credit facility, our lenders could increase our borrowing costs, restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under the facility, accelerate all amounts outstanding under the facility, or enforce their interest against collateral pledged under the facility. The Company has a longstanding relationship with its lenders and believes it is probable that it will be able to obtain financing from either its existing lenders or from other sources. However, the Line currently matures on March 31,2018. The Company can provide no assurances that the lenders will approve the further renewal or extension of the Line past its current maturity or, assuming that they will approve it, that the facility will not be on terms less favorable than the current agreement. The Company may also determine to seek alternative financing, including but not limited to, the issuance of equity or debt; however, we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. 24 See also ""Our business depends on our continued access to bank financing on acceptable terms"" in ""1A. Risk Factors"" in this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Company's material obligations as of December 31, 2017. Payments Due by Period (In thousands)       Total      Less than 1 year      1 to 3 years      3 to 5 years      More than 5 years   Operating leases    $ 4,153      $ 2,505      $ 1,578      $ 70      $  -      Line of credit1      178,000        178,000         -            -            -      Interest on Line1      2,479        2,479         -            -            -                                                             Total    $ 184,632      $ 182,984      $ 1,578      $ 70      $  - 1. The Company's Line matures on March 31, 2018. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the Line as of December 31, 2017, is based on an effective interest rate of 5.57%. The effective interest rate used in the above table does not contemplate the possibility of entering into interest rate swap agreements in the future.","ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Company's operations result primarily from changes in interest rates. The Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest rate risk Management's objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, may be used to managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations. The Company does not use interest rate swap agreements for speculative purposes and does not currently have any active agreements. As of December 31, 2017, $178.0 million, or 100.00% of our total debt, was subject to floating interest rates. As a result, a hypothetical increase in LIBOR of 1% or 100 basis points (based on actual LIBOR rates of 1.57% as of December 31, 2017) would have resulted in an annual after-tax increase of interest expense of approximately $1.2 million.","ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company currently is not a party to any pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business, none of which, if decided adversely to the Company, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.","ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company's management evaluated, with the participation of the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 25","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000045/0001193125-18-037381-index.html"

At the end of February 2018, our sales order backlog/forward load further increased to $19.0 million, or approximately 14 to 15 weeks of net sales (on a trailing 12 month basis), as compared to our sales order backlog/forward load that varies throughout the year, but is generally between approximately 3 to 4 weeks of net sales, or approximately $4 million to $5 million. As a result, at this time we believe it is likely we will see a significant positive impact on net sales during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to the same period last year. ● 			 			 			Gross profit increased 8.7% to $5.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $4.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. ● 			 			 			Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) was 29.8% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to 32.9% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. 15 Table of Contents ● 			 			 			Net loss was $410,000, or $0.06 per share, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $616,000, or $0.09 per share, for the comparable period last year. Results of Operations We sell our products internationally and domestically to our customers, which include major distributors, various regional and smaller distributors, original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers. All of our sales to customers outside of the United States are denominated in U.S. dollars. We can experience fluctuations in the percentage of net sales to customers outside of the United States and in the United States from period to period based on the timing of large orders, coupled with the impact of increases and decreases in sales to customers in various regions of the world. Sales outside of the U.S. can also be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies. Net sales consist of gross sales of products by the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis less discounts, refunds and returns. Revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment or delivery to the customer (including distributors) provided that the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss (based on shipping terms), collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. Our customers generally do not have the right of return unless a product is defective or damaged and is within the parameters of the product warranty in effect for the sale. Cost of goods sold consists of the cost of materials, product warranty costs and compensation costs, and overhead and other costs related to our manufacturing operations. The largest percentage of costs included in cost of goods sold is attributable to costs of materials. Our gross profit margin percentages are heavily dependent upon product mix on a quarterly basis and may vary based on changes in product mix.  To the extent not negatively impacted by product mix, gross profit margins tend to be higher when we achieve higher net sales levels, as certain fixed manufacturing costs are spread over higher sales. Hybrid cables (fiber and copper) with higher copper content tend to have lower gross profit margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A expenses”) consist of the compensation costs for sales and marketing personnel, shipping costs, trade show expenses, customer support expenses, travel expenses, advertising, bad debt expense, the compensation costs for administration and management personnel, legal, accounting, advisory and professional fees, costs incurred to settle litigation or claims and other actions against us, and other costs associated with our operations. Royalty income (expense), net consists of royalty income earned on licenses associated with our patented products, net of royalty and related expenses. Amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of the costs, including legal fees, associated with internally developed patents that have been granted. Amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. Other income (expense), net consists of interest expense and other miscellaneous income and expense items not directly attributable to our operations. 16 Table of Contents The following table sets forth and highlights fluctuations in selected line items from our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended 			January 31, 			  			  			 Percent 			  		  			  			 			2018 			 			  			  			 			2017 			 			  			  			 			Change 			 			  		 			Net sales 			 			  			$ 			17,551,000 			  			  			$ 			14,606,000 			  			  			  			20.2 			 			% 			 		 			Gross profit 			 			  			  			5,229,000 			  			  			  			4,810,000 			  			  			  			8.7 			 			% 			 		 			SG&A expenses 			 			  			  			5,558,000 			  			  			  			5,193,000 			  			  			  			7.0 			 			% 			 		 			Net loss 			 			  			  			(410,000 			) 			  			  			(616,000 			) 			  			  			33.4 			 			% Three Months Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 increased 20.2% to $17.6 million compared to net sales of $14.6 million for the same period last year. Sequentially, consolidated net sales increased 2.0% compared to net sales of $17.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. We experienced an increase in net sales in our specialty markets in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the same period last year, particularly in our military and wireless carrier markets. This increase in the specialty markets was partially offset by a decrease in net sales in our enterprise markets. Net sales to customers outside of the United States increased 32.1% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to the same period last year, and net sales to customers in the United States increased 17.3% compared to the same period last year. During our first fiscal quarter of 2018, we experienced an increase in our sales order backlog/forward load—particularly for our fiber optic cable products. Generally, OCC’s consolidated sales order backlog/forward load varies throughout the year between approximately 3 to 4 weeks of net sales, or approximately $4 million to $5 million. As of January 31, 2018, our sales order backlog/forward load was $14.8 million, or approximately 11 to 12 weeks of net sales (on a trailing 12 month basis). At the end of February 2018, our sales order backlog/forward load further increased to $19.0 million, or approximately 14 to 15 weeks of net sales (on a trailing 12 month basis). As a result of our elevated sales order backlog/forward load, at this time, we believe it is likely we will see a significant positive impact on net sales during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to the same period last year. Our current sales order backlog/forward load includes orders for hybrid fiber optic cable products with high copper content. Certain of these particular orders are for hybrid products that tend to have lower gross profit margins. Gross Profit Our gross profit increased to $5.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, an increase of 8.7% compared to gross profit of $4.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was 29.8% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to 32.9% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our gross profit margin percentages are heavily dependent upon product mix on a quarterly basis. Gross profit margin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was negatively impacted primarily due to a shift in product mix toward the sale of certain lower margin products in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. 17 Table of Contents Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased 7.0% to $5.6 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $5.2 million for the same period last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 31.7% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to 35.6% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the same period last year was primarily the result of increased employee related costs totaling $375,000. Compensation costs have increased largely as a result of new hires, selectively added to accomplish long-term strategic objectives, and increases in commissions due to increases in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Royalty Income (Expense), Net We recognized royalty income, net of royalty and related expenses, totaling $5,000 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to royalty expense, net of royalty income, totaling $31,000 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The change when comparing the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 to the same period last year is due to the expiration of a patent in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a previously licensed product sold by OCC. We expect the trend of royalty income to offset royalty expense to continue in fiscal year 2018. Amortization of Intangible Assets We recognized $7,000 of amortization expense, associated with intangible assets, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $6,000 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Other Expense, Net We recognized other expense, net in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 of $119,000 compared to $217,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Other expense, net is comprised primarily of interest expense together with other miscellaneous items which may fluctuate from period to period. The decrease in other expense, net during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the decrease in the interest rates, effective in fiscal year 2017, of our real estate term loans and revolving credit note. Loss Before Income Taxes We reported a loss before income taxes of $450,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $636,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of $418,000, partially offset by the increase in SG&A expenses of $365,000, compared to the same period in 2017. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit totaled $39,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $21,000 for the same period in fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 8.8% compared to 3.2% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Fluctuations in our effective tax rates are primarily due to permanent differences in U.S. GAAP and tax accounting for various tax deductions and benefits, but can also be significantly different from the statutory tax rate when income or loss before taxes is at a level such that permanent differences in U.S. GAAP and tax accounting treatment have a disproportional impact on the projected effective tax rate. 18 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2015, we established a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets. As a result of establishing a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, if we generate sufficient taxable income in subsequent periods to realize a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets, our effective income tax rate could be unusually low due to the tax benefit attributable to the necessary decrease in our valuation allowance. Further, if we generate losses before taxes in subsequent periods, as we did in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, our effective income tax rate could also be unusually low as any increase in our net deferred tax asset from such a net operating loss for tax purposes would be offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. If we generate sufficient income before taxes in future periods such that U.S. GAAP would permit us to conclude that the removal of any valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset is appropriate, then during the period in which such determination is made, we will recognize the non-cash benefit of such removal of the valuation allowance in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations, which will increase net income and will also increase the net deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet. If we do not generate sufficient income before taxes in future periods such that U.S. GAAP would permit us to conclude that the reduction or removal of any valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset is appropriate, then no such non-cash benefit would be realized. There can be no assurance regarding any future realization of the benefit by us of all or part of our net deferred tax assets. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. Because our fiscal year 2018 commenced on November 1, 2017, the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate applicable to fiscal year 2018 is a blended rate of 23.2%. Beginning in our 2019 fiscal year, the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate will be 21%. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance in the period that includes the enactment date of the Tax Act, resulting in a reduction of $1.3 million in both our net deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance. The use of a blended rate may result in further adjustment to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, when the annual results are finalized and the annual change in gross temporary differences are determined. Because we decreased both our net deferred tax assets and our valuation allowance by the same amount, there was no impact on our results of operations from the remeasurement. Any future benefit we may realize from our net deferred tax assets is effectively reduced by $1.3 million, adjusted for any changes that may be recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, as a result of the remeasurement. As of October 31, 2017, prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, our valuation allowance totaled $3.6 million, completely offsetting our net deferred tax assets. Net Loss Net loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $410,000 compared to $616,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. This improvement was primarily due to the decrease in loss before income taxes of $187,000. Financial Condition Total assets increased $2.5 million, or 6.2%, to $42.6 million at January 31, 2018, from $40.1 million at October 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in trade accounts receivable, net and an $840,000 increase in inventories. The increase in trade accounts receivable, net largely resulted from the increase in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Inventories increased as the result of the timing of certain raw material purchases and increases in work in process levels related to pending shipments. 19 Table of Contents Total liabilities increased $2.9 million, or 17.7%, to $19.4 million at January 31, 2018, from $16.4 million at October 31, 2017. The increase in total liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling $2.4 million, primarily resulting from purchases of raw materials in preparation for the manufacture and shipment of orders in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 for which payment was not yet due as of January 31, 2018. Total shareholders’ equity at January 31, 2018 decreased $432,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The decrease resulted primarily from a net loss of $410,000. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary capital needs during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 have been to fund working capital requirements and to make principal payments on long-term debt. Our primary source of capital for these purposes has been existing cash, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash provided by operations. Our cash totaled $529,000 as of January 31, 2018, a decrease of $362,000, compared to $891,000 as of October 31, 2017. The decrease in cash for the three months ended January 31, 2018 primarily resulted from net cash used in operating activities of $298,000. On January 31, 2018, we had working capital of $23.0 million compared to $22.9 million on October 31, 2017. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of January 31, 2018 was 4.3 to 1 compared to 6.5 to 1 as of October 31, 2017. The increase in working capital was primarily due to the $2.4 million increase in trade accounts receivable, net and the $840,000 increase in inventories, partially offset by the $2.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The decrease in the current ratio was primarily due to the fact that current assets increased $2.8 million, or 10.4%, while current liabilities increased $2.8 million, or 66.2%. As of January 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, we had outstanding loan balances under our revolving credit facilities totaling $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, we had outstanding loan balances, excluding our revolving credit facility, totaling $6.6 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Net Cash Net cash used in operating activities was $298,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $69,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Net cash used in operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 primarily resulted from an increase in the cash flow impact of increases in trade accounts receivable, net totaling $2.4 million and an increase in inventories totaling $840,000, partially offset by certain adjustments to reconcile a net loss of $410,000 to net cash used in operating activities including depreciation and amortization of $408,000 and share-based compensation expense of $113,000. Additionally, the cash flow impact of increases in accounts payable and accrued expense of $2.5 million further contributed to offset net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 primarily resulted from an increase in inventories totaling $1.0 million, partially offset by certain adjustments to reconcile a net loss of $616,000 to net cash used in operating activities including depreciation, amortization and accretion of $506,000 and share-based compensation expense of $149,000. Additionally, the cash flow impact of decreases in accounts receivable, net of $383,000 and the cash flow impact of increases in accounts payable and accrued expense of $465,111 further contributed to offset net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $68,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $66,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Net cash used in investing activities during the first quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 resulted primarily from purchases of property and equipment and deposits for the purchase of property and equipment. 20 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $3,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $499,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 resulted primarily from proceeds from a note payable to our bank under our line of credit, net of repayments, totaling $200,000, partially offset by payroll taxes withheld and remitted on share-based payments totaling $135,000 and principal payments on long-term debt totaling $61,000. Net cash used in financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 resulted primarily from repayments on the revolving credit facility totaling $400,000. We have a plan (the “Repurchase Plan”), approved by our Board of Directors on July 14, 2015, to purchase and retire up to 400,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 6.0% of the shares then outstanding. When the Repurchase Plan was approved, we had anticipated that the purchases would be made over a 24- to 36-month period, but there was no definite time period for repurchase, or plan expiration. As of January 31, 2018, we had 398,400 shares remaining to purchase under this Repurchase Plan. Credit Facilities We have credit facilities consisting of a real estate term loan, as amended and restated (the “Virginia Real Estate Loan”), a supplemental real estate term loan, as amended and restated (the “North Carolina Real Estate Loan”) and a revolving credit note. Both the Virginia Real Estate Loan and the North Carolina Real Estate Loan are with Pinnacle Financial Partners (“Pinnacle”), have a fixed interest rate of 3.95% and are secured by a first priority lien on all of our personal property and assets, all money, goods, machinery, equipment, fixtures, inventory, accounts, chattel paper, letter of credit rights, deposit accounts, commercial tort claims, documents, instruments, investment property and general intangibles now owned or hereafter acquired by us and wherever located, as well as a first lien deed of trust on our real property. Our Revolving Credit Note (“Revolver”) with Pinnacle provides the Company with a $7.0 million revolving line of credit (“Revolving Loan”) for our working capital needs. Under the Revolver, Pinnacle provides us with one or more revolving loans in a collective maximum principal amount of $7.0 million. We may borrow, repay, and reborrow at any time or from time to time while the Revolving Loan is in effect. The maturity date of the Revolver is currently March 31, 2019. The applicable margin in the Revolving Credit Note has a floor on the interest rate for the Revolving Credit Note such that the rate will never be less than 2.50% per annum. The Revolving Loan accrues interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% (resulting in a 4.07% rate at January 31, 2018). The Revolving Loan is payable in monthly payments of interest only with principal and any outstanding interest due and payable at maturity. The Revolving Loan is secured by a perfected first lien security interest on all assets, including but not limited to, accounts, as-extracted collateral, chattel paper, commodity accounts, commodity contracts, deposit accounts, documents, equipment, fixtures, furniture, general intangibles, goods, instruments, inventory, investment property, letter of credit rights, payment intangibles, promissory notes, software and general tangible and intangible assets owned now or later acquired. The Revolving Loan is also cross-collateralized with our real property. As of January 31, 2018, we had $5.9 million of outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Loan and $1.1 million in available credit. 21 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of January 31, 2018. During our 2018 fiscal year budgeting process, we included an estimate for capital expenditures of $2.0 million for the year. We anticipate these expenditures will be funded out of our working capital or borrowings, including under our credit facility. Capital expenditures are reviewed and approved based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, current cash flow considerations, the expected return on investment, project priorities, impact on current or future product offerings, availability of personnel necessary to implement and begin using acquired equipment, and economic conditions in general. Historically, we have spent less than our budgeted capital expenditures in most fiscal years. Corporate acquisitions and other strategic investments, if any, are considered outside of our annual capital expenditure budgeting process. Future Cash Flow Considerations We believe that our future cash flow from operations, our cash on hand and our existing credit facilities or any additional credit facilities we may originate will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. At the end of February 2018, our sales order backlog/forward load was $19.0 million, or approximately 14 to 15 weeks of net sales (on a trailing 12 month basis). As a result of our significant backlog/forward load and timing differences between required payments on purchases of materials and receipts on shipments related to these orders, we are in the process of working with Pinnacle to increase the availability on our Revolver. At this time, we believe the steps we are taking are sufficient to address our short-term working capital requirements resulting from our current backlog/forward load. From time to time, we are involved in various claims, legal actions and regulatory reviews arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Seasonality We typically expect net sales to be relatively lower in the first half of each fiscal year and relatively higher in the second half of each fiscal year, which we believe may be partially due to the construction cycles, buying patterns and budgetary considerations of our customers. Our trend for the last three fiscal years has been that an average of approximately 48%, 47% and 49% of our net sales occurred during the first half of fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and an average of approximately 52%, 53% and 51% of our net sales occurred during the second half of fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This trend may be substantially altered during any quarter or year by the timing of larger projects, timing of orders from larger customers, other economic factors impacting our industry or impacting the industries of our customers and end-users, and macroeconomic conditions. While we believe seasonality may be a factor that impacts our quarterly net sales results, we are not able to reliably predict net sales based on seasonality because these other factors can also substantially impact our net sales patterns during the year. We also believe net sales may not follow this trend in periods when overall economic conditions in the industry and/or in the world are atypical. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying condensed notes that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 22 Table of Contents Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017 provides a summary of our significant accounting policies. Those significant accounting policies detailed in our fiscal year 2017 Form 10-K did not change during the period from November 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018. New Accounting Standards In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that expands disclosure requirements and requires an entity to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (“ASU 2015-14”) which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. Under ASU 2015-14, the new revenue recognition standard is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2019. The FASB has also issued ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11, ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-20, and ASU 2017-14 all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance, but do not anticipate that the adoption will significantly change the timing or amount of revenue recognized. Therefore, we believe the adoption will be limited to expanded disclosures with no material impact on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 requires the recognition of a separate lease liability representing the required lease payments over the lease term and a separate lease asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the same lease term. Additionally, this ASU provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease as well as requires additional disclosures to the notes of the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-02 in order to determine the impact on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity and our related financial statement disclosures. We expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 may result in an increase to our long-term assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet depending on the resulting impact of any decision by us to renew, extend or replace our two existing real estate leases, as the current leases expire; however, we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity and our related financial statement disclosures. In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The pronouncement provides clarification guidance on eight specific cash flow presentation issues that have developed due to diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity or our related financial statement disclosures. 23 Table of Contents In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”). ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset (with the exception of inventory) when the transfer occurs.  Under current GAAP, entities are prohibited from recognizing current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer until the asset is sold to a third party.  Examples of assets that would be affected by the new guidance are intellectual property and property, plant and equipment.  ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-16 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity or our related financial statement disclosures. There are no other new accounting standards issued, but not yet adopted by us, which are expected to be applicable to our financial position, operating results or financial statement disclosures. 24","","","Item 4. Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2018. Based on this evaluation process, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2018, and that there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 25 Table of Contents","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000230/0001437749-18-004449-index.html"

tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) 1. Principles of Consolidation These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. We believe that we have included all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period. Operating results for the quarter ended December 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending September 29, 2018. Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior-year financial statements to conform to the current-year presentation. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company enters into relationships or investments with other entities that may be a variable interest entity (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (collectively the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements. The terms ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" and ""our"" are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which our various businesses are actually conducted. 2. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet to the total of the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. December 30,  2017   September 30,  2017 Cash and cash equivalents   $ 4,677     $ 4,017   Restricted cash included in:         Other current assets   13     26   Other assets   5     21   Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows   $ 4,695     $ 4,064 3. Segment Information The operating segments reported below are the segments of the Company for which separate financial information is available and for which results are evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Segment operating results reflect earnings before corporate and unallocated shared expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, other income, interest expense, income taxes and noncontrolling interests. Segment operating income includes equity in the income of investees. Corporate and unallocated shared expenses principally consist of corporate functions, executive management and certain unallocated administrative support functions. 7 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) Equity in the income of investees is included in segment operating income as follows: Quarter Ended   December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016 Media Networks $ 50     $ 119   Parks and Resorts (7 )   (2 ) Consumer Products & Interactive Media  -      1   Equity in the income of investees included in segment operating income $ 43     $ 118 Segment revenues and segment operating income are as follows: Quarter Ended   December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016 Revenues (1):       Media Networks $ 6,243     $ 6,233   Parks and Resorts 5,154     4,555   Studio Entertainment 2,504     2,520   Consumer Products & Interactive Media 1,450     1,476     $ 15,351     $ 14,784   Segment operating income (1):       Media Networks $ 1,193     $ 1,362   Parks and Resorts 1,347     1,110   Studio Entertainment 829     842   Consumer Products & Interactive Media 617     642     $ 3,986     $ 3,956 (1) Studio Entertainment revenues and operating income include an allocation of Consumer Products & Interactive Media revenues, which is meant to reflect royalties on sales of merchandise based on film properties. The increase to Studio Entertainment revenues and operating income and corresponding decrease to Consumer Products & Interactive Media revenues and operating income was $171 million and $181 million for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. A reconciliation of segment operating income to income before income taxes is as follows: Quarter Ended   December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016 Segment operating income $ 3,986     $ 3,956   Corporate and unallocated shared expenses (150 )   (132 ) Restructuring and impairment charges (15 )    -    Other income, net 53      -    Interest expense, net (129 )   (99 ) Income before income taxes $ 3,745     $ 3,725 4. Acquisitions BAMTech On September 25, 2017, the Company acquired an additional 42% interest in BAMTech, a streaming technology and content delivery business, from an affiliate of Major League Baseball (MLB) for $1.6 billion (paid in January 2018). The acquisition increased our interest from 33% to 75%, and as a result, we began consolidating BAMTech during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The estimated acquisition date fair value of BAMTech is $3.9 billion. 8 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) BAMTech's noncontrolling interest holders, MLB and the National Hockey League (NHL), have the right to sell their shares to the Company in the future. MLB can generally sell their shares to the Company starting five years from and ending ten years after the September 25, 2017 acquisition date at the greater of fair value or a guaranteed floor value ($563 million accreting at 8% annually for eight years). The NHL can sell their shares to the Company in fiscal 2020 for $300 million or in fiscal 2021 for $350 million. Accordingly, these interests are recorded as ""Redeemable noncontrolling interests"" in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has the right to purchase MLB's interest in BAMTech starting five years from and ending ten years after the acquisition date at the greater of fair value or the guaranteed floor value. The Company has the right to acquire the NHL interest in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 for $500 million. The acquisition date fair value of the noncontrolling interests was estimated at $1.1 billion and calculated using an option pricing model. The MLB noncontrolling interest fair value generally reflects the net present value of MLB's guaranteed floor value, while the NHL noncontrolling interest reflects their share of the $3.9 billion BAMTech value. As a result of the MLB and NHL sale rights, the noncontrolling interests will generally not be allocated BAMTech losses. Prospectively, the Company will record the noncontrolling interests at the greater of (i) their acquisition date fair value adjusted for their share (if any) of earnings, losses, or dividends or (ii) an accreted value from the date of the acquisition to the earliest redemption date. The accretion of the MLB interest to the earliest redemption value in five years after the acquisition date will be recorded using an interest method. As of December 30, 2017, the redeemable noncontrolling interest subject to accretion would have had a redemption amount of $574 million if it were redeemed at that time. Adjustments to the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests will increase or decrease income available to Company shareholders through an adjustment to ""Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests"" on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company is negotiating to provide the noncontrolling interest holder in ESPN a portion of the Company's share of the BAMTech direct-to-consumer sports business at a price that is consistent with the amount the Company invested. If such transaction is finalized, their investment would be recorded as a noncontrolling interest transaction when consummated. We have preliminarily allocated $3.6 billion of the purchase price to goodwill (approximately half of which is deductible for tax purposes) with the remainder primarily allocated to identifiable intangible assets. We are in the process of finalizing the valuation of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities, and noncontrolling interests. The revenue and costs of BAMTech included in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the quarter ended December 30, 2017 were both approximately $0.1 billion. Twenty-First Century Fox On December 14, 2017, the Company and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (""21CF"") announced a definitive agreement (the ""Merger Agreement"") for the Company to acquire 21CF. Prior to the acquisition, 21CF will separate certain of its businesses, most notably, the FOX Broadcasting network and stations, FOX News Channel, FOX Business Network, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network into a newly listed company (""New Fox"") that will be spun off to 21CF shareholders. Prior to the spin-off, New Fox will pay a dividend to 21CF in the amount of $8.5 billion. Following the spin-off, the significant remaining businesses will include the 21CF film and television studios, certain cable networks (including FX and National Geographic) and 21CF's international TV businesses. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, shareholders of 21CF will receive 0.2745 of a Company share for each 21CF share they hold subject to a two-way adjustment based on an estimate at closing of certain tax liabilities arising from the spin-off and certain other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In the event that the final estimate of tax liabilities is lower than the estimate used to set the exchange ratio, the first $2.0 billion of that adjustment will be made by a net reduction in the amount of cash dividend to 21CF from New Fox. Based upon 21CF shares outstanding as of September 30, 2017, the Company would be required to issue approximately 515 million new shares, a value of approximately $52.4 billion at the time the exchange ratio was agreed. The value at which the Company will record the equity consideration will be based upon the stock price on the date the transaction closes. In addition, the Company will assume 21CF's net debt, which was approximately $13.7 billion as of September 30, 2017 (approximately $20.0 billion of debt less approximately $6.3 billion in cash). The Boards of Directors of the Company and 21CF have approved the transaction, which is also subject to approval by 21CF and the Company's shareholders, clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, a number of other non-United States merger and other regulatory reviews, the receipt of a tax ruling from the Australian Taxation Office and certain tax opinions with respect to the treatment of the transaction under U.S. and Australian tax laws, and other customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Disney will pay 21CF $2.5 billion if the merger is not consummated under certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain approvals, or if there is a final, non-appealable order preventing the 9 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) transaction, in each case, relating to antitrust laws, communications laws or foreign regulatory laws. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain other circumstances relating to changes in board recommendations and/or alternative transactions, the Company or 21CF may be required to pay the other party approximately $1.5 billion. Goodwill The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the quarter ended December 30, 2017 are as follows: Media Networks   Parks and Resorts   Studio Entertainment   Consumer Products & Interactive Media   Unallocated (1)   Total Balance at Sept. 30, 2017 $ 16,325     $ 291     $ 6,817     $ 4,393     $ 3,600     $ 31,426   Acquisitions  -       -       -       -       -       -    Dispositions  -       -       -       -       -       -    Other, net 7      -      7     2     (12 )   4   Balance at Dec. 30, 2017 $ 16,332     $ 291     $ 6,824     $ 4,395     $ 3,588     $ 31,430 (1) Goodwill will be allocated to the segments once the BAMTech purchase price allocation is finalized. 5. Borrowings During the quarter ended December 30, 2017, the Company's borrowing activity was as follows: September 30,  2017   Borrowings   Payments   Other Activity   December 30,  2017 Commercial paper with original maturities less than three months(1) $ 1,151     $ 2,047     $  -      $  -      $ 3,198   Commercial paper with original maturities greater than three months 1,621     712     (1,619 )   (1 )   713   U.S. and European medium-term notes 19,721      -      (1,300 )   6     18,427   BAMTech acquisition payable 1,581      -       -       -      1,581   Asia Theme Parks borrowings 1,145      -       -      30     1,175   Foreign currency denominated debt and other(2) 72     1,025     (30 )   (70 )   997   Total $ 25,291     $ 3,784     $ (2,949 )   $ (35 )   $ 26,091 (1) Borrowings and payments are reported net. (2) The other activity is primarily market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges. The Company has bank facilities with a syndicate of lenders to support commercial paper borrowings as follows: Committed Capacity   Capacity Used   Unused Capacity Facility expiring March 2018 $ 2,500     $  -      $ 2,500   Facility expiring March 2019 2,250      -      2,250   Facility expiring March 2021 2,250      -      2,250   Total $ 7,000     $  -      $ 7,000 All of the above bank facilities allow for borrowings at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread depending on the credit default swap spread applicable to the Company's debt, subject to a cap and floor that vary with the Company's debt rating assigned by Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's. The spread above LIBOR can range from 0.23% to 1.63%. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in March 2019, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has $190 million of outstanding letters of credit, of which none were issued under this facility. The facilities specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks and Disneyland Paris, from any representations, covenants, or events of default and contain only one financial covenant relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on December 30, 2017 by a significant margin. 10 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) Cruise Ship Credit Facilities In October 2016 and December 2017 the Company entered into credit facilities to finance three new cruise ships, which are expected to be delivered in 2021, 2022 and 2023. The financings may be used for up to 80% of the contract price of the cruise ships. Under the agreements, $1.0 billion in financing is available beginning in April 2021, $1.1 billion is available beginning in May 2022 and $1.1 billion is available beginning in April 2023. If utilized, the interest rates will be fixed at 3.48%, 3.72% and 3.74%, respectively, and the loan and interest will be payable semi-annually over a 12-year period from the borrowing date. Early repayment is permitted subject to cancellation fees.

The majority of cash flows used in investing activities were for the Asia Theme Parks. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the Company have 53% and 47% equity interests in Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, respectively. As part of financing the construction of a third hotel, which opened April 30, 2017, the Company and HKSAR have provided loans with outstanding balances of $139 million and $93 million, respectively, which bear interest at a rate of three month HIBOR plus 2% and mature in September 2025. The Company's loan is eliminated upon consolidation. The Company has provided Hong Kong Disneyland Resort with a revolving credit facility of HK $2.1 billion ($269 million), which bears interest at a rate of three month HIBOR plus 1.25% and matures in December 2023. There is no outstanding balance under the line of credit at December 30, 2017. In August 2017, the Company and HKSAR entered into an agreement for a multi-year expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland that will add a number of new guest offerings, including two new themed areas, by 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, the HK $10.9 billion ($1.4 billion) expansion will be funded by equity contributions made by the Company and HKSAR on an equal basis. Shanghai Disney Resort Shanghai Shendi (Group) Co., Ltd (Shendi) and the Company have 57% and 43% equity interests in Shanghai Disney Resort, respectively. A management company, in which the Company has a 70% interest and Shendi a 30% interest, is responsible for operating Shanghai Disney Resort. The Company has provided Shanghai Disney Resort with loans totaling $789 million, bearing interest at rates up to 8% and maturing in 2036, with early repayment permitted. In addition, the Company has an outstanding balance of $322 million due from Shanghai Disney Resort related to development costs, pre-opening expense and royalties and management fees. The Company has also provided Shanghai Disney Resort with a $157 million line of credit bearing interest at 8%. There is no outstanding balance under the line of credit at December 30, 2017. These balances are eliminated upon consolidation. Shendi has provided Shanghai Disney Resort with loans totaling 6.8 billion yuan (approximately $1.0 billion), bearing interest at rates up to 8% and maturing in 2036, with early repayment permitted. Shendi has also provided Shanghai Disney Resort with a 1.4 billion yuan (approximately $209 million) line of credit bearing interest at 8%. There is no outstanding balance under the line of credit at December 30, 2017. 7. Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, new federal income tax legislation, the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (Tax Act), was signed into law. The most significant impacts on the Company are as follows: • Effective January 1, 2018, the U.S. corporate federal statutory income tax rate was reduced from 35.0% to 21.0%. Because of our fiscal year end, the Company's fiscal 2018 statutory federal tax rate is 24.5%, which is applicable to each quarter of the fiscal year, and will be 21.0% thereafter. • The Company remeasured its existing U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the rate that the Company expects to be in effect when those deferred taxes will be realized (either 24.5% if in 2018 or 21.0% thereafter). The 12 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) Company recognized a one-time benefit from the deferred tax remeasurement of approximately $1.9 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. • A one-time tax is due on certain accumulated foreign earnings (Deemed Repatriation Tax), which is payable over eight years. The tax rate is generally 15.5% on the portion of the earnings held in cash and cash equivalents and 8% on the remainder. The Company recognized a charge for the Deemed Repatriation Tax of approximately $0.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Generally there will no longer be a U.S. federal income tax cost arising from the repatriation of foreign earnings. • The Company will be eligible to claim an immediate deduction for investments in qualified fixed assets and film and television productions placed in service in fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. This provision phases out through fiscal 2027. • The domestic production activity deduction was eliminated effective for the Company's fiscal 2019. • Certain foreign derived income will be taxed in the U.S. at an effective rate of approximately 13% (which increases to approximately 16% in 2025) rather than the general statutory rate of 21%. This will be effective for the Company in fiscal 2019. • Certain foreign earnings will be taxed at a minimum effective rate of approximately 13%. This will be effective for the Company in fiscal 2019. The amounts that the Company has recorded are provisional estimates of the impact the Tax Act will have on the Company's financial statements in fiscal 2018. Additional information and analysis is required to finalize the impact that the Tax Act will have on our full year financial results including the following: • Filing the fiscal 2017 U.S. federal income tax return, which could impact our estimated foreign earnings and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, • Finalizing the determination of foreign cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2018, which is required to calculate the Deemed Repatriation Tax, and • Receiving additional information with respect to the income tax attributes of our equity method investments. Although the Company does not anticipate material adjustments to the provisional amounts, final results could vary from these provisional amounts. Additionally, potential further guidance may be forthcoming from the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as regulations, interpretations and rulings from federal and state tax agencies, which could result in additional impacts. During the quarter ended December 30, 2017, the Company increased its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $0.1 billion to $0.9 billion. In the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could change due to resolutions of open tax matters. These resolutions would reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $258 million, of which $100 million would reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate if recognized. 8. Pension and Other Benefit Programs The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: Pension Plans   Postretirement Medical Plans   Quarter Ended   Quarter Ended   December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016   December 30, 2017   December 31, 2016 Service costs $ 88     $ 91     $ 3     $ 3   Interest costs 123     112     15     14   Expected return on plan assets (225 )   (219 )   (13 )   (12 ) Amortization of prior-year service costs 3     3      -       -    Recognized net actuarial loss 87     101     3     4   Net periodic benefit cost $ 76     $ 88     $ 8     $ 9 During the quarter ended December 30, 2017, the Company did not make any material contributions to its pension and postretirement medical plans and currently does not expect to make any material contributions to its pension and postretirement medical plans during the remainder of fiscal 2018. However, final funding amounts for fiscal 2018 will be assessed based on our January 1, 2018 funding actuarial valuation, which will be available by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 13 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) 9. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period and are calculated using the treasury stock method for equity-based compensation awards (Awards). A reconciliation of the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding and the number of Awards excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as they were anti-dilutive, are as follows: Quarter Ended   December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016 Shares (in millions):       Weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding (basic) 1,512     1,592   Weighted average dilutive impact of Awards 9     11   Weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding (diluted) 1,521     1,603   Awards excluded from diluted earnings per share 16     16 10.

Equity-Based Compensation Compensation expense related to stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units (RSUs) is as follows: Quarter Ended   December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016 Stock options $ 23     $ 20   RSUs 71     77   Total equity-based compensation expense (1) $ 94     $ 97   Equity-based compensation expense capitalized during the period $ 19     $ 21 (1) Equity-based compensation expense is net of capitalized equity-based compensation and excludes amortization of previously capitalized equity-based compensation costs. Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and RSUs was $222 million and $858 million, respectively, as of December 30, 2017. The weighted average grant date fair values of options granted during the quarter ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $28.01 and $25.78, respectively. During the quarter ended December 30, 2017, the Company made equity compensation grants consisting of 4.0 million stock options and 4.1 million RSUs. 12. Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters The Company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant or codefendant in various legal actions involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. Management does not believe that the Company has incurred a probable material loss by reason of any of those actions. Contractual Guarantees The Company has guaranteed bond issuances by the Anaheim Public Authority that were used by the City of Anaheim to finance construction of infrastructure and a public parking facility adjacent to the Disneyland Resort. Revenues from sales, occupancy and property taxes from the Disneyland Resort and non-Disney hotels are used by the City of Anaheim to repay the bonds. In the event of a debt service shortfall, the Company will be responsible to fund the shortfall. As of December 30, 2017, the remaining debt service obligation guaranteed by the Company was $306 million, of which $48 million was principal. To the extent that tax revenues exceed the debt service payments in subsequent periods, the Company would be reimbursed for any previously funded shortfalls. To date, tax revenues have exceeded the debt service payments for these bonds. 16 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) The Company has guaranteed $113 million of Hulu LLC's $338 million term loan, which expires in August 2022, and is committed to make a capital contribution of approximately $450 million to Hulu in calendar 2018. Hulu is a joint venture in which the Company has a 30% ownership interest. Long-Term Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses The Company has accounts receivable with original maturities greater than one year related to the sale of television program rights and vacation ownership units. Allowances for credit losses are established against these receivables as necessary. The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses related to receivables from the sale of television programs based upon a number of factors, including historical experience and the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. The balance of television program sales receivables recorded in other non-current assets, net of an immaterial allowance for credit losses, was $0.8 billion as of December 30, 2017. The activity in the current period related to the allowance for credit losses was not material. The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses related to receivables from sales of its vacation ownership units based primarily on historical collection experience. Estimates of uncollectible amounts also consider the economic environment and the age of receivables. The balance of mortgage receivables recorded in other non-current assets, net of a related allowance for credit losses of approximately 4%, was approximately $0.7 billion as of December 30, 2017. The activity in the current period related to the allowance for credit losses was not material. 13. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and is generally classified in one of the following categories of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable The Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value are summarized in the following tables by fair value measurement Level: Fair Value Measurement at December 30, 2017   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total Assets                Investments $ 32     $  -      $  -      $ 32   Derivatives               Foreign exchange  -      416      -      416   Other  -      13      -      13   Liabilities               Derivatives               Interest rate  -      (188 )    -      (188 ) Foreign exchange  -      (459 )    -      (459 ) Total recorded at fair value $ 32     $ (218 )   $  -      $ (186 ) Fair value of borrowings $  -      $ 23,935     $ 2,793     $ 26,728 17 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) Fair Value Measurement at September 30, 2017   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Total Assets                Investments $ 36     $  -      $  -      $ 36   Derivatives               Interest rate  -      10      -      10   Foreign exchange  -      403      -      403   Other  -      8      -      8   Liabilities               Derivatives               Interest rate  -      (122 )    -      (122 ) Foreign exchange  -      (427 )    -      (427 ) Total recorded at fair value $ 36     $ (128 )   $  -      $ (92 ) Fair value of borrowings $  -      $ 23,110     $ 2,764     $ 25,874 The fair values of Level 2 derivatives are primarily determined by internal discounted cash flow models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency exchange rates. Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, did not have a material impact on derivative fair value estimates. Level 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper and U.S. medium-term notes, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Level 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings and the Company's other foreign currency denominated borrowings, and generally are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks and the Company, respectively, as well as historical market transactions and prevailing market interest rates. The Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values. 14. Derivative Instruments The Company manages its exposure to various risks relating to its ongoing business operations according to a risk management policy. The primary risks managed with derivative instruments are interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Company's derivative positions measured at fair value are summarized in the following tables: As of December 30, 2017   Current Assets   Other Assets   Other Current Liabilities   Other Long- Term Liabilities Derivatives designated as hedges               Foreign exchange $ 152     $ 237     $ (187 )   $ (184 ) Interest rate  -       -      (161 )    -    Other 11     2      -       -    Derivatives not designated as hedges               Foreign exchange 24     3     (64 )   (25 ) Interest rate  -       -       -      (27 ) Gross fair value of derivatives 187     242     (412 )   (236 ) Counterparty netting (141 )   (238 )   204     175   Cash collateral (received)/paid (12 )   (1 )   35      -    Net derivative positions  $ 34     $ 3     $ (173 )   $ (61 ) 18 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) As of September 30, 2017   Current Assets   Other Assets   Other Current Liabilities   Other Long- Term Liabilities Derivatives designated as hedges               Foreign exchange $ 175     $ 190     $ (192 )   $ (170 ) Interest rate  -      10     (106 )    -    Other 6     2      -       -    Derivatives not designated as hedges               Foreign exchange 38      -      (46 )   (19 ) Interest rate  -       -       -      (16 ) Gross fair value of derivatives 219     202     (344 )   (205 ) Counterparty netting (142 )   (190 )   188     144   Cash collateral (received)/paid (20 )   (7 )   19      -    Net derivative positions  $ 57     $ 5     $ (137 )   $ (61 ) Interest Rate Risk Management The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through its borrowing activities. The Company's objective is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and on the market value of its borrowings. In accordance with its policy, the Company targets its fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage. The Company primarily uses pay-floating and pay-fixed interest rate swaps to facilitate its interest rate risk management activities. The Company designates pay-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings effectively converting fixed-rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to LIBOR. As of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, the total notional amount of the Company's pay-floating interest rate swaps was $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes adjustments related to fair value hedges included in ""Interest expense, net"" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Quarter Ended   December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016 Gain (loss) on interest rate swaps $ (64 )   $ (232 ) Gain (loss) on hedged borrowings 64     232 In addition, the Company realized net benefits of $7 million and $12 million for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, in ""Interest expense, net"" related to pay-floating interest rate swaps. The Company may designate pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest expense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at December 30, 2017 or at September 30, 2017 and gains and losses related to pay-fixed swaps recognized in earnings for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were not material. To facilitate its interest rate risk management activities, the Company sold an option in November 2016 to enter into a future pay-floating interest rate swap indexed to LIBOR for $0.5 billion in future borrowings. The fair value of this contract as of December 30, 2017 was not material. In October 2017, the Company sold an additional option for $0.5 billion in future borrowings with the same terms. The options are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting; accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. Foreign Exchange Risk Management The Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes, enabling management to focus on core business issues and challenges. 19 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) The Company enters into option and forward contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and British pound. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. The Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $6.7 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Gains and losses recognized related to ineffectiveness for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were not material. Net deferred losses recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months totaled $64 million. Foreign exchange risk management contracts with respect to foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts at December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 were $2.9 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes the net foreign exchange gains or losses recognized on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the net foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate our exposure with respect to foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 by the corresponding line item in which they are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income: Costs and Expenses   Interest expense, net   Income Tax expense Quarter Ended: December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016 Net gains (losses) on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities $ 17     $ (233 )   $ 3     $ 7     $ 3     $ 23   Net gains (losses) on foreign exchange risk management contracts not designated as hedges (14 )   221     (1 )   (7 )   (1 )   (31 ) Net gains (losses) $ 3     $ (12 )   $ 2     $  -      $ 2     $ (8 ) Commodity Price Risk Management The Company is subject to the volatility of commodities prices and the Company designates certain commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of commodity purchases. The notional amount of these commodities contracts at December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 and related gains or losses recognized in earnings for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were not material. Risk Management  -  Other Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges The Company enters into certain other risk management contracts that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. These contracts, which include certain swap contracts, are intended to offset economic exposures of the Company and are carried at market value with any changes in value recorded in earnings. The notional amount and fair value of these contracts at December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 were not material. The related gains or losses recognized in earnings for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were not material. Contingent Features and Cash Collateral The Company has master netting arrangements by counterparty with respect to certain derivative financial instrument contracts. The Company may be required to post collateral in the event that a net liability position with a counterparty exceeds limits defined by contract and that vary with the Company's credit rating. In addition, these contracts may require a counterparty to post collateral to the Company in the event that a net receivable position with a counterparty exceeds limits defined by contract and that vary with the counterparty's credit rating. If the Company's or the counterparty's credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, such counterparties or the Company would also have the right to terminate our derivative contracts, which could lead to a net payment to or from the Company for the aggregate net value by counterparty of our derivative contracts. The aggregate fair values of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a net 20 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) liability position by counterparty were $269 million and $217 million on December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively. 15. Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Other Income The Company recorded $15 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the current quarter primarily consisting of severance costs. The Company recorded a $53 million gain in the current quarter on the sale of property rights. 16. New Accounting Pronouncements Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to improve certain aspects of the hedge accounting model including making more risk management strategies eligible for hedge accounting and simplifying the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We do not expect the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as our historical hedging ineffectiveness has been immaterial. The new guidance is effective beginning with the Company's 2020 fiscal year (with early adoption permitted in any interim period) and requires prospective adoption with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption for existing hedging relationships. Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance that requires presentation of all components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service costs, in an income statement line item outside of a subtotal of income from operations. The service cost component will continue to be presented in the same line items as other employee compensation costs. In addition, the guidance allows only service costs to be eligible for capitalization, for example, as part of a self-constructed fixed asset or a film production. The new guidance is effective beginning with the first quarter of the Company's 2019 fiscal year. The guidance is required to be adopted retrospectively with respect to income statement presentation and prospectively for the capitalization requirement. We do not expect the change in capitalization requirement to have a material impact on our financial statements. See Note 8 of this filing and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the amount of each component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs we have reported historically. These amounts of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are not necessarily indicative of future amounts that may arise in years following implementation of the new accounting pronouncement. Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory to be recognized when the transfer occurs instead of when the asset is sold to an outside party. The new guidance is effective beginning with the first quarter of the Company's 2019 fiscal year. The guidance requires prospective adoption with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. We currently estimate that we will record approximately $0.1 billion as an increase to retained earnings upon adoption. Our assessment may change if we enter into new transactions between now and the date of adoption. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued a new lease accounting standard, which requires the present value of committed operating lease payments to be recorded as right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had an estimated $3.3 billion in undiscounted future minimum lease commitments. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new guidance on its financial statements. The guidance is required to be adopted retrospectively, and is effective beginning in the first quarter of the Company's 2020 fiscal year (with early adoption permitted). The FASB has recently proposed guidance that would allow adoption of the standard as of the effective date without restating prior periods. Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance that replaces the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition with a single comprehensive five-step model, eliminating industry-specific accounting rules. The core principle is to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received. Since its issuance, the FASB has amended several aspects of the new guidance, including provisions that address revenue recognition associated with the licensing of intellectual property (IP). The new guidance, including the amendments, is effective at the beginning of the Company's 2019 fiscal year. 21 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data) We have reviewed our significant revenue streams and identified required changes to our revenue recognition policies. Based on our existing customer contracts and relationships, we do not expect the implementation of the new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company's evaluation of the impact could change if we enter into new revenue arrangements in the future or interpretations of the new guidance further evolve. While not expected to be material, the more significant changes to the Company's revenue recognition policies are in the following areas: • For television and film content licensing agreements with multiple availability windows with the same licensee, the Company will defer more revenues to future windows than is currently deferred. • For licenses of character images, brands and trademarks subject to minimum guaranteed license fees, we currently recognize the difference between the minimum guaranteed amount and actual royalties earned from licensee merchandise sales (""shortfalls"") at the end of the contract period. Under the new guidance, projected guarantee shortfalls will be recognized straight-line over the remaining license period once an expected shortfall is identified. • For licenses that include multiple television and film titles subject to minimum guaranteed license fees that are recoupable against the licensee's aggregate underlying sales from all titles, the Company will allocate the minimum guaranteed license fee to each title and recognize the allocated license fee as revenue when the title is made available to the customer. License fees in excess of the allocated by-title minimum guarantee are deferred until the aggregate contractual minimum guarantee has been exceeded and thereafter recognized as earned based on the licensee's underlying sales. Under current guidance, an upfront allocation of the minimum guarantee is not required as license fees are recognized as earned based on the licensee's underlying sales with any shortfalls recognized at the end of the contract period. • For renewals or extensions of license agreements for television and film content, we will recognize revenue when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension, instead of when the agreement is renewed or extended. We are continuing our assessment of potential changes to our disclosures and internal controls under the new guidance. The guidance may be adopted either by restating all years presented in the Company's financial statements for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 (full retrospective method) or by recording the impact of adoption as an adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2019 (modified retrospective method). The Company currently expects to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method. The Company's equity method investees are considered private companies for purposes of applying the new guidance and are not required to adopt the new standard until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We have not yet assessed the impact of the new rules on our equity investees. 22 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS","ITEM 1A. Risk Factors The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act) provides a safe harbor for ""forward-looking statements"" made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are ""forward-looking,"" including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our shareholders. All forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update its disclosure relating to forward-looking matters. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such differences may result from actions taken by the Company, including restructuring or strategic initiatives (including capital investments or asset acquisitions or dispositions), as well as from developments beyond the Company's control, including: changes in domestic and global economic conditions, competitive conditions and consumer preferences; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters; health concerns; international, political or military developments; and technological developments. Such developments may affect entertainment, travel and leisure businesses generally and may, among other things, affect the performance of the Company's theatrical and home entertainment releases, the advertising market for broadcast and cable television programming, demand for our products and services, expenses of providing medical and pension benefits and performance of some or all company businesses either directly or through their impact on those who distribute our products. Additional factors are discussed in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" Risk Factors Related to the Acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox (""21CF"") The proposed Acquisition of 21CF may cause disruption in our business. The merger agreement related to the acquisition of 21CF (the ""Acquisition"") restricts us from taking certain specified actions without 21CF's consent until the Acquisition is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, including making certain acquisitions and paying dividends in excess of certain thresholds. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The proposed Acquisition could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties. The pursuit of the Acquisition and the preparation for the integration of 21CF may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management's attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Acquisition. We may also incur unanticipated costs in the integration of the businesses of 21CF and Disney.  The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the Acquisition, and many of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the Acquisition is consummated. We also could be subject to litigation related to the proposed Acquisition, which could result in significant costs and expenses. Failure to complete the Acquisition in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, as well as our future business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We currently anticipate the Acquisition will be completed within 12 to 18 months after December 13, 2017, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions for the Acquisition will be satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived. The Acquisition cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived, including (i) the adoption of the merger agreement by the requisite vote of the 21CF stockholders and the approval of the stock issuance by the requisite vote of Disney stockholders, (ii) receipt of certain required governmental approvals and consents, (iii) receipt by 21CF of a surplus and solvency opinion with respect to the separation of the 21CF assets and liabilities that we are not acquiring in the Acquisition, referred to as the separation, and the cash dividend in connection with the Acquisition, (iv) effectiveness of registration statements with respect to the issuance of Disney shares in connection with the Acquisition and the 40 registration of the common stock of a newly formed subsidiary of 21CF, referred to as New Fox, that is contemplated to own the 21CF assets and liabilities that we are not acquiring in the Acquisition and which will be spun off to 21CF stockholders, (v) authorization of Disney and New Fox shares for listing on NYSE or NASDAQ, as applicable, (vi) the consummation of the separation and spin off of New Fox to 21CF stockholders, (vii) receipt by Disney of a tax ruling from the Australian Taxation Office, (viii) receipt of certain tax opinions by each of 21CF and Disney, including a tax opinion regarding the tax-free treatment of the Acquisition to the 21CF stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (ix) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by 21CF or Disney, as applicable, in the merger agreement. Our obligation to complete the Acquisition is also subject to, among other conditions, the absence of regulatory authorities requiring certain actions on our part. The satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the Acquisition will be completed. If the Acquisition is not completed in a timely manner or at all, our ongoing business may be adversely affected as follows: • we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, and our stock price could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the transaction will be completed; • we may experience negative reactions from employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties; • management's focus may have been diverted from pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Disney; and • our costs of pursuing the Acquisition may be higher than anticipated. In addition to the above risks, we may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay 21CF a termination fee equal to $1.525 billion, or in connection with a termination under certain specified circumstances in connection with the failure to obtain regulatory approvals, $2.5 billion. If the Acquisition is not consummated, there can be no assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our stock price, business, financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows. The Acquisition may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. We currently expect the Acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share, excluding the impact of purchase accounting, for the second fiscal year after closing. This expectation, however, is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, we could fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Acquisition or experience delays or inefficiencies in realizing such benefits. Such factors could, combined with the issuance of 0.2745 shares of our common stock for each share of the common stock of 21CF, subject to adjustment for certain tax liabilities, result in the Acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. In order to complete the Acquisition, Disney and 21CF must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions, completion of the Acquisition may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition could be reduced. Although Disney and 21CF have agreed to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings and obtain the required governmental approvals or expiration or earlier termination of relevant waiting periods, as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or be terminated or that the relevant approvals will be obtained. As a condition to approving the Acquisition, these governmental authorities may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the Acquisition. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Acquisition or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Acquisition, or otherwise adversely affecting, including to a material extent, our businesses and results of operations after completion of the Acquisition. If we or 21CF are required to divest assets or businesses, there can be no assurance that we or 21CF will be able to negotiate such divestitures expeditiously or on favorable terms or that the governmental authorities will approve the terms of such divestitures. We can provide no assurance that these conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the abandonment of the Acquisition. Although we expect that the Acquisition will result in synergies and other benefits to us, we may not realize those benefits because of difficulties related to integration, the achievement of synergies, and other challenges. Disney and 21CF have operated and, until completion of the Acquisition, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that our businesses can be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of substantial 41 benefits. If we are not able to successfully integrate 21CF's businesses with ours or pursue our direct-to-consumer strategy successfully, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized. Further, it is possible that there could be loss of key Disney or 21CF employees, loss of customers, disruption of either company's or both companies' ongoing businesses or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall post-completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in combining the operations of Disney and 21CF in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition so the combined company performs as the parties hope: • combining the companies' corporate functions; • combining the businesses of Disney and 21CF in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the Acquisition, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all; • maintaining existing agreements with customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors; • determining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies; • integrating the companies' administrative and information technology infrastructure; • developing products and technology that allow value to be unlocked in the future; and • effecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on completion of the Acquisition and integration planning of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our ongoing business and the business of the combined company. Consummation of the Acquisition will increase our exposure to the risks of operating internationally. We are a diversified entertainment company that offers entertainment, travel and consumer products worldwide. Although many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside of the U.S., the combination with 21CF will increase the importance of international operations to our future operations, growth and prospects. The risks of operating internationally that we already face may therefore be exacerbated upon completion of the Acquisition. Our consolidated indebtedness will increase substantially following completion of the Acquisition. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility. Our consolidated indebtedness as of September 30, 2017 was approximately $25 billion. Upon completion of the Acquisition, we will assume an estimated $20 billion of additional outstanding debt of 21CF if the Sky acquisition is completed. The increased indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels will increase following completion of the Acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than prior to the Acquisition. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the Acquisition could also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends, and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Our funds on hand will be further constrained by the issuance of shares of our common stock in the acquisition, because of dividend payments on our common stock, which, as of the date of this filing, were $0.84 per share of our common stock on a semi-annual basis. 42","Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION Management's Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative of the Company's financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements.

The net income and EPS increase for the quarter was due to the benefit of new federal income tax legislation, the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (Tax Act) (See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). EPS for the quarter also benefited from a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. Segment operating income in the current quarter was comparable to the prior-year quarter, as growth at our Parks and Resorts segment was largely offset by lower results at our Media Networks segment. Revenues Service revenues for the quarter increased 5%, or $578 million, to $13.0 billion due to higher guest spending and attendance at our parks and resorts, higher theatrical distribution revenue, an increase in affiliate fees and revenue from BAMTech, which is now consolidated. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Product revenues for the quarter were flat at $2.4 billion as higher guest spending and attendance at our parks and resorts were offset by lower volumes at our home entertainment business. Costs and expenses Cost of services for the quarter increased 4%, or $314 million, to $7.3 billion primarily due to higher costs at our parks and resorts, increased production cost write-downs and higher film cost amortization due to higher theatrical revenue. The increase at parks and resorts was driven by cost inflation, higher volumes and new guest offerings. Cost of products for the quarter increased 1%, or $17 million, to $1.4 billion driven by higher volumes and inflation at our parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased 5%, or $94 million, to $2.1 billion due to the consolidation of BAMTech, costs incurred in connection with our agreement to acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. and higher marketing spend. Depreciation and amortization increased 8%, or $55 million, to $0.7 billion, primarily due to depreciation of new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts and the consolidation of BAMTech. Restructuring and impairment charges The Company recorded $15 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the quarter primarily consisting of severance costs. Other income, net The Company recorded a $53 million gain in the quarter on the sale of property rights. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net is as follows: Quarter Ended     (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   % Change Better/(Worse) Interest expense $ (146 )   $ (121 )   (21)   % Interest and investment income 17     22     (23)   % Interest expense, net $ (129 )   $ (99 )   (30)   % The increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances and an increase in average interest rates. The decrease in interest and investment income was due to an investment write-down in the current quarter. Equity in the income of investees Equity in the income of investees decreased $75 million to $43 million for the quarter due to higher losses from our investment in Hulu and lower operating results from A+E Television Networks (A+E), partially offset by the absence of equity losses from BAMTech, which is now consolidated and reported in the Media Networks segment. The decrease at Hulu was due to higher programming and labor costs, partially offset by subscription and advertising revenue growth. The decrease at A+E was due to lower advertising revenue, higher marketing costs and increased programming costs. 24 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) Effective Income Tax Rate Quarter Ended       December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Change Better/(Worse) Effective income tax rate (benefit) / expense (19.4 )%   33.2 %   52.6   ppt For the current quarter, we recognized an income tax benefit compared to expense in the prior-year quarter. The 52.6 percentage point change in our effective tax rate compared to the prior-year quarter reflected two significant impacts of the Tax Act: • A one-time net benefit of approximately $1.6 billion, which reflected an approximate $1.9 billion benefit from remeasuring our deferred tax balances to the new statutory rate, partially offset by a charge of approximately $0.3 billion from accruing a Deemed Repatriation Tax. This net benefit had an impact of approximately 41.8 percentage points on the effective income tax rate. • A reduction in the Company's fiscal 2018 U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to 24.5% from 35.0% in the prior year. Net of state tax and other effects, the reduction in the statutory rate had an impact of approximately 9.2 percentage points on the effective income tax rate. Refer to Note 7 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the impacts of the Tax Act on the Company. Noncontrolling Interests Quarter Ended     (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   % Change Better/(Worse)  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 50     $ 9     >(100)   % The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was driven by lower tax expense at ESPN, largely due to the one-time benefit from the Tax Act. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes. SEASONALITY The Company's businesses are subject to the effects of seasonality. Consequently, the operating results for the quarter ended December 30, 2017 for each business segment, and for the Company as a whole, are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. Media Networks revenues are subject to seasonal advertising patterns, changes in viewership levels and timing of program sales. In general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Parks and Resorts revenues fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. Studio Entertainment revenues fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. Consumer Products & Interactive Media revenues are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in increased revenues during the Company's first and fourth fiscal quarter, and the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts. 25 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, which is shown below along with segment revenues: Quarter Ended   % Change (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Better/ (Worse) Revenues:           Media Networks $ 6,243     $ 6,233      -    % Parks and Resorts 5,154     4,555     13   % Studio Entertainment 2,504     2,520     (1)   % Consumer Products & Interactive Media 1,450     1,476     (2)   %   $ 15,351     $ 14,784     4   % Segment operating income:           Media Networks $ 1,193     $ 1,362     (12)   % Parks and Resorts 1,347     1,110     21   % Studio Entertainment 829     842     (2)   % Consumer Products & Interactive Media 617     642     (4)   %   $ 3,986     $ 3,956     1   % The following table reconciles segment operating income to income before income taxes: Quarter Ended   % Change (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Better/ (Worse) Segment operating income $ 3,986     $ 3,956     1   % Corporate and unallocated shared expenses (150 )   (132 )   (14)   % Restructuring and impairment charges (15 )    -      nm   Other income, net 53      -      nm   Interest expense, net (129 )   (99 )   (30)   % Income before income taxes $ 3,745     $ 3,725     1   % Depreciation expense is as follows: Quarter Ended   % Change (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Better/ (Worse) Media Networks           Cable Networks $ 39     $ 36     (8)   % Broadcasting 24     21     (14)   % Total Media Networks 63     57     (11)   % Parks and Resorts             Domestic 357     328     (9)   % International 177     156     (13)   % Total Parks and Resorts 534     484     (10)   % Studio Entertainment 13     12     (8)   % Consumer Products & Interactive Media 13     15     13   % Corporate 54     68     21   % Total depreciation expense $ 677     $ 636     (6)   % 26 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) Amortization of intangible assets is as follows: Quarter Ended   % Change (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Better/ (Worse) Media Networks $ 20     $ 2     >(100)   % Parks and Resorts  -      1      -    % Studio Entertainment 17     16     (6)   % Consumer Products & Interactive Media 28     32     13   % Total amortization of intangible assets $ 65     $ 51     (27)   % Media Networks Operating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: Quarter Ended   % Change (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Better/ (Worse) Revenues           Affiliate fees $ 3,205     $ 3,075     4   % Advertising 2,320     2,529     (8)   % TV/SVOD distribution and other 718     629     14   % Total revenues 6,243     6,233      -    % Operating expenses (4,370 )   (4,298 )   (2)   % Selling, general, administrative and other (647 )   (633 )   (2)   % Depreciation and amortization (83 )   (59 )   (41)   % Equity in the income of investees 50     119     (58)   % Operating Income $ 1,193     $ 1,362     (12)   % Revenues The increase in affiliate fees was due to growth of approximately 7% from higher contractual rates, partially offset by an approximately 3% decrease from fewer subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenues was due to a decrease of $124 million at Cable Networks, from $1,407 million to $1,283 million and a decrease of $85 million at Broadcasting, from $1,122 million to $1,037 million. The decrease at Cable Networks was due to decreases of 8% from lower average viewership and 1% from lower rates, both of which were negatively impacted by the shift of College Football Playoff (CFP) bowl games between the first and second fiscal quarters. The current quarter included three ""host"" bowl games, whereas the prior-year quarter included one host game and two semi-final games. Semi-final games generally generate more advertising revenue than host games. Broadcasting advertising revenues reflected decreases of 8% from lower network impressions and 5% from the owned television stations, partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher network rates. The decrease in network impressions was due to lower average viewership, partially offset by an increase in units delivered. The decrease at the owned television stations was due to lower political advertising. TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increased $89 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech and, to a lesser extent, higher sales of Freeform programs. On September 25, 2017, the Company increased its ownership in BAMTech and began consolidating their results. The Company's share of BAMTech's results was previously reported in equity in the income of investees. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $47 million, from $4,011 million to $4,058 million. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $36 million due to higher cost write-downs. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $11 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech, partially offset by lower sports programming costs at ESPN. Lower sports programming costs reflected the shift of CFP games as host games generally have lower costs than semi-final games. This decrease was partially offset by contractual rate increases for college sports and NFL programming. 27 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $14 million, from $633 million to $647 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech, partially offset by lower marketing costs at the Disney Channels and Freeform. Depreciation and amortization increased $24 million, from $59 million to $83 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech. Equity in the Income of Investees Income from equity investees decreased $69 million, from $119 million to $50 million due to higher losses from our investment in Hulu and lower operating results from A+E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses from BAMTech, which is now consolidated. The decrease at Hulu was due to higher programming and labor costs, partially offset by subscription and advertising revenue growth. The decrease at A+E was due to lower advertising revenue, higher marketing costs and increased programming costs. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income decreased $169 million, to $1,193 million due to lower income from equity investees, a decrease at the owned television stations, the consolidation of BAMTech, lower income from ABC program sales and decreases at ESPN and the ABC Network. These decreases were partially offset by increases at the Disney Channels and Freeform.

Domestic revenue growth benefited from the comparison to the impact of Hurricane Matthew, which occurred in the prior-year quarter. Revenue growth at our domestic operations was due to increases of 6% from higher average guest spending and 4% from higher volumes. Guest spending growth was primarily due to higher average ticket prices at our theme parks, increased food, beverage and merchandise spending and an increase in average daily hotel room rates. Higher volumes were due to attendance growth, an increase in passenger cruise ship days and higher vacation club unit sales, partially offset by lower occupied hotel room nights. Higher passenger cruise ship days reflected the impact of the Disney Wonder dry-dock in the prior-year quarter. The increase in vacation club unit sales was driven by sales at Copper Creek Villas & Cabins. At Walt Disney World Resort, available room nights decreased due to conversions to vacation club units. Revenue growth at our international operations was due to increases of 9% from higher volumes, 6% from higher average guest spending and 6% from a favorable foreign currency impact. The increase in volumes was due to higher attendance and occupied room nights at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Guest spending growth was driven by higher average ticket prices and increased food, beverage and merchandise spending at Disneyland Paris. The increases at Disneyland Paris reflected the benefit of the 25th Anniversary celebration.

Hotel statistics include rentals of Disney Vacation Club units. (2) Per capita guest spending growth rate is stated on a constant currency basis. Per room guest spending is stated at the fiscal 2017 first quarter average foreign exchange rate. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include operating labor, which increased $112 million, from $1,202 million to $1,314 million, infrastructure costs, which increased $50 million, from $462 million to $512 million, and cost of sales, which increased $40 million, from $419 million to $459 million. The increase in operating labor was driven by inflation, higher volumes and an unfavorable foreign currency impact. Higher infrastructure costs were primarily due to increased technology spending, higher maintenance expense and inflation. The increase in cost of sales was due to higher volumes and inflation. Other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions, and entertainment offerings, increased primarily due to new guest offerings, volume growth and inflation. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $44 million, from $411 million to $455 million primarily due to higher marketing spend and inflation. The increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts. Equity in the Loss of Investees Loss from equity investees increased $5 million to $7 million due to a higher operating loss from Villages Nature, in which Disneyland Paris has a 50% interest. 29 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) Segment Operating Income Segment operating income increased 21%, or $237 million, to $1,347 million due to growth at our domestic and international operations. Studio Entertainment Operating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: Quarter Ended   % Change (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Better/ (Worse) Revenues           Theatrical distribution $ 1,169     $ 961     22   % Home entertainment 390     547     (29)   % TV/SVOD distribution and other 945     1,012     (7)   % Total revenues 2,504     2,520     (1)   % Operating expenses (996 )   (1,007 )   1   % Selling, general, administrative and other (649 )   (643 )   (1)   % Depreciation and amortization (30 )   (28 )   (7)   % Operating Income $ 829     $ 842     (2)   % Revenues The increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the performance of Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Thor: Ragnarok in the current quarter compared to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Doctor Strange in the prior-year quarter. Other significant releases in the current quarter included Coco, while the prior-year quarter included Moana. Lower home entertainment revenue was due to decreases of 23% from lower unit sales and 3% from lower average net effective pricing, which reflected the performance of Cars 3 in the current quarter compared to Finding Dory in the prior-year quarter. Net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns. The decrease in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to decreases of 5% from TV/SVOD distribution and 1% from lower revenue share with the Consumer Products & Interactive Media segment. The decrease from TV/SVOD distribution was primarily due to a decrease at our pay television business driven by the domestic availability of two key titles in the prior-year quarter compared to one key title in the current quarter. The prior-year quarter included Captain America: Civil War and Jungle Book, while the current quarter included Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include an increase of $10 million in film cost amortization, from $666 million to $676 million as the impact of higher theatrical revenues was largely offset by the impact of lower home entertainment revenues. Operating expenses also include cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which decreased $21 million, from $341 million to $320 million due to lower home entertainment unit sales. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income decreased 2%, or $13 million, to $829 million as an increase in theatrical distribution results was more than offset by decreases in home entertainment and TV/SVOD distribution results and lower income from Consumer Products & Interactive Media segment revenue share. 30 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) Consumer Products & Interactive Media Operating results for the Consumer Products & Interactive Media segment are as follows: Quarter Ended   % Change (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Better/ (Worse) Revenues           Licensing, publishing and games $ 904     $ 936     (3)   % Retail and other 546     540     1   % Total revenues 1,450     1,476     (2)   % Operating expenses (560 )   (554 )   (1)   % Selling, general, administrative and other (232 )   (234 )   1   % Depreciation and amortization (41 )   (47 )   13   % Equity in the income of investees  -      1      -    % Operating Income $ 617     $ 642     (4)   % Revenues Lower licensing, publishing and games revenue was driven by a decrease of 3% from our merchandise licensing business, partially offset by a 1% increase from our games business. The decrease at merchandise licensing was due to unfavorable timing of minimum guarantee shortfall recognition and lower licensing revenues from merchandise based on Frozen and Finding Nemo/Dory, partially offset by increases from merchandise based on Cars and Star Wars. Star Wars licensing revenue included the recognition of revenue from merchandise based on Star Wars: The Last Jedi that was deferred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Higher revenue at our games business was due to licensing revenue from Star Wars Battlefront II, which was released in the current quarter, whereas there was no comparable release in the prior-year quarter. Minimum guarantee shortfalls are generally recognized at the end of the contract period. For contracts that ended on December 31, minimum guarantee shortfalls were recognized in the prior-year first quarter compared to the second quarter of the current year. Costs and Expenses Operating expenses include a $6 million increase in cost of goods sold and distribution costs, from $342 million to $348 million, a $9 million increase in other operating expenses, from $151 million to $160 million and a $9 million decrease in product development expense, from $61 million to $52 million. The increase in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact at our retail business. The increase in other operating expenses, which include occupancy costs, labor at our retail stores and other direct costs, was driven by an unfavorable foreign currency impact. The decrease in product development expense was driven by fewer games in development. Segment Operating Income Segment operating income decreased 4%, or $25 million, to $617 million, due to decreases at our merchandise licensing and retail businesses, partially offset by higher results at our games business. CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES Quarter Ended   % Change (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Better/ (Worse) Corporate and unallocated shared expenses $ (150 )   $ (132 )   (14)   % Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased $18 million to $150 million for the quarter due to costs incurred in connection with our agreement to acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. 31 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) IMPACT OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX REFORM As discussed in Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Tax Act resulted in the following impacts to the Company (the amounts recorded in the quarter are provisional and will be refined during fiscal 2018): • The Company's federal statutory income tax rate was reduced from 35.0% to 24.5% for fiscal 2018 and to 21.0% in following years. • The current quarter includes a one-time net benefit of approximately $1.6 billion, which reflected an approximate $1.9 billion benefit from remeasuring our deferred tax balances to the new statutory rate, partially offset by a charge of approximately $0.3 billion from accruing a Deemed Repatriation Tax. • Generally, there will no longer be a U.S. federal income tax cost on the repatriation of foreign earnings. • The Company will be eligible to claim an immediate deduction for investments in qualified fixed assets and film and television productions placed in service during fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. This provision phases out through fiscal 2027. • Certain provisions of the Act are not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019 including: • The elimination of the domestic production activities deduction. • The taxation of certain foreign derived income in the U.S. at an effective rate of approximately 13% (which increases to approximately 16% in 2025) rather than the general statutory rate of 21%. • A minimum effective tax on certain foreign earnings of approximately 13%. We are continuing to assess the impacts of these provisions, but do not currently anticipate that the net impact will be material to our fiscal 2019 effective income tax rate. • We expect a cash tax benefit similar to the reduction in the statutory rate, as well as a benefit from the immediate deduction for investments in qualified fixed assets and film and television productions. FINANCIAL CONDITION The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: Quarter Ended   % Change Better/ (Worse) (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016   Cash provided by operations $ 2,237     $ 1,445     55   % Cash used in investing activities (1,043 )   (1,035 )   (1)   % Cash used in financing activities (584 )   (987 )   41   % Impact of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 21     (112 )   nm   Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 631     $ (689 )   nm Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased 55% to $2.2 billion for the current quarter compared to $1.4 billion in the prior-year quarter due to a decrease in pension plan contributions and higher operating cash flow at Parks and Resorts partially offset by lower operating cash flow at Studio Entertainment and Media Networks. Parks and Resorts cash flow reflected higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenues, partially offset by higher labor and other costs. Lower operating cash flow at Studio Entertainment and Media Networks was due to higher film and television spending. Film and Television Costs The Company's Studio Entertainment and Media Networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce feature film and television programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Company's broadcast and cable networks and television stations. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability. 32 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) The Company's film and television production and programming activity for the quarter ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are as follows: Quarter Ended (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016 Beginning balances:       Production and programming assets $ 8,759     $ 7,547   Programming liabilities (1,108 )   (1,063 )   7,651     6,484   Spending:       Television program licenses and rights 2,114     2,031   Film and television production 1,687     1,275     3,801     3,306   Amortization:       Television program licenses and rights (2,728 )   (2,728 ) Film and television production (1,107 )   (1,018 )   (3,835 )   (3,746 )         Change in film and television production and programming costs (34 )   (440 ) Other non-cash activity (143 )   (36 ) Ending balances:       Production and programming assets 8,783     7,393   Programming liabilities (1,309 )   (1,385 )   $ 7,474     $ 6,008 Investing Activities Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Company's investments in parks, resorts and other property for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are as follows: Quarter Ended (in millions) December 30,  2017   December 31,  2016 Media Networks       Cable Networks $ 81     $ 46   Broadcasting 36     22   Total Media Networks 117     68   Parks and Resorts       Domestic 641     609   International 147     291   Total Parks and Resorts 788     900   Studio Entertainment 22     27   Consumer Products & Interactive Media 7     6   Corporate 47     39     $ 981     $ 1,040 Capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The decrease at our international parks and resorts was due to lower spending for Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The increase at our domestic parks and resorts was due to higher spending on new attractions. 33 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities. The increase at Cable Networks was due to technology spending at BAMTech. Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The Company currently expects its fiscal 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $1 billion higher than fiscal 2017 capital expenditures of $3.6 billion due to increased investments at our domestic parks and resorts. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $0.6 billion in the current quarter which reflected repurchases of common stock of $1.3 billion, partially offset by net cash inflows from borrowings of $0.8 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $0.6 billion was $0.4 billion lower than the $1.0 billion used in the prior-year quarter. The decrease from the prior-year quarter was due to higher borrowings in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter ($0.8 billion vs. $0.6 billion, respectively) and lower repurchases of common stock ($1.3 billion vs. $1.5 billion, respectively). See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company's borrowing activities during the quarter ended December 30, 2017 and information regarding the Company's bank facilities. The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company's dividends in fiscal 2018 and 2017 and share repurchases during the quarter ended December 30, 2017. We believe that the Company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company's borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of December 30, 2017, Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, with stable outlook and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F1, respectively, with stable outlook. On December 14, 2017, Standard & Poor's placed the Company's long-term and short-term debt ratings of A+ and A-1+, respectively, on Creditwatch with negative implications. The Company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on December 30, 2017 by a significant margin. The Company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the International Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.

For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Film and Television Revenues and Costs We expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film's release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company's estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products. With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company's ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, SVOD services and in home entertainment formats. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program's ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed. Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company's dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. Individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. Estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required. 35 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) Revenue Recognition We reduce home entertainment revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. These estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. If we underestimate the level of returns or sales incentives in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives exceed the estimated amount. Conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns or sales incentives for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives are less than estimated. We recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. Revenues from annual pass sales are recognized ratably over the period for which the pass is available for use. Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions The Company's pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Refer to the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. The Company's discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans' liability cash flows to the yield curves. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. We include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. These amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. We believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company's long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. The Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the 36 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group's long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group's long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. If we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges. The Company has cost and equity investments. The fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. In assessing the potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors, as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. If these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. Contingencies and Litigation We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies, and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure. Income Tax Audits As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company's decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company's success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments. 37 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  (continued) Policies and Procedures In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments. Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company's portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, British pound, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country. Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline. It is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes. 38","Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. See Item 2.

Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated balance sheet of Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") at September 30, 2017 was derived from the Company's audited consolidated financial statements at that date.  The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were prepared by the Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows were made.  The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year or of future operations. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America were omitted pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company's fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.  The Company continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product warranty reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and deferred income tax assets.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity at the time of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Short-term Investments The Company classifies its short-term investments consisting of corporate bonds, government bonds and other such similar investments as available-for-sale securities.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value with net unrealized holding gains and losses reported each period as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.  See note 2 for additional information. Inventories The Company records a write-down of its inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product, including any estimated future costs to complete the manufacturing process, exceeds its net realizable value.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.  Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method, except that certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries use an average cost method to value their inventories. The Company periodically reviews the composition of its inventories to determine if market demand, product modifications, technology changes, excessive quantities on-hand and other factors hinder its ability to recover its investment in such inventories.  The Company's assessment is based upon historical product demand, estimated future product demand and various other judgments and estimates.  Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of the Company's inventory investment will not be realized in its operating activities. The Company reviews its inventories for classification purposes.  The value of inventories not expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during its next operating cycle are classified as noncurrent assets. 7 GEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Impairment of Long-lived Assets The Company's long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.  The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets.  If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Revenue Recognition  -  Products and Services The Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of its manufactured products, including revenue derived from the sale of its manufactured rental equipment.  In addition, the Company generates revenue from the short-term rental under operating leases of its manufactured products.  The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, including the sale of used rental equipment, when all of the following have occurred: (i) title passes to the customer, (ii) the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, (iii) the product sales price has been determined, (iv) collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, and (v) product delivery occurs as directed by the customer.  Although infrequent, in cases where collectability is not reasonably assured, the installment or cost recovery method is used.  Except for certain of the Company's reservoir characterization products, the Company's products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions, and the Company's standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit.  The Company recognizes rental revenue as earned over the rental period.  Rentals of the Company's equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer.  Revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per hour basis.  Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate. Research and Development Costs The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred.  Research and development costs include salaries, employee benefit costs, department supplies, direct project costs and other related costs. Product Warranties Most of the Company's products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instructions.  The Company offers a standard product warranty obligating it to repair or replace equipment with manufacturing defects.  The Company maintains a reserve for future warranty costs based on historical experience or, in the absence of historical product experience, management's estimates.  Reserves for future warranty costs are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in the warranty reserve are reflected in the following table (in thousands): Balance at October 1, 2017  $  508     Accruals for warranties issued during the period     197     Settlements made (in cash or in kind) during the period     (150  )  Balance at December 31, 2017  $  555 8 GEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued guidance which eliminates the exception of recognizing, at the time of transfer, current and deferred income taxes for intercompany profits on intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory.  The Company adopted this guidance in its first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.  The adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings of $0.4 million.  Under prior guidance, the Company maintained a non-current prepaid income tax asset on its consolidated balance sheets representing income taxes paid in the U.S. on profits realized from the sale of rental equipment to its foreign subsidiaries.  As this rental equipment was depreciated, the prepaid tax was recognized as a current income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.  Under the new guidance, the Company is required to recognize a deferred tax asset related to the intercompany profits realized on the sale of non-inventory assets to its subsidiaries; however, profits realized from the intercompany sale of inventories will continue to be accounted for as a prepaid income tax asset in accordance with the prior guidance.  Under the new guidance, the deferred tax asset resulting from the sale of non-inventory assets is recognized at the jurisdictional tax rate of the subsidiary which purchased the asset.  Any differences between the subsidiary's jurisdictional tax rate and the seller's tax rate pertaining to the intercompany profit are charged to seller's current income tax expense at the time of the sale.  With the recent reduction in the U.S. income tax rate to 21%, and assuming that a majority of the Company's equipment sales will continue to be made to its Canadian subsidiary having a higher statutory tax rate, the new guidance is expected to have a favorable impact on the Company's provision for income taxes in future periods.  Due to the fact the Company has a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, the adoption of this guidance had no impact upon the Company's income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify key components of employee share-based payment accounting.  The new guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification of excess tax benefits from share-based payments on the statement of cash flows.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.  No cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was needed upon adoption as the Company has no unrecorded excess tax benefits residing in additional paid-in-capital account.  Under the prior standard, the Company was required to track and record as a component of additional paid-in capital the tax impact of cumulative windfalls, net of any shortfalls, which resulted from excess tax benefits from share-based payments. As a result, the impact of net windfalls has not historically affected the Company's provision for income taxes or its effective income tax rate.  Under the new guidance, the Company will no longer track windfalls or shortfalls resulting from share-based payments since all future windfalls and shortfalls will be recorded as a component of the Company's current provision for income taxes.  Depending on the magnitude of future windfalls or shortfalls, this change could significantly affect the Company's provision for income taxes in a positive or negative direction.  Due to the fact the Company has a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, the adoption of this guidance had no impact upon the Company's income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017. In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Under the new guidance, net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.    Since the Company is a manufacturer and the nature of its inventory is generally unique to its designs and applications thus preventing the gathering of relevant external market data, its existing practice for calculating net realizable value under the current standard is consistent with the practice prescribed by the new guidance.  The Company adopted this standard in its first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. The adoption did not have a material effect upon the Company's consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.  Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  This guidance must be adopted by the Company no later than its first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and should be applied on a retrospective transition basis.  The Company has historically not held restricted cash balances and, therefore, does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.  However, upon adoption of this guidance, the Company will make any necessary changes to present restricted cash balances in accordance with the guidance. 9 GEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance surrounding credit losses for financial instruments that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"").  The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other financial instruments.  For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, credit losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.  The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 is permitted.  Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period.  The Company expects to adopt this standard during the first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2021 and is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expense and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification of the lease as a finance or operating lease.  However, unlike current GAAP, which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new guidance will also require operating leases of the lessee to be recognized on the balance sheet if the operating lease term is more than 12 months.  The guidance also requires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach.  The Company expects to adopt this standard in its first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2020.  The Company currently is not a lessee under any lease agreements with a term longer than one year.  The Company is routinely a lessor in its rental contracts with customers; however, these rental agreements are generally short-term in nature, and the Company believes would be treated as operating leases under the new guidance; however, the Company has not completed a detailed review of its lease arrangements, and these conclusions are subject to change. In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to recognize revenue from contracts with customers by applying a five-step model in accordance with the core principle to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In addition, this guidance specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements for revenue recognition.  In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of this guidance to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein.  Entities have the option to adopt this guidance either retrospectively or through a modified retrospective transition method.  This new standard will supersede existing revenue guidance and affect the Company's revenue recognition process and the presentations or disclosures of the Company's consolidated financial statements and footnotes.  The Company recognizes revenue through three primary transactions types:  (i) the immediate recognition of revenue through the routine delivery of products to its customers, (ii) the rental of equipment to its customers through short-term operating leases, and (iii) the recognition of revenue utilizing the percentage of completion method for the delivery of complex products requiring long manufacturing times and substantial engineering resources.  The Company expects to adopt this standard in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and is in the early stages of evaluating the standard, including the method of adoption to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Further disclosures around policy changes or quantitative effects will be made as the Company moves closer to the adoption of this standard. 2.

Derivative Financial Instruments At December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, the Company's Canadian subsidiary had CAN$32.7 million and CAD$26.1 million, respectively, of Canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable owed to one of the Company's U.S subsidiaries.  In order to mitigate its exposure to movements in foreign currency rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, the Company routinely enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar.  On December 29, 2017, the Company entered into a CAN$32.0 million 90-day hedge contract effective January 2, 2018 with a United States bank to reduce the impact on cash flows from movements in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar currency exchange rate, but has not been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes.  The Company's derivative instruments had no fair value as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017. The following table summarizes the Company's gains on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): Three Months Ended     Derivative Instrument     Location     December 31, 2017        December 31, 2016     Foreign Currency Forward Contracts     Other Income (Expense)     $  158        $  72 Amounts in the above table include realized and unrealized derivative gains and losses. 4.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments At December 31, 2017, the Company's financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, derivative instruments, trade accounts and financing receivables and accounts payable.  Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value on the respective balance sheet dates. The Company measures its short-term investments and derivative instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.

Raw materials include semi-finished goods and component parts which totaled approximately $44.1 million and $43.2 million at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively. 7.   Long-Term Debt The Company had no long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017. On March 2, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Frost Bank with borrowing availability of $50.0 million (the ""Credit Agreement"").  On May 4, 2015, the Company amended the Credit Agreement which reduced its borrowing availability to $30.0 million with amounts available for borrowing determined by a borrowing base.  On October 25, 2017, the Company entered into another amendment to the Credit Agreement which extended its maturity to April 30, 2019.  The 2017 amendment also modified the borrowing base to be determined based upon certain of the Company's assets which include (i) 80% of certain accounts receivable plus (ii) 50% of certain notes receivable (such result not to exceed $10 million) plus (iii) 25% of certain inventories (such result not to exceed $20 million) and requires the Company to maintain unencumbered liquid assets of $10 million.  The 2017 amendment also removed a requirement that the Company maintain a financial ratio that compares certain of the Company's assets to certain of its liabilities and imposed a new financial covenant that the Company maintain a minimum amount of certain liquid assets.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company's borrowing base was $26.6 million.  As of December 31, 2017, the amount available for borrowing was $26.3 million after consideration of $0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit.  The Company's domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured their obligations under such guarantees by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries, except real property assets.  The Company is required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds.  The Credit Agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, restricts the Company and its subsidiaries' ability to pay cash dividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type.  The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Agreement is based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which was 4.50% at December 31, 2017.  At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 13 GEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 8.   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following (in thousands): Unrealized Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities        Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments        Totals     Balance at October 1, 2017     $  (58  )     $  (14,172  )     $  (14,230  )  Changes in unrealized losses on available-for-sale    securities        (51  )         -            (51  )  Foreign currency translation adjustments         -            (205  )        (205  )  Balance at December 31, 2017     $  (109  )     $  (14,377  )     $  (14,486  ) 9.   Stock-Based Compensation During the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company issued 138,650 shares of restricted stock under its 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended.  The weighted average grant date fair value of the restricted stock was $15.54 per share.  The grant date fair value of these awards was $2.2 million, which will be charged to expense over the next four years as the restrictions lapse.  Compensation expense for restricted stock awards was determined based on the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that are anticipated to fully vest.  Recipients of restricted stock awards are entitled to vote such shares and are entitled to dividends, if paid. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had unrecognized compensation expense of $4.8 million relating to restricted stock awards.  This unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.1 years.  In addition, the Company had $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonqualified stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.2 years. As of December 31, 2017, a total of 300,675 shares of restricted stock and 201,800 nonqualified stock options shares were outstanding. 10.   Loss Per Common Share The Company applies the two -class method in calculating per share data.  The following table summarizes the calculation of net loss and weighted average common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding for purposes of the computation of loss per share (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended           December 31, 2017        December 31, 2016     Net loss     $  (9,480  )     $  (11,705  )  Less: Income allocable to unvested restricted stock         -             -      Loss available to common shareholders        (9,480  )        (11,705  )  Reallocation of participating earnings         -             -      Loss attributable to common shareholders for diluted    earnings per share     $  (9,480  )     $  (11,705  )  Weighted average number of common share equivalents:                          Common shares used in basic loss per share        13,202,384           13,094,809     Common share equivalents outstanding related to    stock options         -             -      Total weighted average common shares and common    share equivalents used in diluted loss per share        13,202,384           13,094,809     Loss per share:                          Basic     $  (0.72  )     $  (0.89  )  Diluted     $  (0.72  )     $  (0.89  ) 14 GEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) For the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, 201,800 and 206,300 stock options, respectively, were excluded in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as a result of their impact being antidilutive. 11.   Commitments and Contingencies The Company is involved in various pending or potential legal actions in the ordinary course of its business.  Management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation.  Management is not aware of any material pending or known to be contemplated legal or government proceedings against the Company. 12.   Segment Information The Company reports and evaluates financial information for two segments:  Seismic and Non-Seismic. Seismic product lines include: land and marine wireless data acquisition systems, permanent land and seabed reservoir monitoring products and services, geophones and geophone strings, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, telemetry cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other products.  The Non-Seismic product lines include imaging products and industrial products. The following table summarizes the Company's segment information (in thousands): Three Months Ended           December 31, 2017        December 31, 2016     Revenue:                          Seismic     $  8,039        $  9,406     Non-Seismic        6,454           5,736     Corporate        151           143     Total     $  14,644        $  15,285                                Income (loss) from operations:                          Seismic     $  (7,673  )     $  (9,453  )  Non-Seismic        1,029           1,052     Corporate        (2,961  )        (2,910  )  Total     $  (9,605  )     $  (11,311  ) 13.   Income Taxes The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the Act""), which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.  Income tax effects resulting from changes in tax laws are accounted for by the Company in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that these tax effects be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted and the effects are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. As a result, the Company made changes to its provision for income tax resulting from the enactment of the Act for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system which reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% as of January 1, 2018; shifts to a modified territorial tax regime which requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred; and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.  The decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% results in a blended statutory tax rate of 24.5% for the Company's fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. The new taxes for certain foreign-sourced earnings under the Act are effective for the Company after the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. The Company is currently in the early stages of evaluating the impact of the Act on its consolidated financial statements.  Based on the Company's initial assessments to date, it expects the one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and profits to have a minimal cash impact since it anticipates that it will be able to utilize existing net operating loss carryforwards to substantially offset any taxes payable on foreign earnings and profits.  Additionally, the Company has adjusted its U.S. gross deferred tax assets and 15 GEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) liabilities to the new 21% statutory tax rate; however, it also recorded a corresponding adjustment to a valuation allowance which resulted in no net impact to deferred tax assets or provision for income taxes.  Except for the adjustments referred to above,  the Company has not recorded any income tax effects of the Act in its consolidated financial statements (including any provisional amounts) because it does not yet have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the applicable accounting. The Company's effective tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were (0.1)% and (9.6)% , respectively.  The United States statutory rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 24.5% (blended) and 35%, respectively.  Compared to the United States statutory rate, the lower effective tax rates resulted primarily from the provision of a valuation allowance against the Company's U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company's ability to utilize such deferred tax assets in the future to offset taxable income. 14.   Exit and Disposal Activities In December 2017, the Company initiated a program to reduce operating costs in light of expected and continuing low levels of seismic product demand.  The program is expected to produce approximately $6 million of annualized cash savings.  The majority of the cost reductions were realized through a reduction of over 60 employees from the Company's Houston area workforce.   In connection with the workforce reductions, the Company incurred $0.7 million of termination costs in its first quarter of fiscal year 2018.  The termination costs were recorded to both cost of revenue and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.  No further termination costs are expected and there are no outstanding liabilities related to this program as of December 31, 2017. 16","","Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is management's discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated financial statements.  You should read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes, and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated by reference herein, if any, contain ""forward-looking"" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"").  These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as ""may"", ""will"", ""should"", ""intend"", ""expect"", ""plan"", ""budget"", ""forecast"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""estimate"", ""predict"", ""potential"", ""continue"", ""evaluating"" or similar words.  Statements that contain these words should be read carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward-looking information.  Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements that we make regarding our expected operating results, the adoption and sale of our products in various geographic regions, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and the sources of funding therefore, and our strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and the provision of accounting reserves.  These forward-looking statements reflect our best judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us.  However, there will likely be events in the future that we are not able to predict or control.  The factors listed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, as well as other cautionary language in such Annual Report and this Quarterly Report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements.  Such examples include, but are not limited to, decreases in commodity price levels, which could reduce demand for our products, the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance, despite substantial investment by us, our sensitivity to short term backlog, delayed or cancelled customer orders, product obsolescence resulting from poor industry conditions or new technologies, bad debt write-offs associated with customer accounts, and any negative impact from our restatement of our financial statements regarding current assets.  The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position, and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations.  We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Business Overview Geospace Technologies Corporation reincorporated as a Texas corporation on April 16, 2015.  We originally incorporated as a Delaware corporation on September 27, 1994.  Unless otherwise specified, the discussion in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers to Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries.  We design and manufacture instruments and equipment used in the oil and gas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs.  We also design and manufacture non-seismic products, including industrial products, offshore cables and imaging equipment.  We report and categorize our customers and products into two different segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic. We have engaged in the seismic instrument and equipment business since 1980 and market our products primarily to the oil and gas industry.  Demand for our products has been, and will likely continue to be, vulnerable to downturns in the economy and the oil and gas industry in general.  For more information, please refer to the risks discussed under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.

Geoscientists use seismic data primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and known hydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them.  Our seismic product lines currently consist of land and marine nodal data acquisition systems, permanent land and seabed reservoir monitoring products and services, geophones and geophone strings, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, telemetry cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other products.  Our seismic products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition systems currently in use.  We believe that our seismic products are among the most technologically advanced instruments and equipment available for seismic data acquisition. Traditional Products An energy source and a data recording system are combined to acquire seismic data.  We provide many of the components of seismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings, connectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products.  On land, our customers use geophones, leader wire, cables and connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the seismic information for subsequent processing and analysis.  In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic cables known as ""streamers"" containing hydrophones which are used to detect pressure changes.  Hydrophones transmit electrical impulses back to the vessel's data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for subsequent processing and analysis.  Our marine seismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help recover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel. Our seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition systems currently in use.  Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as components of new seismic data acquisition systems or to repair and replace components of seismic data acquisition systems already in use. Our products used in marine seismic data acquisition include our seismic streamer retrieval devices (""SRDs"").  Occasionally, streamer cables are severed and become disconnected from the vessel as a result of obstacles, inclement weather, vessel traffic or human error.  Our SRDs, which are attached to the streamer cables, contain air bags which are designed to inflate automatically at a given water depth, bringing the severed streamer cables to the surface.  These SRDs save the seismic contractors significant time and money compared to the alternative of losing the streamer cable.  We also produce seismic streamer steering devices, or ""birds,"" which are fin-like devices that attach to the streamer cable.  These birds help maintain the streamer cable at a certain desired depth as it is being towed through the water. Wireless Products We have developed a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system called the GSX.  Rather than utilizing interconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each GSX station operates as an independent data collection system, allowing our GSX stations to be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations.  As a result, our GSX system requires less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its reduced environmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation.  Our GSX system is designed into configurations ranging from one to four channels per station.  Since its introduction in 2008 and through December 31, 2017, we have sold 417,000 GSX channels and we have 64,000 GSX channels in our rental fleet.  We expect to make additional investments in our GSX rental fleet in fiscal year 2018 to replenish a sale of used GSX rental equipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. We have also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX.  Similar to our GSX land-based wireless system, the marine OBX system can be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not require interconnecting cables between each station.  Our deep water versions of the OBX system can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450 meters.  Through December 31, 2017, we have sold approximately 600 OBX stations and we have 6,700 OBX stations in our rental fleet. Reservoir Products Seismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within the reservoir and can be used to monitor the effects of oil and gas development and production.  In this regard, we have developed permanently installed high-definition reservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom applications in producing oil and gas fields.  We also produce a retrievable version of our ocean-bottom system for use on fields where permanently installed systems are not appropriate or economical.  Utilizing these tools, producers can enhance the recovery of oil and gas deposits over the life of a reservoir. 18 Our high-definition reservoir monitoring products include the HDSeis™ product line and a suite of borehole and reservoir monitoring products and services.  Our HDSeis™ system is a high-definition seismic data acquisition system with flexible architecture that allows it to be configured as a borehole seismic system or as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring projects.  The scalable architecture of the HDSeis™ system enables custom designed system configuration for applications ranging from low-channel engineering and environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels to high-channel surveys required to efficiently conduct permanent reservoir monitoring (""PRM"").  Modular architecture allows virtually unlimited channel expansion.  In addition, multi-system synchronization features make the HDSeis™ system well suited for multi-well or multi-site acquisition, simultaneous surface and downhole acquisition and continuous reservoir monitoring projects. Reservoir monitoring requires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and functional reliability assumes greater importance.  This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations over a considerable period of time.  Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special instrumentation and new techniques to maximize recovery.  Reservoir monitoring also requires high-bandwidth, high-resolution seismic data for engineering project planning and reservoir management.  We believe our HDSeis™ System and tools, designed for cost-effective deployment and lifetime performance, will make borehole and seabed seismic acquisition a cost-effective and reliable process for the challenges of reservoir monitoring.  Our multi-component seismic product developments include an omni-directional geophone for use in reservoir monitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose connectors, connector arrays and cases. We have not delivered nor did we receive orders for any permanent reservoir monitoring systems during fiscal year 2017 or during the first three months of fiscal year 2018. In addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems which employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of very high data transmission rates.  These systems are used for several reservoir monitoring applications, including an application pioneered by us allowing operators and service companies to monitor and measure the results of fracturing operations. Non-Seismic Products Our non-seismic businesses leverage upon our existing manufacturing facilities and engineering capabilities.  We have found that many of our seismic products, with little or no modification, have direct application to industries beyond those involved in oil and gas exploration and development.  For example, our customers utilize our borehole tools to monitor subsurface carbon dioxide injections and for mine safety applications. Our non-seismic products include electronic pre-press products that employ direct thermal imaging and digital inkjet printing technologies targeted at the commercial graphics, industrial graphics, textile and flexographic printing industries.  Our other non-seismic products consist of (i) sensors and tools for vibration monitoring, mine safety application and earthquake detection, (ii) cables for power and communication for the offshore oil and gas and offshore construction industries, (iii) water meter cables and connectors, and (iv) other specialty industrial cable and connector products. 19 Consolidated Results of Operations We report and evaluate financial information for two segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic.  Summary financial data by business segment follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended           December 31, 2017        December 31, 2016     Seismic                          Traditional exploration product revenue     $  3,790        $  2,570     Wireless exploration product revenue        3,631           6,323     Reservoir product revenue        618           513     Total revenue        8,039           9,406     Operating loss        (7,673  )        (9,453  )  Non-Seismic                          Industrial product revenue        3,676           3,079     Imaging product revenue        2,778           2,657     Total revenue        6,454           5,736     Operating income        1,029           1,052     Corporate                          Revenue        151           143     Operating loss        (2,961  )        (2,910  )  Consolidated Totals                          Revenue        14,644           15,285     Operating loss        (9,605  )        (11,311  ) Overview Early in calendar year 2014, we began to experience a softening in the demand for our seismic exploration products, particularly in North America, as capital budgets for oil and gas producers were trending away from exploration-focused activities toward production and exploitation activities.  During this period oil production in North America's unconventional shale reservoirs increased, as did oil production from other non-OPEC countries, resulting in an oversupply of crude oil in the world market.  Market prices for a barrel of crude oil declined from over $100 in July 2014 to approximately $27 in January 2016, and have recovered somewhat to approximately $64 today.  With this decline in oil and natural gas prices, oil and gas exploration and production companies experienced a significant reduction in cash flows, which resulted in sharp reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration-focused activities, including seismic activities.  We expect revenue from our seismic products, and in particular our traditional and wireless products, to remain low until crude oil prices stabilize at higher levels and exploration-focused industry conditions improve.  We expect these challenging industry conditions to continue to negatively impact the demand for our seismic products throughout fiscal year 2018. In September 2017, we were notified by a previous PRM system customer that it was in the process of requesting quotes for two new PRM systems which must utilize fiber optic sensor technology.  Since our PRM designs utilize electrical sensor technology, we did not participate with a quotation for the design and manufacture of these PRM systems.  We believe that our PRM system designs, which utilize electrical sensor technology, provide the best long-term functionality and performance of any PRM system, and we continue to aggressively market our PRM systems to major oil and gas companies.  However, the occurrence of this notice, combined with the absence of any new PRM orders of any technology type since November 2012, have caused us to provide additional obsolescence reserves for a substantial portion of our PRM inventories, and we concluded a triggering event occurred and performed an impairment assessment on certain heavy equipment used for the manufacturing of PRM systems, which resulted in an impairment.  Specific to our PRM inventories and manufacturing equipment, we recorded obsolescence reserves of $5.1 million and impairment expense of $5.3 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. In December 2017, we initiated a program to reduce operating costs in light of expected and continuing low levels of seismic product demand.  The program is expected to produce approximately $6 million of annualized cash savings.  The majority of the cost reductions were realized through a reduction of over 60 employees from our Houston area workforce.  In connection with the workforce reductions, we incurred $0.7 million of termination costs in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018.  The termination costs were recorded to both cost of revenue and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.  No further termination costs are expected and there are no outstanding liabilities related to this program as of December 31, 2017. 20 Three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 Consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017, decreased $0.6 million, or 4.2%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The decrease in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in wireless exploration rental revenue in our seismic business segment. Consolidated gross profit (loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was a loss of ($1.0) million, compared to a loss of ($3.3) million for the corresponding period of prior fiscal year.  The improvement in gross profit (loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of a decrease in inventory obsolescence and rental equipment depreciation expenses.  These improvements were partially offset by a decrease in wireless exploration rental revenue.  Until seismic product demand increases to historical norms, we expect our consolidated gross margins to remain low. In light of current market conditions, our seismic product inventories at December 31, 2017 far exceed levels considered appropriate for the current level of product demand.  While we are aggressively working to reduce these legacy inventory balances, we have also added new inventories for recent product developments and other product demand.  During periods of excessive inventory levels, our policy has been, and will continue to be, to record obsolescence expense in our consolidated income statement as we experience reduced levels of inventory turnover and as our inventories continue to age.  If current market conditions continue, we expect to record additional inventory obsolescence expense in fiscal year 2018 and beyond until seismic product demand and resulting seismic inventory turnover returns to acceptable levels. Consolidated operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $8.6 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 8.2%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  This increase was primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in bad debt expense.  Excluding the change in bad debt, consolidated operating expense declined by $0.1 million due to a reduction is stock-based compensation expenses and partially offset by termination costs. Consolidated other income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $131,000, an increase of $91,000 from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The increase for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from increased financing receivables. Consolidated income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6,000 compared to $0.4 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  Our effective tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were (0.1)% and (9.6)%, respectively.  The United States statutory tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 24.5% (blended) and 35%, respectively.  Compared to the United States statutory rate, the lower effective tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 primarily resulted from our inability to recognize any tax benefits for the tax losses we incurred in the U.S. and Canada due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize these losses in the future to offset taxable income. Seismic Products Revenue Revenue from our seismic products for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $1.4 million, or 14.5%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The components of this decrease include the following: •  Traditional Exploration Product Revenue  -  For the three months ended December 31, 2017, revenue from our traditional products increased $1.2 million, or 47.5% from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The increase was due to an increase in certain specialty sensor product sales and the sale of sensors from our rental fleet. •  Wireless Exploration Product Revenue  -  For the three months ended December 31, 2017, revenue from our wireless exploration products decreased by $2.7 million, or 42.6%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The decrease was primarily due to a large OBX rental contract that was active during the three months ended December 31, 2016.  This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our GSX wireless products from our rental fleet. •  Reservoir Product Revenue  -  For the three months ended December 31, 2017, revenue from our reservoir products increased $0.1 million, or 20.5%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The increase was primarily due to higher demand for our borehole and other products, and increased service revenues. Operating Loss Despite decreased revenues, our operating loss associated with our seismic products for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $1.8 million, or 18.9%, from the corresponding period of the prior year.  The decrease in operating loss was 21 primarily due to a decrease in inventory obsolescence and rental equipment depreciation expenses.  These decreases were partially offset by lower wireless exploration rental revenue. Non-Seismic Products Revenue Revenue from our non-seismic products for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.7 million, or 12.5%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The components of this increase included the following: •  Industrial Product Revenue  -  For the three months ended December 31, 2017, revenue from our industrial products increased $0.6 million, or 19.4% from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher demand for our water meter products. •  Imaging Product Revenue  -  For the three months ended December 31, 2017, revenue from our imaging products increased $0.1 million, or 4.6%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The increase was primarily due to higher demand for our equipment and film products. Operating Income Our operating income associated with sales of our non-seismic products for the three months ended December 31, 2017 declined $23,000 from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  The decline resulted from reduced gross profit margins due to higher manufacturing costs, and increased operating expenses resulting from increased sales and marketing expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $13.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $32.1 million in short-term investments.  For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we used $5.8 million of cash in operating activities.  Our net loss of $9.1 million was offset by (i) net non-cash charges of $5.9 million from deferred income taxes, depreciation, accretion, inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation and bad debts, (ii) a $2.6 million decrease in trade accounts receivable resulting from the timing of collections from customers, and (iii) a $0.7 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to an increase in inventories and the timing of payments to suppliers.  Other uses of cash in our operations included (i) a $2.9 increase in inventories for the replenishment of rental equipment sold to customers and the purchase of raw materials for new product production and (ii) the removal of a $2.6 million gross profit from the sale of used rental equipment since such gross profit is reflected in the proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment under investing activities. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we generated cash of $4.8 million from investing activities.  Sources of cash included (i) $4.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments and (ii) $1.0 million of proceeds from the sale of rental equipment.  These sources of cash were partially offset by an investment of $0.2 million in property, plant and equipment.   We estimate total fiscal year 2018 cash investments in property, plant and equipment will be approximately $3 million.  We expect fiscal year 2018 cash investments into our rental fleet to be approximately $2 million in order to replenish land-based wireless rental fleet equipment recently sold to customers.  Our capital expenditures are expected to be funded from our cash on hand, internal cash flow or, if necessary, from borrowings under our credit agreement. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had no cash flows from financing activities.  We had no long-term debt outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 or for the three months ended December 31, 2017. While crude oil prices have recently increased to their highest level in three years, the current level of crude oil prices remain significantly below the peak price levels seen in 2014.  These lower crude oil prices combined with an ample supply of crude oil in the world market do not support the investment required by many exploration and production companies to explore and develop new frontier areas for oil and gas development and production.  In addition, many smaller exploration and production companies are under-capitalized and their capital spending budgets for exploration-focused activities, including seismic activities, are financial restrained.  As a result, our seismic business segment continues to experience lower levels of product orders and associated revenue, resulting in substantial operating losses and the continued depletion of our cash balances.  Due to the uncertainty concerning a recovery of crude oil prices to levels capable of sustaining increased seismic exploration activities, we expect these depressed seismic market conditions to continue through fiscal year 2018. Our available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $46.0 million at December 31, 2017, including $8.4 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices.  In light of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 which requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on undistributed earnings of foreign 22 subsidiaries, we are currently re-evaluating our prior intent to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings.  If we were to repatriate the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries, we would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amounts repatriated. Our credit agreement allows for borrowings of up to $30.0 million with such amounts available for borrowing determined by a borrowing base.  In October 2017, we extended the maturity of the credit agreement from May 2018 to April 2019.  At December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and, after consideration of $0.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, our borrowing availability under the credit facility was $26.3 million.  At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement.  We currently do not anticipate the need to borrow under the credit agreement; however, we can make no assurance that we will not do so. In fiscal years 2016 and 2017, we received income tax refunds of $18.3 million and $12.8 million, respectively, from the U.S. Department of Treasury.  These refunds were a result of the significant tax losses we experienced in fiscal year 2016 and 2015, which we elected to carryback and recoup taxes previously paid.  For U.S. income tax purposes, we are now in a loss carryforward position in regards to our tax losses for fiscal year 2017 and beyond.  As a result, we will not receive any additional U.S. federal income tax refunds as a result of our current tax losses.  The tax refunds we received in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 have been significant contributors to our overall liquidity.  In the absence of future profitable results of operations, we may need to rely on other sources of liquidity to fund our future operating results, including liquidating short-term investments, executed rental contracts, available borrowings under our credit agreement through its expiration in April 2019, leveraging or sale of real estate assets, sales of rental assets and other liquidity sources which may be available to us.  However, currently we believe that our cash and short-term investment balances will be sufficient to finance our operating losses and planned capital expenditures through December 2018. Critical Accounting Policies During the three months ended December 31, 2017, there has been no material change to our critical accounting policies discussed in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 other than the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting"" and 2016-16, ""Accounting for Income Taxes:  Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory"". Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.","Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We have market risk relative to our short-term investments, foreign currency rates and interest rates.  We do not engage in commodity or commodity derivative instrument purchase or sales transactions.  Because of the inherent unpredictability of foreign currency rates and interest rates, as well as other factors, actual results could differ materially from those projected in this Item. Foreign Currency and Operations Risk One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Geospace Technologies Eurasia, is located in the Russian Federation.  In addition, we operate a branch office, Geospace Technologies Sucursal Sudamericana, in Colombia.  Our financial results for these entities may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, weak economic conditions or changes in the political climate.  Our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 reflected approximately USD $6.0 million and USD $0.2 million of foreign currency denominated net working capital related to our Russian and Colombian operations, respectively.  Both of these entities receive a portion of their revenue and pay a majority of their expenses primarily in their local currency.  To the extent that transactions of these entities are settled in their local currency, a devaluation of these currencies versus the U.S. dollar could reduce any contribution from these entities to our consolidated results of operations and total comprehensive income as reported in U.S. dollars.  We do not hedge the market risk with respect to our operations in these countries; therefore, such risk is a general and unpredictable risk of future disruptions in the valuation of such currencies versus U.S. dollars to the extent such disruptions result in any reduced valuation of these foreign entities' net working capital or future contributions to our consolidated results of operations.  At December 31, 2017, the foreign exchange rate for $1.00 (one U.S. dollar) was equal to approximately 57.61 Russian Rubles and 2,973 Colombian Pesos, respectively.  If the value of the U.S. dollar were to strengthen by ten percent against these foreign currencies, our working capital in the Russian Federation and in Colombia would decline by USD $0.6 million and USD $20,000, respectively. 23 Foreign Currency Intercompany Accounts and Notes Receivable From time to time, we may provide access to capital to our foreign subsidiaries through U.S. dollar denominated interest bearing promissory notes.  Such funds are generally used by our foreign subsidiaries to purchase capital assets and for general working capital needs.  In addition, we sell products to our foreign subsidiaries on trade credit terms in both U.S. dollars and in the subsidiary's local currency.  At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding Canadian-dollar denominated intercompany accounts receivable of CAN $33.6 million, which we consider to be of a short-term nature.  The appreciation or devaluation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar will result in a gain or loss, respectively, to our consolidated statement of operations.  At December 31, 2017, the foreign exchange rate for USD $1.00 was equal to approximately CAN $1.26.  On December 29, 2017 we entered into a CAN $32.0 million 90-day hedge agreement effective January 2, 2018 with a United States bank to hedge a portion of our Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate exposure, resulting in an under-hedged position of approximately CAN $1.6 million.  At December 31, 2017, if the U.S. dollar exchange rate were to strengthen by ten percent against the Canadian dollar, we would recognize a foreign exchange loss of USD $0.1 million in our consolidated financial statements. Floating Interest Rate Risk Our credit agreement contains a floating interest rate which subjects us to the risk of increased interest costs associated with any upward movements in bank market interest rates.  Under our credit agreement our borrowing interest rate is the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which was 4.50% at December 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement.","","Item 4.   Controls and Procedures Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") and Chief Financial Officer (""CFO"").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within our company and consolidated subsidiaries to report material information otherwise required to be set forth in our reports. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, as of December 31, 2017, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.  Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We previously reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.  As of September 30, 2017, we did not maintain effective controls concerning our classification of current assets with respect to inventories.  We determined that a portion of our inventories should have been classified as noncurrent assets, as all inventories were not reasonably expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during our next operating cycle. This error was subsequently identified and corrected, and resulted in a restatement to the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and as of December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, which was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.  The error had no impact upon previously reported total assets, total liabilities, revenues, net loss, net loss per share, or cash flows. To remediate the material weakness described above we have designed and implemented a quarterly control to determine the value of inventories expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during the next operating cycle.  This control, which encompasses a review by senior management, utilizes a combination of forecasts and historical trends to determine our future expected inventory utilization.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1  -  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Company"").  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""U.S. GAAP"") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year.  The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and income taxes.  Descriptions of these policies are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.  See Income Taxes for additional discussion regarding tax legislation enacted by the U.S. government in December 2017, the impact of which may affect the estimates and assumptions used to determine the expected future tax consequences of events recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements.  Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate.  As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.  Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. Currency Translation and Transactions All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at period-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange for the period.  Unrealized translation gains (losses), net of tax, reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) (""OCI"") attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. were $30 million and $(120) million, net of tax, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $84 million and $(120) million, net of tax, during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures.  Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading. The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions of $(17) million and $1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $(35) million and $6 million during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions totaling $38 million and $30 million as of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. 6 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Concentration of Credit Risk The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.  The Company's sales subject to credit risk are made primarily to department stores, perfumeries, specialty multi-brand retailers and retailers in its travel retail business.  The Company grants credit to qualified customers and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.  The Company does not have any customers that represent 10% or greater of its consolidated net sales or accounts receivable in each period presented.

Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's measurement of inventory and promotional merchandise.

Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment was $114 million and $108 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $226 million and $210 million during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Depreciation and amortization related to the Company's manufacturing process is included in Cost of Sales, and all other depreciation and amortization is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. 7 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the TCJA""). The TCJA includes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that impacted the Company's accounting and reporting for income taxes in the current-year period.  These impacts primarily consist of the following: ·                  A reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which will result in a fiscal 2018 U.S. blended statutory income tax rate for the Company of 28%. ·                  A one-time transitional repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings (""Transition Tax""), which may be paid over an eight-year period. ·                  The remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets as of the enactment date. On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (""SAB 118"") to provide guidance that companies should apply each reporting period related to the income tax effects of the TCJA. SAB 118 provides that companies (i) should record the effects of the changes from the TCJA for which the accounting is complete (not provisional), (ii) should record provisional amounts for the effects of the changes from the TCJA for which the accounting is not complete, and for which reasonable estimates can be determined, in the period they are identified, and (iii) should not record provisional amounts if reasonable estimates cannot be made for the effects of the changes from the TCJA, and should continue to apply guidance based on the tax law in effect prior to the enactment on December 22, 2017.  In addition, SAB 118 establishes a one-year measurement period (through December 22, 2018) where a provisional amount could be subject to adjustment, and requires certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to provisional amounts and accounting during the measurement period. The Company recorded a provisional charge for the Transition Tax of $325 million as a discrete item in the provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017.  Of this amount, $39 million and $286 million are included in Other accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.  The Transition Tax recorded is provisional pending the finalization of earnings estimates of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate, the Company remeasured its U.S. net deferred tax assets as of the enactment date and recognized a provisional charge of $51 million as a discrete item in the provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, which is a reduction in net deferred tax assets and is included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.  The measurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets is provisional as the final remeasurement cannot be determined until the underlying temporary differences are known, rather than estimated. In addition, as a result of the Transition Tax on unremitted foreign earnings, the Company now expects to repatriate certain foreign earnings, which will be subject to foreign withholding taxes.  Accordingly, the Company recorded a provisional charge of $18 million for the foreign withholding taxes as a discrete item in the provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 as a net deferred tax liability. This amount is a reduction in net deferred tax assets and is included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.  This charge is provisional due to uncertainty at this time related to the U.S. tax treatment of such foreign withholding taxes. The Company is continuing to analyze the impact of the TCJA.  Adjustments to the provisional charges will be recorded as discrete items in the provision for income taxes in the period in which those adjustments become reasonably estimable and/or the accounting is complete.  Such adjustments may result from, among other things, future guidance, interpretations and regulatory changes from the Internal Revenue Service, the SEC, the FASB and/or various tax jurisdictions.  The Company will complete its analysis no later than December 22, 2018. There are other potential impacts under the TCJA which are not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019.  These primarily include a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI""), the base erosion anti-abuse tax (""BEAT"") and the foreign derived intangibles income (""FDII"") provisions.  The Company has not recorded any impact associated with these provisions at this time. 8 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The effective rate for income taxes was 81.9% and 28.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  This increase was primarily attributable to the Transition Tax of approximately 4,710 basis points, the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets of approximately 740 basis points, and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to certain foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriation of approximately 260 basis points, with each resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.  Partially offsetting this increase was approximately 350 basis points, primarily reflecting a favorable geographic mix of earnings, as well as a favorable impact of the reduced U.S. statutory tax rate. The effective rate for income taxes was 55.2% and 27.6% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  This increase was primarily attributable to the Transition Tax of approximately 2,620 basis points, the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets of approximately 410 basis points, and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to certain foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriation of approximately 150 basis points, with each resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.  Partially offsetting this increase was approximately 420 basis points, primarily reflecting a favorable impact of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards, a favorable geographic mix of earnings, as well as a favorable impact of the reduced U.S. statutory tax rate. As of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaled $66 million and $68 million, respectively.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $46 million. The total gross accrued interest and penalty expense related to unrecognized tax benefits during the three months ended December 31, 2017 in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings was $1 million.  During the six months ended December 31, 2107, the Company recognized a gross interest and penalty benefit of $2 million in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings. The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 was $10 million and $13 million, respectively.  On the basis of the information available as of December 31, 2017, the Company does not expect any significant changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Other Accrued Liabilities Other accrued liabilities consist of the following: December 31             June 30               (In millions)             2017             2017               Advertising,   merchandising and sampling             $      466             $      319               Employee   compensation             427             522               Payroll and   other taxes             309             190               Accrued income   taxes             229             169               Other             821             599                             $      2,252             $      1,799 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Compensation - Stock Compensation In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changes the way companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. This new guidance requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based compensation awards be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.  In addition, companies are required to treat the tax effects of exercised or vested awards as discrete items in the period that they occur.  This guidance also permits an employer to withhold up to the maximum statutory withholding rates in a jurisdiction without triggering liability classification, allows companies to elect to account for forfeitures as they occur, and provides requirements for the cash flow classification of cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes and for the classification of excess tax benefits.  The new guidance prescribes different transition methods for the various provisions. 9 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Effective for the Company  -  Fiscal 2018 first quarter. Impact on consolidated financial statements  -  As a result of the adoption of this guidance, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized $1 million and $24 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits as a reduction to the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings.  Additionally, upon adoption the Company has included these excess tax benefits in cash flows from operating activities in the net earnings caption and will continue to classify cash paid for withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes in cash flows from financing activities.  This guidance was applied prospectively and prior-year periods have not been adjusted for these changes.  The Company will also continue to accrue for estimated forfeitures each quarter. Finally, as the Company has no outstanding awards classified as a liability due to withholding excess taxes, there was no impact to the Company's consolidated balance sheets related to the adoption of that portion of the guidance. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Hedge Accounting In August 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to simplify hedge accounting.  The amended guidance includes the following provisions: ·                  enables entities to better portray their risk management activities within the financial statements; ·                  expands an entity's ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components; ·                  reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk; ·                  eliminates the requirement to separately measure and disclose hedge ineffectiveness; ·                  requires the entire change in fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item; ·                  eases certain documentation and assessment requirements; ·                  modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness; and ·                  requires revised tabular footnote disclosure. The guidance also provides transition relief to make it easier for entities to apply certain amendments to existing hedges (including fair value hedges) where the hedge documentation is required to be modified. Effective for the Company  -  Fiscal 2020 first quarter, with early adoption permitted in any interim period.  The guidance must be applied: ·                  using the modified retrospective approach for cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption; and ·                  prospectively for the presentation and disclosure requirements. Impact on consolidated financial statements  -  The Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption and impact of applying this new hedge accounting. Pension-related Costs In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends how companies present net periodic benefit cost in the income statement and balance sheet relating to defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans.  Within the income statement, the new guidance requires companies to report the service cost component within operating expenses and report the other components of net periodic benefit cost below operating income (if one is reported).  In addition, within the balance sheet, the guidance changes the components of the pension cost eligible for capitalization to the service cost component only (e.g., as a cost of internally manufactured inventory or a self-constructed asset). Effective for the Company  -  Fiscal 2019 first quarter, with early adoption permitted as of the first interim period in fiscal 2018.  The guidance must be applied: ·                  retrospectively as it pertains to the income statement classification of the components of net periodic benefit cost; and ·                  prospectively as it pertains to future capitalization of service costs. Impact on consolidated financial statements  -  The Company will adopt this guidance when it becomes effective and although certain components of pension expense will be reclassified out of operating income, the Company does not believe this will have a material impact on reported operating income. 10 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Goodwill In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  The single quantitative step test requires companies to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  The Company will continue to have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Effective for the Company  -  Fiscal 2021 first quarter, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Impact on consolidated financial statements  -  The Company did not elect to apply this guidance to its fiscal 2017 impairment testing and will continue to assess the impact of adopting it on future interim and annual impairment tests. Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires companies to utilize an impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial instruments, which include trade and other receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, to record an allowance for credit risk based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.  In addition, this new guidance changes the recognition method for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities, which can occur as a result of market and credit risk, as well as additional disclosures.  In general, this guidance will require modified retrospective adoption for all outstanding instruments that fall under this guidance. Effective for the Company  -  Fiscal 2021 first quarter. Impact on consolidated financial statements  -  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance on its financial instruments, such as accounts receivable and short- and long-term investments. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheets with the liability being equal to the present value of the lease payments.  The right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability adjusted for certain costs such as direct costs.  Lease expense will be recognized similar to current accounting guidance with operating leases resulting in a straight-line expense, and financing leases resulting in a front-loaded expense similar to the current accounting for capital leases.  This guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements, and provides for certain practical expedients. Effective for the Company  -  Fiscal 2020 first quarter, with early adoption permitted. Impact on consolidated financial statements  -  The Company currently has an implementation team in place that is performing a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the adoption of this guidance.  While the Company has not completed its evaluation, it believes the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on its consolidated balance sheets.  As disclosed in Note 15  -  Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the Company had $2,427 million in future minimum lease commitments as of June 30, 2017.  Upon adoption, the Company's lease liability will generally be based on the present value of such payments, and the related right-of use asset will generally be based on the lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs. Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines how companies should report revenues from contracts with customers.  The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  It provides companies with a single comprehensive five-step principles-based model to use in accounting for revenue and supersedes current revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific and transaction-specific revenue guidance. 11 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the principal versus agent guidance in its new revenue recognition standard.  These amendments do not change the key aspects of the principal versus agent guidance, including the definition that an entity is a principal if it controls the good or service prior to it being transferred to a customer, but the amendments clarify the implementation guidance related to the considerations that must be made during the contract evaluation process. In April 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the new standard to clarify the guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarified certain terms, guidance and disclosure requirements during the transition period related to completed contracts and contract modifications.  In addition, the FASB provided clarification on the concept of collectability, the calculation of the fair value of noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. In May 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to reflect the SEC Staff's rescission of its prior comments that covered, among other things, accounting for shipping and handling costs and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer. In December 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends various aspects of the new standard to clarify certain terms, guidance and disclosure requirements.  In particular, the guidance addresses disclosure requirements for remaining performance obligations, impairment testing for contract costs and accrual of advertising costs, as well as clarifies several examples. Effective for the Company  -  Fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted.  An entity is permitted to apply the foregoing guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented, with certain practical expedients, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. Impact on consolidated financial statements  -  The Company will apply all of this new guidance when it becomes effective in fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective adoption method.  Although the Company has not yet completed its evaluation, it has preliminarily determined that certain promotional goods, such as samples and testers, will be reclassified from Selling, general and administrative expenses to Cost of Sales in the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  The Company has assessed its third-party retailer arrangements and noted that upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, the Company will have a change in the classification of certain payments to customers as well as a change in the timing of certain accruals for variable consideration.  Additionally, the Company's customer loyalty programs, which have historically been accounted for under the incremental cost approach, will be accounted for as a reduction of revenue based on the fair value of estimated future redemptions when the obligation is created (i.e. upon sale of the product to the consumer).  Furthermore, the Company is continuing to assess the impact that its promotional goods and loyalty programs will have on the timing of revenue recognition upon adoption.

NOTE 4  -  CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES In May 2016, the Company announced a multi-year initiative (""Leading Beauty Forward,"" ""LBF"" or the ""Program"") to build on its strengths and better leverage its cost structure to free resources for investment to continue its growth momentum.  LBF is designed to enhance the Company's go-to-market capabilities, reinforce its leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.  The Company plans to approve specific initiatives under LBF through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expects to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.  Inclusive of charges recorded from inception through December 31, 2017, the Company expects that LBF will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million before taxes.  In connection with LBF, at this time, the Company estimates a net reduction over the duration of LBF in the range of approximately 900 to 1,200 positions globally, which is about 2.5% of its current workforce. This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas. Program-to-Date Approvals Of the $600 million to $700 million restructuring and other charges expected to be incurred, total cumulative charges approved by the Company through December 31, 2017, some of which were recorded during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, were: Sales    Returns                           Operating Expenses                             (In millions)             (included in    Net Sales)             Cost of Sales             Restructuring Charges             Other    Charges             Total               Approval   Period                                                                                     Fiscal 2016             $      4             $      28             $      87             $      71             $      190               Fiscal 2017             11             10             132             118             271               Six months ended   December 31, 2017              -              4             75             36             115               Cumulative   through December 31, 2017             $      15             $      42             $      294             $      225             $      576 14 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

Accrued restructuring charges at December 31, 2017 are expected to result in cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations of approximately $67 million, $72 million, $23 million and $3 million for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and for each of fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. NOTE 5  -  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into option contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company's aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances.  The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and may use option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company's consolidated financial results. For each derivative contract entered into where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instruments' effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness.  This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.  The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedges and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.  If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively. 16 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries.  The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.  The Company may also enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize.  The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash-flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of December 2019.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a hypothetical derivative methodology and excludes the portion of fair value attributable to the spot-forward difference which is recorded in current-period earnings.  Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency option contracts is based on a dollar offset methodology. 18 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company's identified exposures.  The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance. The ineffective portion of both foreign currency forward and interest rate derivatives is recorded in current-period earnings.  For hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs.  If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period earnings.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company's foreign currency cash-flow hedges were highly effective. At December 31, 2017, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in the amount of $3,208 million.  The foreign currencies included in foreign currency forward contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the British pound ($521 million), Euro ($478 million), Swiss franc ($474 million), Hong Kong dollar ($334 million), Canadian dollar ($171 million), Japanese yen ($144 million), and Chinese yuan ($143 million). The estimated net loss on the Company's derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges as of December 31, 2017 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $24 million.  The accumulated net loss on derivative instruments in AOCI was $9 million and $4 million as of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. Fair-Value Hedges The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness. The Company has interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $250 million, $450 million and $250 million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2020 Senior Notes, 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on three-month LIBOR plus a margin.  These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair-value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. Credit Risk As a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies.  The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.  Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $8 million at December 31, 2017.  To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.  Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote. NOTE 6  -  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company records certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The accounting for fair value measurements must be applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that require initial measurement or remeasurement at fair value, which principally consist of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations and goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for the purposes of calculating potential impairment.  The Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date. Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Inputs reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument's valuation. 19 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company's financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash and cash equivalents  -  Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, money market funds and time deposits. The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily due to the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments. Available-for-sale securities  -  Available-for-sale securities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and are valued using third-party pricing services, and for time deposits, the carrying amount approximates fair value. To determine fair value, the pricing services use market prices or prices derived from other observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors. Foreign currency forward contracts  -  The fair values of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach.  The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service.  To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using LIBOR for contracts with maturities up to 12 months, and swap yield curves for contracts with maturities greater than 12 months. Interest rate swap contracts  -  The fair values of the Company's interest rate swap contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach.  The significant observable inputs to the model, such as treasury yield curves, swap yield curves and LIBOR forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services. Current and long-term debt  -  The fair value of the Company's debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities.  To a lesser extent, debt also includes capital lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value.  The Company's debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Additional purchase price payable  -  The Company's additional purchase price payable represents fixed minimum additional purchase price that was discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate, which was approximately 1%.  The additional purchase price payable is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Contingent consideration  -  Contingent consideration obligations consist of potential obligations related to the Company's acquisitions in previous years. The amounts to be paid under these obligations are contingent upon the achievement of stipulated financial targets by the business subsequent to acquisition. The fair values of the contingent consideration related to certain acquisition earn-outs were estimated using a probability-weighted discount model that considers the achievement of the conditions upon which the respective contingent obligation is dependent (""Monte Carlo Method""). The Monte Carlo Method has various inputs into the valuation model, in addition to the risk-adjusted projected future operating results of the acquired entities, which include the following ranges at December 31, 2017: Risk-adjusted discount rate             2.1% to 2.5%        Revenue volatility             3.4% to 7.5%        Asset volatility             22.0% to 24.1%        Revenue and   earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization correlation   coefficient factor             80.0%        Revenue discount rates             3.4% to 5.3%        Earnings before   income tax, depreciation and amortization discount rates             12.4% to 13.8% Significant changes in the projected future operating results would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.  Changes to the discount rates, volatilities or correlation factors would have a lesser effect.  The implied rates are deemed to be unobservable inputs and, as such, the Company's contingent consideration is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 21 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

Management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  However, management's assessment of the Company's current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings.  Reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for litigation and other legal proceedings are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. NOTE 9  -  STOCK PROGRAMS Total net stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the granting of, and the remaining requisite service periods of stock options, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), performance share units (""PSUs""), PSUs based on total stockholder return (""TSR""), long-term PSUs, and share units.  Compensation expense attributable to net stock-based compensation is as follows: Three Months Ended    December 31             Six Months Ended    December 31               (In millions)             2017             2016             2017             2016               Compensation   expense             $      75             $      46             $      132             $      134               Income tax   benefit             9             15             28             44 Beginning with September 2017 grants, the equity award agreements for employee equity grants contain a new provision regarding award forfeiture, the effect of which requires the recording of stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees over the new requisite service period (six months) rather than at the date of grant. Stock Options During the six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company granted approximately 2.1 million stock options with an exercise price per share of $108.20 and a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $27.76. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $122 million. Restricted Stock Units The Company granted approximately 1.2 million RSUs during the six months ended December 31, 2017 with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $107.93 which, at the time of grant, were scheduled to vest as follows: 0.4 million in fiscal 2019, 0.5 million in fiscal 2020 and 0.3 million in fiscal 2021.  Vesting of RSUs granted is generally subject to the continued employment or retirement of the grantees.  The RSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights, payable upon settlement of the RSUs either in cash or shares (based on the terms of the particular award) and, as such, were valued at the closing market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. 23 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Performance Share Units During the six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company granted PSUs with a target payout of approximately 0.2 million shares with a grant date fair value per share of $107.95, which will be settled in stock subject to the achievement of the Company's net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital goals for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 2020, all subject to continued employment or retirement of the grantees. For PSUs granted, no settlement will occur for results below the applicable minimum threshold.  PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSUs and, as such, were valued at the closing market value of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. In September 2017, approximately 0.2 million shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock were issued, and related accrued dividends were paid, relative to the target goals set at the time of the issuance, in settlement of 0.3 million PSUs which vested as of June 30, 2017. Performance Share Units Based on Total Stockholder Return In August 2017, 30,267 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock were issued, and related dividends were paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant related to the final performance period of the award, which ended June 30, 2017. NOTE 10  -  NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. PER COMMON SHARE Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share (""basic EPS"") is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions).  Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share assuming dilution (""diluted EPS"") is computed by reflecting potential dilution from stock-based awards. A reconciliation between the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows: Three Months Ended    December 31             Six Months Ended    December 31               (In millions, except per share data)             2017             2016             2017             2016               Numerator:                                                                       Net earnings   attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.             $      123             $      428             $      550             $      722                                                                                       Denominator:                                                                       Weighted-average   common shares outstanding  -  Basic             368.7             366.9             368.5             366.7               Effect of   dilutive stock options             5.1             3.7             4.8             4.0               Effect of PSUs             0.3             0.2             0.2             0.2               Effect of RSUs             2.0             1.8             2.2             2.0               Weighted-average   common shares outstanding  -  Diluted             376.1             372.6             375.7             372.9                                                                                       Net   earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. per common share:                                                                       Basic             $      .33             $      1.17             $      1.49             $      1.97               Diluted             .33             1.15             1.46             1.94 As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, outstanding options to purchase 2.0 million and 2.5 million shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 1.2 million shares and 0.8 million shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock underlying PSUs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on the achievement of certain performance targets of the Company, as discussed in Note 9  -  Stock Programs. 24 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 13  -  SEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION Reportable operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the ""Chief Executive"") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  Although the Company operates in one business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis.  Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring and other activities, and earnings before income taxes, interest expense, interest income and investment income, net, and charges associated with restructuring and other activities.  Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the product categories because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures. The accounting policies for the Company's reportable segments are substantially the same as those for the consolidated financial statements, as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.  The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein.  There has been no significant variance in the total or long-lived asset values associated with the Company's segment data since June 30, 2017. 27 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

The economics of developing, producing, launching, distributing, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.  The introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods.  While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 43 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States.  Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.  Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States.  Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.  We calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates. 30 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. Overview We believe the best way to increase stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing consumers' changing behaviors and shopping preferences.  We are guided by our long-term strategy, which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.  We plan to continue building upon and leveraging our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.  Elements of our strategy are described in the Overview on pages 24-28 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as well as below. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we continued to build global net sales momentum, fueled by our multiple engines of growth.  Net sales grew 17% as compared with the prior-year period, led by our skin care, makeup and fragrance product categories. We have seen a continued resurgence of global prestige skin care growth during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.  The Estée Lauder brand continued its acceleration in skin care and makeup, while La Mer, Tom Ford and Jo Malone London grew strong double digits.  Certain of our brands have benefited from new product introductions, which have created a halo effect on some of our hero product lines.  These lines generally consist of iconic products that are major components of our brands such as Advanced Night Repair from Estée Lauder.  Our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA contributed incremental sales that bolstered our growth in the makeup category and in the Americas region.  Internationally, net sales grew in substantially all of our markets, led by China, while our travel retail business continued to generate strong net sales increases.  We believe that part of our success has been due to our focus on strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution, as we continue to pivot towards areas of prestige beauty where we see the greatest opportunities. While our business is performing well overall, we continue to face strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries. In particular, we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to some brick-and-mortar stores in the United States as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.  We are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism.  Additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as Brazil and in the Middle East, the United Kingdom's anticipated exit from the European Union, social and political issues, geopolitical tensions and global security issues. We believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas of strength among our geographic regions, product categories, brands and channels of distribution.  However, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence, demand, spending and willingness or ability to travel and, as a result, on our business.  We will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recognized impairment charges for the goodwill and trademark related to its Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle reporting unit.  If the softness in the retail environment that impacted our growth projections for this reporting unit is more severe than we have anticipated, or other business disruptions arise, a resulting change in the long-term plans could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of the related goodwill and trademark, and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future.  As of December 31, 2017, the carrying values of the Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle goodwill and trademark were $6 million and $33 million, respectively.  Based on the latest quantitative assessment, as of April 1, 2017, the fair values of all other reporting units with material goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, with the exception of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values.  With regard to Too Faced and BECCA, the $1.3 billion combined carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values.  If these brands were adversely impacted by any number of factors (e.g., a soft retail environment for their products) that causes a change to their long-term financial projections from the financial targets set at the date of acquisition, there could be a negative effect on the fair values of these reporting units and, accordingly, could result in an impairment charge in the future. Our ""heritage brands"" are Estée Lauder, Clinique and Origins.  Our ""makeup artist brands"" are MAC and Bobbi Brown. Our ""luxury brands"" are La Mer, Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, AERIN, RODIN olio lusso, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and By Kilian.  Our ""designer fragrances"" are sold under the Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Kiton, Ermenegildo Zegna and Tory Burch brand names, which we license from their respective owners. 31 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. Leading Beauty Forward In May 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative (""Leading Beauty Forward"") to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum.  Leading Beauty Forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.  We plan to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.  Inclusive of charges recorded from inception through December 31, 2017, we expect that Leading Beauty Forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.  After its full implementation, we expect Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in Selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.  We expect to reinvest a portion of these savings in future growth initiatives.  For additional information about Leading Beauty Forward, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4  -  Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities.

For the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, reported net sales increased in each major product category and grew in each geographic region.  Skin care net sales primarily benefited from higher sales of Estée Lauder and La Mer products.  Incremental net sales from our fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, as well as net sales increases from MAC, Estée Lauder and Tom Ford, drove growth in the makeup product category.  Our fragrance category primarily benefited from net sales increases from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford.  Higher net sales from our fiscal 2016 and 2015 acquisitions of GLAMGLOW, By Kilian, Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle also contributed to growth in our skin care and fragrance categories.  Each of our product categories benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach, new product offerings, the continued success of certain hero franchises, growth from emerging markets, strength in our travel retail business and the specialty-multi and online channels. Returns associated with restructuring activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures. 32 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

Reported skin care net sales increased, reflecting higher net sales from Estée Lauder and La Mer, combined, of approximately $197 million and $371 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.  In both periods, the higher net sales from Estée Lauder were primarily due to increases in travel retail and China and to the launch of Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix, which created a halo effect on the Advanced Night Repair line of products.  Net sales of La Mer products grew in all regions in both periods, reflecting recent product launches such as The Moisturizing Matte Lotion and the expansion of the Genaissance line of products, including Genaissance Eye and Genaissance Infused Lotion.  Also contributing to the growth of La Mer was targeted expanded consumer reach, strength in our travel retail business and increased sales of existing products. Partially offsetting the increase in net sales for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, were lower net sales from Aveda of approximately $5 million and $11 million, respectively.  The lower net sales of Aveda products for both periods primarily reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prior-year periods due to the launch of the Tulasara line of products. The net sales increase for skin care included favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $33 million and $41 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.

Reported makeup net sales increased, reflecting incremental net sales from our fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA as well as higher net sales from Estée Lauder, MAC and Tom Ford which contributed approximately $196 million and $421 million of net sales, combined, to the growth in the makeup product category for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.  In both periods, increased net sales of Estée Lauder products were due, in part, to higher sales of Double Wear foundation products and the Pure Color franchise.  Higher net sales from MAC in both periods were driven by our travel retail business and the Asia/Pacific region, particularly in China and Hong Kong, reflecting growth in online sales and the strength of the makeup category in that region.  Net sales growth from Tom Ford in both periods, in particular from our travel retail business, was driven by higher sales of eyeshadow and lip color products. Partially offsetting these increases were approximately $3 million of lower net sales of Smashbox products for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and approximately $20 million of Clinique and Smashbox products, combined, for the six months ended December 31, 2017. The lower net sales of Smashbox and Clinique products were due, in part, to a soft retail environment for our products in certain brick-and-mortar stores in the United States reflecting slower retail traffic.  The lower net sales of Clinique products for the six months ended December 31, 2017 also reflected an unfavorable comparison due to the higher level of expansion within the specialty-multi channel in the prior-year period. The net sales increase for makeup included favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $38 million and $47 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.

Reported fragrance net sales increased for the three months ended December 31, 2017, reflecting higher net sales from our luxury fragrance brands and Estée Lauder of approximately $78 million, combined.  Higher fragrance net sales from Estée Lauder for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were primarily due to the timing of and strong demand for holiday sets, which occurred during the fiscal 2018 second quarter.  Reported fragrance net sales increased for the six months ended December 31, 2017, reflecting higher net sales from our luxury brands of approximately $115 million, combined. Contributing to the growth for both periods were higher net sales from Jo Malone London, primarily driven by the travel retail channel, as well as targeted expanded consumer reach and recent product launches, such as the English Oak fragrances.  Also contributing to the increase were higher net sales from Tom Ford, reflecting, in part, the continued success of the Private Blend franchises, including new products, such as the Oud Wood franchise, and growth from existing fragrances.  Net sales increased from Le Labo, By Kilian and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, reflecting targeted expanded consumer reach. Partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain of our designer fragrances of approximately $7 million and $23 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.  These lower net sales for both periods primarily reflected product rationalization of certain underperforming fragrances, as well as an unfavorable comparison with greater launch activity in the prior-year periods. The net sales increase for fragrance included favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $17 million and $22 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. 34 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

Reported net sales in the Americas for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $70 million and $196 million, respectively, due to incremental sales, primarily in the United States, from our fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, combined.  In addition, net sales in Latin America and Canada, combined, increased $17 million and $21 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.  Net sales growth from certain of our brands, including Estée Lauder and La Mer, also contributed to the higher net sales in the region. Excluding the incremental net sales from Too Faced and BECCA, net sales in the United States decreased approximately $21 million and $55 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, primarily reflecting lower net sales from M×A×C, Clinique and certain of our designer fragrances. The lower net sales from M×A×C reflected a softer retail environment for our products, as well as a difficult comparison to certain prior-year launches. The lower net sales of Clinique products primarily reflected an unfavorable comparison due to the higher level of expansion within the specialty-multi channel in the prior-year periods. The decrease in net sales of our designer fragrances reflected product rationalization of certain underperforming fragrances, as well as an unfavorable comparison with greater launch activity in the prior-year periods. 35 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

Reported net sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased, primarily reflecting higher sales from our travel retail business and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom of approximately $191 million and $373 million, combined, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.  In our travel retail business, the sales growth for both periods reflected higher net sales from most of our brands including Estée Lauder, Tom Ford, Jo Malone London, La Mer and MAC, driven, in part, by an increase in international passenger traffic, particularly by Chinese travelers, as well as targeted expanded consumer reach and new product offerings.  The higher net sales in the United Kingdom in both periods were primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting the net sales increase for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were lower net sales in the Middle East of approximately $5 million, primarily driven by the rebalancing of inventory levels by certain of our distributors caused by the impact of the macroeconomic environment on consumer purchases.

Reported net sales in Asia/Pacific increased, reflecting higher net sales in China and Hong Kong, combined, of approximately $183 million and $280 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.  In both periods, the higher net sales in China were led by Estée Lauder, MAC and La Mer, and reflected, in part, targeted expanded consumer reach, continued increased demand for makeup products and an acceleration in skin care.  In addition, all distribution channels grew, which were led by department stores and online.  The net sales growth in Hong Kong in both periods was primarily driven by Estée Lauder and La Mer, as well as by MAC, Tom Ford and Clinique, reflecting an increase in tourism, targeted expanded consumer reach and the continued success of certain hero franchises. Partially offsetting the net sales increase for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were lower net sales in Japan of approximately $4 million, primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.  Excluding this impact, net sales in Japan would have increased approximately $7 million, reflecting growth in tourism and the online channel. The net sales increase in Asia/Pacific included favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $19 million and $14 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. GROSS MARGIN Gross margin decreased to 79.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared with 80.1% in the prior-year period, and decreased to 79.1% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared with 79.7% in the prior-year period.  Favorable (unfavorable) basis point changes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the prior-year periods are as follows: December 31, 2017                             Three Months Ended             Six Months Ended               Foreign exchange   transactions             (5      )      (10      )        Mix of business             (10      )       -                Manufacturing   costs and other             30             25               Fiscal 2017   acquisitions             (55      )      (75      )        Subtotal             (40      )      (60      )        Charges   associated with restructuring and other activities             20              -                Total basis   point change             (20      )      (60      ) The unfavorable impact of the fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions for both periods was primarily due to a higher cost of sales related to Too Faced and BECCA, which for the six months ended December 31, 2017 also includes an inventory step-up adjustment of $6 million, or approximately 10 basis points related to Too Faced. 37 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 60.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and were flat as compared with the prior-year period, and decreased to 60.9% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared with 62.7% in the prior-year period.

Selling expenses for both periods were favorable, reflecting lower demonstration costs, partially due to changes in distribution channel mix. Beginning with September 2017 grants, equity award agreements for employee equity grants contain a new provision regarding award forfeiture, the effect of which requires the recording of stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees over the new requisite service period (six months).  Without this provision, the awards for retirement-eligible employees would have been expensed at the date of grant, rather than through our fiscal 2018 third quarter, and would have resulted in stock-based compensation expense having a favorable (unfavorable) impact on operating expense margin comparison of approximately 20 basis points and (10) basis points for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.

The reported operating margin for three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased from the prior-year period, as improvements in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were more than offset by the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as the lower gross margin, as previously noted. The reported operating margin for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased from the prior-year period, reflecting the lower operating expense margin, partially offset by the decrease in gross margin, as previously noted. Charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a Company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.  Accordingly, the following discussions of Operating Income by Product Categories and Geographic Regions exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities.

Reported operating income in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased for the three months ended December 31, 2017, reflecting higher results from our travel retail business and, to a lesser extent, South Africa of approximately $87 million, combined, primarily attributable to higher net sales.  Higher results in South Africa also reflected disciplined expense management. Reported operating income in Europe, the Middle East & Africa increased for the six months ended December 31, 2017, primarily attributable to higher results from our travel retail business and, to a lesser extent, Benelux of approximately $198 million, combined, reflecting higher net sales. The higher results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were partially offset by lower results in the United Kingdom, Germany and France of approximately $22 million, combined.  The lower results in the United Kingdom reflected the timing of shipments of holiday sets and gifts with purchase, which carry a higher cost of sales, as well as an increase in store operating costs as a result of targeted expanded consumer reach.  The lower results in Germany and France reflected higher spending on marketing, advertising and promotion behind new and existing products.  The higher results for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were partially offset by lower results in Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Middle East of approximately $42 million, combined.  The lower results in Switzerland were due to an unfavorable comparison to the prior-year period gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment.  The lower results in the United Kingdom were due, in part, to an increase in store operating costs as a result of targeted expanded consumer reach.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the tax impact of share-based compensation, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.  Our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the tax impact of share-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.  In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.

These impacts primarily consist of the following: ·                  A reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which will result in a fiscal 2018 U.S. blended statutory income tax rate for the Company of 28%. ·                  A one-time transitional repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings (""Transition Tax""), which may be paid over an eight-year period. ·                  The remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets as of the enactment date. For further discussion related to the TCJA, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1  -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  -  Income Taxes. The effective rate for income taxes was 81.9% and 28.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  This increase was primarily attributable to the Transition Tax of approximately 4,710 basis points, the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets of approximately 740 basis points, and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to certain foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriation of approximately 260 basis points, with each resulting from the enactment of the TCJA.  Partially offsetting this increase was approximately 350 basis points, primarily reflecting a favorable geographic mix of earnings, as well as a favorable impact of the reduced U.S. statutory tax rate.  Excluding the impact of the provisional adjustments under the TCJA noted above, and the favorable (unfavorable) impact on the effective tax rate from charges associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately (40) basis points and 60 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 would have been 24.4% and 28.9%, respectively. The effective rate for income taxes was 55.2% and 27.6% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  This increase was primarily attributable to the Transition Tax of approximately 2,620 basis points, the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets of approximately 410 basis points, and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to certain foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriation of approximately 150 basis points, with each resulting from the enactment of the TCJA. Partially offsetting this increase was approximately 420 basis points, primarily reflecting a favorable impact of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards, a favorable geographic mix of earnings, as well as a favorable impact of the reduced U.S. statutory tax rate.  Excluding the impact of the provisional adjustments under the TCJA noted above, and the favorable impact on the effective tax rate from charges associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately 10 basis points and 60 basis points for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 would have been 23.5% and 28.2%, respectively. 42 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or do not reflect the Company's underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period.  In the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to certain of those presented below; however, the impact to the Company's results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict.  Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies.  While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  The following tables present Net Sales, Operating Income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities, the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, the impact of the Transition Tax, the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to certain foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriation and the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets resulting from the TCJA, as well as the effects of foreign currency translation. 43 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad.  At December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,105 million compared with $1,136 million at June 30, 2017.  Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.  To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength, and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure. Our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  From time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  To the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available-for-sale securities, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.  Our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at December 31, 2017 include cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions. The recent enactment of the TCJA resulted in the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries and the changes in the tax law present potential opportunities to repatriate cash without additional U.S. federal income tax. Accordingly, we are in the process of analyzing the changes in the tax law and re-evaluating our indefinite reinvestment assertions with respect to our foreign earnings. We do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.  If these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to withholding taxes in certain jurisdictions. The effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years.  Generally, we have been able to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which have been moderate. Credit Ratings Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.  Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility.  Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.  A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  As of January 26, 2018, our commercial paper is rated A-1 by Standard & Poor's and P-1 by Moody's, and our long-term debt is rated A+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor's and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody's. 46 Table of Contents THE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.

Cash Flows Six Months Ended    December 31               (In millions)             2017             2016               Net cash   provided by operating activities             $      1,450             $      824               Net cash used   for investing activities             $      144             $      1,727               Net cash   provided by (used for) financing activities             $      (362      )      $      1,270 The change in net cash flows from operations primarily reflected higher earnings before income taxes and an increase in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, reflecting higher advertising and promotional accruals, an increase in accrued payroll and other taxes, and a change in legal accruals in the prior-year period.  The TCJA provisional charges, which lowered net earnings, contributed an additional increase of $325 million in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, reflecting the Transition Tax, as well as $69 million, combined, relating to deferred income taxes as a result of the revaluation of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the change in the corporate tax rate and the withholding taxes on planned repatriation.  The Transition Tax may be paid over an eight-year period, of which $39 million is classified as short-term.  These charges had no impact on our reported cash flows from operations for the six months ended December 31, 2017. The change in net cash flows from investing activities primarily reflected cash paid in the prior-year period for the fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures, primarily related to counters, and lower proceeds, net of purchases, of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy. The change in net cash flows from financing activities reflected the prior year issuance of commercial paper, which was primarily used to fund the acquisition of Too Faced. The change also reflected higher treasury stock purchases and dividends, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from stock-based compensation transactions. Dividends For a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the six months ended December 31, 2017, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11  -  Equity. Pension and Post-retirement Plan Funding There have been no significant changes to our pension and post-retirement funding as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Commitments, Contractual Obligations and Contingencies There have been no significant changes to our commitments and contractual obligations as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.

Market Risk We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  A hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $41 million and $26 million as of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively.  This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances.  Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by $29 million and $34 million as of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.  It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.  We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.  Our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, and income taxes.  Since June 30, 2017, there have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to our critical accounting policies.

Effective December 22, 2017, we changed our state of incorporation from Washington to Delaware. As of that date, the rights of the Company's stockholders began to be governed by the Delaware corporation laws, the Delaware Certificate of Incorporation, and the Delaware By-Laws. The Delaware Certificate of Incorporation and the Delaware Bylaws are filed herewith as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. Basis of Presentation  -  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Astrotech Corporation in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the six months ended December 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2018. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017. On Monday, October 16, 2017, the Company effectuated a reverse stock split of its shares of Common Stock whereby every five (5) pre-split shares of Common Stock were exchanged for one (1) post-split share of the Company's Common Stock (the ""Reverse Stock Split""). No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise have held a fractional share of the Common Stock received a cash payment in lieu thereof. In addition, the Company's authorized Common Stock was reduced from 75 million to 15 million shares. Accounting Pronouncements  -  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (Topic 606) (""ASU 2014-09""), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 605, Revenue Recognition (as updated by ASU 2015-14 in August 2015, ASU 2016-08 in March 2016, and ASU 2016-20 in December 2016). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step process to achieve that core principle. ASU 2014-09 requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 was to be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. ASU 2015-14 delayed the required adoption date for public entities to periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption to the original effective date under ASU 2014-09 is permitted. Once implemented, the Company can use one of two retrospective application methods for prior periods. Earlier application is not permitted. The Company has been assessing the impact of the new revenue recognition standard on its relationships with its clients. We have hired an outside consultant to help with the adoption of this standard. The Company will evaluate each contract as it commences in order to ensure its compliance with the new revenue standard. The Company plans to adopt this standard in fiscal year 2019. The Company has not yet determined the impacts of all the disclosure requirements and specifically is assessing the manner in which it will disaggregate its revenue to illustrate how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Additionally, while the Company is in the process of assessing its accounting and forecasting processes to ensure its ability to record, report, forecast, and analyze results under the new standard, it is not expecting significant changes to its business processes or systems. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, ""Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"" (""ASU 2016-01""). ASU 2016-01 modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value 7 Table of Contents in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicality exception. A practicality exception will apply to those equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under ASC 820, ""Fair Value Measurements,"" and as such these investments may be measured at cost. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have an impact on the Company's financial statements. The Company will adopt this ASU in fiscal year 2019. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)"" (""ASU 2016-02""). The new standard establishes a right-of-use (""ROU"") model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements and plans to adopt this ASU in fiscal year 2019. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, ""Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"" (""ASU 2016-13""). ASU 2016-13 amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, ASU 2016-13 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current generally accepted accounting standards, and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available-for-sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current generally accepted accounting standards; however, ASU 2016-13 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. This amendment affects loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, ""Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments"" (""ASU 2016-15""). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting"" (""ASU 2017-09""). ASU 2017-09 clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as a modification. The new guidance is expected to reduce diversity in practice and result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as a modification. Changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award that do not impact the fair value of the award, vesting conditions, and the classification as an equity or liability instrument will not need to be assessed under modification accounting. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Accordingly, the adoption of ASU 2017-09 will not have an effect on the Company's historical financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this standard on future consolidated financial statements. Our Business Units Astro Scientific Astro Scientific is a technology incubator that commercializes innovative technologies. Subsidiaries 1st Detect Corporation (""1st Detect"") and Astrogenetix, Inc. (""Astrogenetix"") currently reside in Astro Scientific: 1st Detect - 1st Detect is a manufacturer of advanced mass spectrometry technology used to detect and analyze explosives, chemical warfare agents (""CWAs""), and volatile organic compounds (""VOCs""). The Company offers technology with capabilities that exceed those of the currently deployed competitive solutions, providing laboratory-quality performance capable of detecting a wide range of threats with minimal to no false positives, rapid analysis time, and an easy user interface. The Company worked 8 Table of Contents with prime contractors in adapting our technology to be used in enhancing the government's detection capabilities for a variety of applications. Our efforts have resulted in a platform technology that has many diverse market opportunities, with the initial focus remaining on two key areas: • Security - Explosive device detection in airports:  There are currently approximately 25,000 ion mobility spectrometer (""IMS"") instruments installed today, with most nearing their end of life.  These IMS systems have many shortcomings - most notably their limited library of detectable compounds, inability to adapt to emerging threats, and significant false positive rates that extend security wait times. The 1st Detect TRACER 1000 provides significant enhancements, including: • Considerably expanded list of explosives, narcotics, and other compounds of interest; • Target library that can be instantaneously updated or expanded in the field without requiring hardware configuration changes; • Near-zero false positive rates; • Improved passenger satisfaction due to increased throughput at checkpoints; and • Similar market cost to current IMS explosives trace detectors (""ETD""). As the current generation of IMS technology is replaced, we are positioning the Company to be the best next-generation solution for this market. We recently completed a successful demo of our technology to the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration (""TSA"") personnel and are working on attaining acceptance of our product on TSA's qualified products list (""QPL""). • Healthcare - Breath analysis: We have partnered with UT Health San Antonio (""UTHSA"") in the development of the BreathDetect 1000, a mass spectrometry-based instrument that is being used to analyze human breath in real-time, enabling detection of bacterial infections in the respiratory tract within minutes. We have entered pre-clinical trials working with cystic fibrosis patients at UTHSA, focusing on identifying hospital-acquired pneumonia (""HAP""), one of the biggest and most expensive problems in hospitals with over 150,000 cases reported annually. Such identification can significantly enhance the physicians' ability to treat patients correctly. With current diagnosis methods, physicians wait up to three days for the lab to identify the organism, and another two days to receive the antibiotic resistance profile. In the meantime, they prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics, leading to the urgent public health threat of antibiotic resistance and contributing to the re-emergence of deadly diseases such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (""MRSA"").  The appropriate real-time diagnosis can lead to immediate administration of the appropriate antibiotics, reduce antibiotic resistance, decrease the length of hospital stays, and most importantly, save lives. Astrogenetix - Astrogenetix is applying a fast-track, on-orbit discovery platform using the International Space Station to develop vaccines. The Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland (""UMD""), one of the leading vaccinology institutions in the world, independently validated our target vaccine for Salmonella through funding provided by NASA. We are currently looking for funding to finance the pursuit of an Investigational New Drug (""IND"") application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA""). Astral Images Corporation Astral Images - Astral Images Corporation (""Astral"") is a developer of advanced film restoration and enhancement software. The Company offers significant cost savings to content owners who traditionally employ a laborious, inconsistent, and expensive manual frame-by-frame restoration process. At 24 frames-per-second, a full-length movie can easily have in excess of 200,000 frames, making manual conversion prohibitively expensive in some instances. Movie studios are at the precipice of a large shift to 4K and/or high dynamic rage (""HDR"") (collectively known as ultra-high definition (""UHD"")) content, and therefore, film assets will need to be rescanned and restored in order to remain relevant in the next generation of video content distribution through over the top (""OTT"") providers such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. Astral is positioned to lead this shift using its powerful artificial intelligence (""AI"") algorithms that remove dust, scratches, and defects from film while converting the content to a digital format with significantly enhanced resolution. In addition, the intelligent software automatically restores the film's original color, optimizing the content to be viewed in 4K. Coupled with Astral's HDR technology, which maximizes the contrast ratio, or the difference in light intensity from the darkest blacks and brightest whites, and a significantly expanded color gamut (1.06 billion available colors instead of 16 million), Astral's technology yields a result that we believe is optimized for today's most state of the art televisions. 9 Table of Contents This same technology is being applied to film held at film archives and museums with significant film collections throughout the world. This market is less driven by optimizing content for the latest standards and more concerned with preserving their treasured film assets. Film degrades over time, colors fade, buckling occurs, the film becomes brittle and eventually turns to dust, and in some cases, it becomes combustible. Astral provides a solution for such entities as they tend to be more cost conscious than film studios, and Astral's automated process is much less expensive than manual restoration. Finally, Astral's versatile AI platform technology will be applied to digitize and restore the 1.7 trillion photographs, negatives, and slides that are deteriorating in attics, basements, and cupboards around the world. With its advanced technology, Astral disrupts the photograph digitization market, where currently, scanned photographs are digitized in their existing and often poor condition, and expensive manual labor is employed for any restoration requests. In contrast, using its sophisticated algorithms, Astral restores the film to its original color and condition as part of the automated digitization process. (2) Going Concern Financial Condition The Company's consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has working capital of $6.9 million. The Company reported a net loss of $11.6 million for the fiscal year 2017 and a net loss of $6.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, along with net cash used in operating activities of $8.8 million for the fiscal year 2017 and net cash used in operating activities of $5.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017. This raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, but the Company remains resolute in identifying the optimal solution to the liquidity issue. Management's Plans to Continue as a Going Concern Management continues to pursue many options for its capital requirements to maximize shareholder value.  These include, but are not limited to, selling the Company or a portion thereof, debt financing, equity financing, merging, or engaging in a strategic partnership. In addition, the Company engaged Chardan Capital Markets on June 8, 2016 to explore strategic alternatives; this engagement is ongoing. Astrotech's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 do not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute the Company's plans to improve its ability to continue as a going concern. (3) Investments We use the specific identification method when determining realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities. The following tables summarize unrealized gains and losses related to our investments: Available-for-Sale   December 31, 2017 (In thousands)   Adjusted   Unrealized   Unrealized   Fair     Cost   Gain   Loss   Value Mutual Funds - Corporate & Government Debt   $ 5,454     $  -      $ (54 )   $ 5,400   Fixed Income Bonds   2,342     1     (7 )   2,336   Time Deposits   799      -      (2 )   797   Total   $ 8,595     $ 1     $ (63 )   $ 8,533 June 30, 2017     Adjusted   Unrealized   Unrealized   Fair     Cost   Gain   Loss   Value Mutual Funds - Corporate & Government Debt   $ 9,104     $  -      $ (61 )   $ 9,043   Fixed Income Bonds   3,048      -       -      3,048   Time Deposits   799      -       -      799   Total   $ 12,951     $  -      $ (61 )   $ 12,890 10 Table of Contents For information on the unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale investments reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into the consolidated statements of income, see ""Note 9: Other Comprehensive Loss."" We have certain financial instruments on our condensed consolidated balance sheet related to interest-bearing time deposits and fixed income bonds. These time deposits are included in ""Short-term Investments"" if the maturities at the end of the reporting period were 360 days or less or ""Long-term Investments"" if the maturities at the end of the reporting period were over 360 days. Fixed income investments, maturing over the next one to three years, are comprised of investment-grade fixed income securities in various corporations with ratings of BB- or better. The following table presents the carrying amounts of certain financial instruments as of December 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017: Carrying Value     Short-Term Investments   Long-Term Investments (In thousands)   December 31, 2017   June 30, 2017   December 31, 2017   June 30, 2017 Mutual Funds - Corporate & Government Debt   $ 5,400     $ 9,043     $  -      $  -    Time deposits                 Maturities from 1-90 days    -       -       -       -    Maturities from 91-360 days   251     250      -       -    Maturities over 360 days    -       -      546     549   Fixed Income Bonds                 Maturities less than 1 year   1,627     1,607      -       -    Maturities from 1-3 years    -       -      709     1,441   Maturities from 3-5 years    -       -       -       -    Total   $ 7,278     $ 10,900     $ 1,255     $ 1,990 (4) Inventory As the Company's primary focus changes from the MMS-1000™ to the TRACER 1000, the majority of the inventory associated with the MMS-1000™ was written-off during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The following table summarizes the components of our inventory balances, net of allowance of $9 thousand and $116 thousand at December 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, respectively: (In thousands)   December 31, 2017   June 30, 2017 Raw materials   $ 10     $ 109   Work in process    -      57   Total inventory   $ 10     $ 166 (5) Noncontrolling Interest Astral was created in conjunction with a noncontrolling interest, resulting in Astrotech initially owning 72% of Astral; the Company now owns 100% of Astral. 11 Table of Contents The following table details the contributions from the Company and the minority interest owner and the Company's ownership percentage of Astral: (In thousands) ASTC Contribution   Minority Owner   ASTC     Ownership (1) Initial investment $ 1,422     $ 422     72 % Additional contributions made in fiscal year 2015 1,000      -      83 % Additional contributions made in fiscal year 2016 3,000      -      92 % Additional contributions made in fiscal year 2017 3,500     (422 )   100 % Total Contributions $ 8,922     $  -                    (1) Astrotech acquired full ownership of Astral Images in fiscal year 2017. The Company previously applied noncontrolling interest accounting, which required us to clearly identify the noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company previously disclosed three measures of net loss: net loss, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, and net loss attributable to Astrotech Corporation. The Company's operating cash flows in its consolidated statements of cash flows reflect net loss, while our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations reflect net loss attributable to Astrotech Corporation. The following table breaks down the changes in Stockholders' Equity for the six months ended December 31, 2017: (In thousands)   Total Stockholders' Equity Balance at June 30, 2017   $ 16,770   Stock based compensation   242   Share repurchases   (3 ) Net change on available-for-sale investments   (1 ) Net loss attributable to Astrotech Corporation   (6,143 ) Balance at December 31, 2017   $ 10,865 (6) Net Loss per Share Basic net loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and the if-converted method. Potentially dilutive common shares include outstanding stock options and share-based awards. 12 Table of Contents The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used in the computations of both basic and diluted net loss per share: Three Months Ended   December 31,   Six Months Ended   December 31, (In thousands, except per share data)   2017   2016   2017   2016 Numerator:                 Amounts attributable to Astrotech Corporation, basic and diluted:                 Loss before income taxes   $ (3,137 )   $ (2,654 )   $ (6,143 )   $ (6,121 ) Income tax benefit    -       -       -       -    Net loss   (3,137 )   (2,654 )   (6,143 )   (6,121 ) Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest    -      (51 )    -      (103 ) Net loss attributable to Astrotech Corporation   $ (3,137 )   $ (2,603 )   $ (6,143 )   $ (6,018 ) Denominator:                 Denominator for basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Astrotech Corporation  -  weighted average common stock outstanding   4,060     4,124     4,059     4,125   Basic and diluted net loss per common share:                     Net loss attributable to Astrotech Corporation   $ (0.77 )   $ (0.63 )   $ (1.51 )   $ (1.46 ) All unvested restricted stock awards for the six months ended December 31, 2017, are not included in diluted net loss per share, as the impact to net loss per share would be anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 363,057 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $1.60 to $16.00 per share outstanding as of December 31, 2017, were not included in diluted net loss per share, as the impact to net loss per share would be anti-dilutive. On Monday, October 16, 2017, the Company effectuated a reverse stock split of its shares of Common Stock whereby every five (5) pre-split shares of Common Stock were exchanged for one (1) post-split share of the Company's Common Stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise have held a fractional share of the Common Stock received a cash payment in lieu thereof. Numbers presented in these financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. (7) Revenue Recognition Astrotech recognizes revenue employing two generally accepted revenue recognition methodologies. The methodology used is based on contract type and the manner in which products and services are provided. Production Unit Sales and Software Licensing Agreements When revenue for sale of manufactured product is commenced or when we license our software for use, we will recognize it when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when a firm sales contract or invoice is in place, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, and collectability is reasonably assured. Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts Most of the Company's revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture mass spectrometers to a buyer's specification. These contracts are accounted for under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 605-35 ""Revenue Recognition: Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts."" These contracts are fixed-price and are recorded on the percentage-of-completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition. Any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately. Contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract costs, and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues. With respect to contract change orders, claims, or similar items, judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. The Company enters into fixed-priced subcontracts on government projects that are one to two years long. Revenue from certain long-term, integrated project management contracts to provide new prototypes and completion services is reported on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. At the outset of each contract, we prepare a detailed analysis of our estimated cost to complete the project, and our progress is based on the percentage of projected cost incurred. Risks related to service delivery, 13 Table of Contents usage, productivity, and other factors are considered in the estimation process. The recording of profits and losses on long-term contracts requires an estimate of the total profit or loss over the life of each contract. This estimate requires consideration of total contract value, change orders, and claims, less costs incurred and estimated costs to complete. Anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in full in the period in which they become evident. Profits are recorded based upon the total estimated contract profit times the current percentage complete for the contract. (8) Fair Value Measurement The accounting standard for fair value measurements defines fair value, establishes a market-based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard is applicable whenever assets and liabilities are measured and included in the financial statements at fair value. The fair value hierarchy established in the standard prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels as follows: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The following tables present the carrying amounts, estimated fair values, and valuation input levels of certain financial instruments as of December 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017: December 31, 2017     Carrying   Fair Value Measured Using   Fair (in thousands)   Amount   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Value Available-for-Sale Securities                     Mutual Funds - Corporate & Government Debt   $ 5,400     $ 5,400     $  -      $  -      $ 5,400   Bonds: 0-1 year   1,627      -      1,627      -      1,627   Bonds: 1-3 years   709      -      709      -      709   Time deposits: 91-360 days   251      -      251      -      251   Time deposits: over 360 days   546      -      546      -      546   Total   $ 8,533     $ 5,400     $ 3,133     $  -      $ 8,533 June 30, 2017     Carrying   Fair Value Measured Using   Fair (in thousands)   Amount   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   Value Available-for-Sale Securities                     Mutual Funds - Corporate & Government Debt   $ 9,043     $ 9,043     $  -      $  -      $ 9,043   Bonds: 0-1 year   1,607      -      1,607      -      1,607   Bonds: 1-3 years   1,441      -      1,441      -      1,441   Time deposits: 91-360 days   250      -      250      -      250   Time deposits: over 360 days   549      -      549      -      549   Total   $ 12,890     $ 9,043     $ 3,847     $  -      $ 12,890 The value of our available-for-sale investments is based on pricing from third-party pricing vendors, who may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs). The fair value of our bonds and time deposits with maturities less than 90 days is considered the amortized value; the fair value measurements used for bonds and time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days is considered Level 2 and uses pricing from third-party pricing vendors who use quoted prices for identical or similar securities in both active and inactive markets. 14 Table of Contents (9) Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in the balances of each component included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the six months ended December 31, 2017, are presented below.

During the three and six months ended December 31, 2016, the Company had two customers that together comprised 100% of the Company's revenue. The following tables summarize the concentrations of sales and trade accounts receivable percentages for the Company's customers: Three Months Ended   December 31, 2017   Three Months Ended   December 31, 2016     Percentage of Total Sales   Percentage of Total Sales Next Generation Chemical Detector Partner    -  %   37 % Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Partner    -  %   63 % Large Post-Production Film Company   100 %    -  % Six Months Ended   December 31, 2017   Six Months Ended   December 31, 2016     Percentage of Total Sales   Percentage of Total Sales Next Generation Chemical Detector Partner    -  %   53 % Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Partner    -  %   47 % Large Post-Production Film Company   100 %    -  % December 31, 2017   June 30, 2017     Percentage of Trade A/R   Percentage of Trade A/R Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Partner    -  %   100 % The Company maintains funds in bank accounts that may exceed the limit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (""FDIC"") of $250 thousand per depositor. The risk of loss attributable to these uninsured balances is mitigated by depositing funds in what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. 15 Table of Contents (11) Common Stock Incentive, Stock Purchase Plans, and Other Compensation Plans Stock Option Activity Summary The Company's stock option activity for the six months ended December 31, 2017, is as follows: Shares (in thousands)   Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at June 30, 2017 365     $ 6.07   Granted  -       -    Exercised  -       -    Canceled or expired 2     5.30   Outstanding at December 31, 2017 363     $ 6.07 The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable at December 31, 2017, was $30 thousand as the fair value of the Company's common stock is more than the exercise prices of these options. The remaining share-based compensation expense of $483 thousand related to stock options will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.28 years. The table below details the Company's stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2017: Range of exercise prices   Number Outstanding   Options Outstanding Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (years)   Weighted- Average Exercise Price   Number Exercisable   Options Exercisable Weighted- Average Exercise Price $1.60  -  3.55   77,550     2.86   $ 3.11     77,550     $ 3.11   $5.30  -  8.35   268,507     8.17   6.30     86,000     6.59   $16.00  -  16.00   17,000     7.27   16.00     12,264     16.00   $1.60  -  16.00   363,057     6.99   $ 6.07     175,814     $ 5.57 Compensation costs recognized related to stock option awards were $67 thousand and $18 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively and $134 thousand and $37 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Restricted Stock The Company's restricted stock activity for the six months ended December 31, 2017, is as follows: Shares (in thousands)   Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding at June 30, 2017   56     $ 9.95   Granted    -       -    Vested   6     9.22   Canceled or expired   3     8.35   Outstanding at December 31, 2017   47     $ 10.16 Stock compensation expenses related to restricted stock were $54 thousand and $74 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively and $108 thousand and $917 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The remaining share-based compensation expense of $139 thousand related to restricted stock awards granted will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.16 years. 16 Table of Contents Securities Repurchase Program On December 13, 2014, the Board of Directors amended the share repurchase program to allow for the repurchase of up to $5 million in Astrotech Corporation stock until December 31, 2015. On December 3, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the extension of the share repurchase program through December 31, 2016. The share repurchase program ended as of December 31, 2016; as such, during the six months ended December 31, 2017, no shares were repurchased as part of the share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had repurchased 37,727 shares of common stock at a cost of $492 thousand, which represents an average cost of $13.05 per share. Shares Repurchased from Related Parties In August 2016, the Company repurchased 38,400 shares issued to the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer related to their tax withholding obligations at a cost of $308 thousand, which represents an average cost of $8.00 per share. In December 2016, the Company repurchased 120,370 shares from the Chief Executive Officer at a cost of $975 thousand, which represents an average cost of $8.10 per share. (12) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, the Company established a full valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company incurred pre-tax losses in the amount of $3.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively. For each of the six months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company incurred pre-tax losses in the amount of $6.1 million. The total effective tax rate was approximately 0% for each of the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016. For each of the six months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company's effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to recording of the valuation allowance placed against its net deferred tax assets. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. In the second quarter, the Company revised its estimated annual effective rate to reflect a change in its federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%. The rate change is effective on January 1, 2018; therefore, the Company's blended statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, is 27.52%. At December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed its accounting for all of the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, a reasonable estimate has been made. Note that the Company currently has net operating loss carryovers. A valuation allowance has been recorded to fully reserve for net operating loss carryovers, other carryovers, and book/tax differences on the balance sheet. FASB ASC 740, ""Income Taxes"" addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The Company had an unrecognized tax benefit of $0 for each of the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016. Loss carryovers are generally subject to modification by tax authorities until three years after they have been utilized; as such, the Company is subject to examination for the fiscal years ended 2000 through present for federal purposes and fiscal years ended 2006 through present for state purposes. The reason for this extended examination period is due to the utilization of the loss carryovers generated by the sale of our Astrotech Space Operations business unit in fiscal year 2015. (13) Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to various lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time, the Company receives communications from government or regulatory agencies concerning investigations or allegations of noncompliance with laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company establishes reserves for the estimated losses on specific contingent liabilities, for regulatory and legal actions where the Company deems a loss to be probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In other instances, the Company 17 Table of Contents is not able to make a reasonable estimate of liability because of the uncertainties related to the outcome or the amount or range of potential loss. Litigation, Investigations, and Audits  -  We are not party to, nor are our properties the subject of, any material pending legal proceedings. (14) Segment Information The Company currently has two reportable business units: Astro Scientific and Astral. Astro Scientific Astro Scientific is a technology incubator that commercializes innovative technologies. Subsidiaries 1st Detect and Astrogenetix currently reside in Astro Scientific: 1st Detect - 1st Detect is a manufacturer of advanced mass spectrometry technology used to detect and analyze explosives, CWAs, and VOCs. The Company offers technology with capabilities that exceed those of the currently deployed competitive solutions, providing laboratory-quality performance capable of detecting a wide range of threats with minimal to no false positives, rapid analysis time, and an easy user interface. The Company worked with prime contractors in adapting our technology to be used in enhancing the government's detection capabilities for a variety of applications. Astrogenetix - Astrogenetix is applying a fast-track, on-orbit discovery platform using the International Space Station to develop vaccines. The Center for Vaccine Development at UMD, one of the leading vaccinology institutions in the world, independently validated our target vaccine for Salmonella through funding provided by NASA. We are currently looking for funding to finance the pursuit of an IND application with the FDA. Astral Images Astral Images - Astral is a developer of advanced film restoration and enhancement software. The Company offers significant cost savings to content owners who traditionally employ a laborious, inconsistent, and expensive manual frame-by-frame restoration process. At 24 frames-per-second, a full-length movie can easily have in excess of 200,000 frames, making manual conversion prohibitively expensive in some instances. Movie studios are at the precipice of a large shift to 4K and/or HDR (collectively known as UHD) content, and therefore, film assets will need to be rescanned and restored in order to remain relevant in the next generation of video content distribution through OTT providers such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. Astral is positioned to lead this shift using its powerful AI algorithms that remove dust, scratches, and defects from film while converting the content to a digital format with significantly enhanced resolution. In addition, the intelligent software automatically restores the film's original color, optimizing the content to be viewed in 4K. Coupled with Astral's HDR technology, which maximizes the contrast ratio, or the difference in light intensity from the darkest blacks and brightest whites, and a significantly expanded color gamut (1.06 billion available colors instead of 16 million), Astral's technology yields a result that we believe is optimized for today's most state of the art televisions. This same technology is being applied to film held at film archives and museums with significant film collections throughout the world. This market is less driven by optimizing content for the latest standards and more concerned with preserving their treasured film assets. Film degrades over time, colors fade, buckling occurs, the film becomes brittle and eventually turns to dust, and in some cases, it becomes combustible. Astral provides a solution for such entities as they tend to be more cost conscious than film studios, and Astral's automated process is much less expensive than manual restoration. Finally, Astral's versatile AI platform technology will be applied to digitize and restore the 1.7 trillion photographs, negatives, and slides that are deteriorating in attics, basements, and cupboards around the world. With its advanced technology, Astral disrupts the photograph digitization market, where currently, scanned photographs are digitized in their existing and often poor condition, and expensive manual labor is employed for any restoration requests. In contrast, using its sophisticated algorithms, Astral restores the film to its original color and condition as part of the automated digitization process. All intercompany transactions between business units have been eliminated in consolidation. 18 Table of Contents Key financial metrics of the Company's segments are as follows: Three Months Ended   December 31, 2017   Three Months Ended   December 31, 2016       Revenue, Depreciation, and Income (In thousands)   Revenue   Depreciation   Loss before Income Taxes   Revenue   Depreciation   Loss before Income Taxes Astro Scientific   $  -      $ 87     $ (2,588 )   $ 520     $ 93     $ (1,976 ) Astral   41     97     (549 )    -      80     (678 ) Total   $ 41     $ 184     $ (3,137 )   $ 520     $ 173     $ (2,654 ) Six Months Ended   December 31, 2017   Six Months Ended   December 31, 2016       Revenue, Depreciation, and Income (In thousands)   Revenue   Depreciation   Loss before Income Taxes   Revenue   Depreciation   Loss before Income Taxes Astro Scientific   $  -      $ 207     $ (5,017 )   $ 1,526     $ 184     $ (4,762 ) Astral   41     179     (1,126 )    -      160     (1,359 ) Total   $ 41     $ 386     $ (6,143 )   $ 1,526     $ 344     $ (6,121 ) December 31, 2017   June 30, 2017 Assets (In thousands)   Fixed Assets, Net   Total Capital Expenditures (1)   Total Assets   Fixed Assets, Net   Total Capital Expenditures (2)   Total Assets Astro Scientific   $ 1,025     $ 8     $ 10,478     $ 1,224     $ 468     $ 16,833   Astral   1,783     6     1,869     1,956     31     2,002   Total   $ 2,808     $ 14     $ 12,347     $ 3,180     $ 499     $ 18,835                             (1)  Total capital expenditures are for the six months ended December 31, 2017.

RISK FACTORS We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this Item.","ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Business Overview Astrotech Corporation (Nasdaq: ASTC) (""Astrotech,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" or ""our""), a Delaware corporation organized in 1984, is an innovative science and technology development and commercialization company that invents, acquires, and commercializes technological innovations sourced from internal research, universities, laboratories, and research institutions, and then funds, manages, and builds start-up companies for profitable divestiture to market leaders to maximize shareholder value. Effective December 22, 2017, we changed our state of incorporation from Washington to Delaware. As of that date, the rights of the Company's stockholders began to be governed by the Delaware corporation laws, the Delaware Certificate of Incorporation, and the Delaware By-Laws. The Delaware Certificate of Incorporation and the Delaware Bylaws are filed herewith as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. The Company currently operates two reportable business units, Astro Scientific and Astral Images Corporation, and their efforts are focused on the following: Astro Scientific • 1st Detect Corporation (""1st Detect"") is a manufacturer of chemical detection and analysis instrumentation. Our next-generation solutions enable high performance trace detection of critical threats or compounds of interest to the security, defense, and healthcare markets using a small, fast, and inexpensive platform. The Company has engaged Chardan Capital Markets, LLC to help maximize shareholder value at 1st Detect by investigating strategic alternatives and these efforts are ongoing. • Astrogenetix, Inc. (""Astrogenetix"") is developing next-generation vaccines using the unique environment of microgravity. Astral Images Corporation • Astral Images Corporation (""Astral"") is a developer of advanced film restoration and enhancement software.  Astral is working with movie studios to convert their film assets to the latest 4K high dynamic range (""HDR"") standards while restoring the film in automation. We are also working with film archives and museums to preserve their treasured film assets by converting the content to a digital format and using our artificial intelligence (""AI"") platform to restore the assets.  Finally, we are employing the same technology to digitize the 1.7 trillion photographs, negatives, and slides that are deteriorating in attics, basements, and cupboards around the world. Our Business Units Astro Scientific Astro Scientific is a technology incubator that commercializes innovative technologies. Subsidiaries 1st Detect and Astrogenetix currently reside in Astro Scientific: 1st Detect - 1st Detect is a manufacturer of advanced mass spectrometry technology used to detect and analyze explosives, chemical warfare agents (""CWAs""), and volatile organic compounds (""VOCs""). The Company offers technology with capabilities that exceed those of the currently deployed competitive solutions, providing laboratory-quality performance capable of detecting a wide range of threats with minimal to no false positives, rapid analysis time, and an easy user interface. The Company worked with prime contractors in adapting our technology to be used in enhancing the government's detection capabilities for a variety of applications. Our efforts have resulted in a platform technology that has many diverse market opportunities, with the initial focus remaining on two key areas: • Security - Explosive device detection in airports:  There are currently approximately 25,000 ion mobility spectrometer (""IMS"") instruments installed today, with most nearing their end of life.  These IMS systems have many shortcomings - 21 Table of Contents most notably their limited library of detectable compounds, inability to adapt to emerging threats, and significant false positive rates that extend security wait times. The 1st Detect TRACER 1000 provides significant enhancements, including: • Considerably expanded list of explosives, narcotics, and other compounds of interest; • Target library that can be instantaneously updated or expanded in the field without requiring hardware configuration changes; • Near-zero false positive rates; • Improved passenger satisfaction due to increased throughput at checkpoints; and • Similar market cost to current IMS ETDs. As the current generation of IMS technology is replaced, we are positioning the Company to be the best next-generation solution for this market. We recently completed a successful demo of our technology to DHS and TSA personnel and are working on attaining acceptance of our product on TSA's qualified products list (""QPL""). • Healthcare - Breath analysis: We have partnered with UT Health San Antonio (""UTHSA"") in the development of the BreathDetect 1000, a mass spectrometry-based instrument that is being used to analyze human breath in real-time, enabling detection of bacterial infections in the respiratory tract within minutes. We have entered pre-clinical trials working with cystic fibrosis patients at UTHSA, focusing on identifying hospital-acquired pneumonia (""HAP""), one of the biggest and most expensive problems in hospitals with over 150,000 cases reported annually. Such identification can significantly enhance the physicians' ability to treat patients correctly. With current diagnosis methods, physicians wait up to three days for the lab to identify the organism, and another two days to receive the antibiotic resistance profile. In the meantime, they prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics, leading to the urgent public health threat of antibiotic resistance and contributing to the re-emergence of deadly diseases such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (""MRSA"").  The appropriate real-time diagnosis can lead to immediate administration of the appropriate antibiotics, reduce antibiotic resistance, decrease the length of hospital stays, and most importantly, save lives. Astrogenetix - Astrogenetix is applying a fast-track, on-orbit discovery platform using the International Space Station to develop vaccines. The Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland (""UMD""), one of the leading vaccinology institutions in the world, independently validated our target vaccine for Salmonella through funding provided by NASA. We are currently looking for funding to finance the pursuit of an Investigational New Drug (""IND"") application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"").

Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""U.S. GAAP""). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes there have been no significant changes during the six months ended December 31, 2017 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results of Operations Three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to three months ended December 31, 2016: Selected consolidated financial data for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 is as follows: Quarter Ended December 31, (In thousands)   2017   2016 Revenue   $ 41     $ 520   Cost of revenue   24     319   Gross profit   17     201   Gross margin   41 %   39 % Operating expenses:         Selling, general and administrative   1,602     1,636   Research and development   1,582     1,254   Total operating expenses   3,184     2,890   Loss from operations   (3,167 )   (2,689 ) Interest and other income, net   30     35   Income tax benefit    -       -    Net loss   (3,137 )   (2,654 ) Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest    -      (51 ) Net loss attributable to Astrotech Corporation   $ (3,137 )   $ (2,603 ) Revenue  -  Total revenue decreased $0.5 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  The revenue generated in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was from a software license agreement with a large post-production film company. This agreement was used to correct defects and restore one film. The majority of the revenue generated in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was associated with research-based, fixed-price, government-related subcontract agreements. These subcontract agreements ended during the last quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross Profit  -  Gross profit is comprised of revenue less cost of revenue. In the current quarter, cost of revenue is comprised of labor and depreciation related to the licensing of our software. In the prior quarter, cost of revenue was comprised of labor, materials, and overhead related to products manufactured for the subcontract agreements. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, cost of revenues decreased to $24 thousand from $319 thousand in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and gross profit decreased $184 thousand during the same period due to the decrease in revenue as described above. Operating Expenses  -  Operating expenses increased $294 thousand during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Selling, general and administrative remained consistent and research and development increased $328 thousand due to our focus on refining our new products which are currently in government testing. 23 Table of Contents Income Taxes  -  Income tax benefit did not change during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  The realization of tax benefits depends on the existence of future taxable income. Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") ""Income Taxes"" (""FASB ASC 740""), a valuation allowance has been established to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. Results of Operations Six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to six months ended December 31, 2016: Selected consolidated financial data for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands): Six Months Ended   December 31,     2017   2016 Revenue   $ 41     $ 1,526   Cost of revenue   24     1,050   Gross profit   17     476   Gross margin   41 %   31 % Operating expenses:         Selling, general and administrative   3,034     4,184   Research and development   3,226     2,546   Total operating expenses   6,260     6,730   Loss from operations   (6,243 )   (6,254 ) Interest and other expense, net   100     133   Income tax benefit    -       -    Net loss   (6,143 )   (6,121 ) Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest    -      (103 ) Net loss attributable to Astrotech Corporation   $ (6,143 )   $ (6,018 ) Revenue  -  Total revenue decreased $1.5 million during the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016.  The revenue generated during the six months ended December 31, 2017 was from a software license agreement with a large post-production film company. This agreement was used to correct defects and restore one film.  All of the revenue generated in the six months ended December 31, 2016 was associated with research-based, fixed-price, government-related subcontract agreements. These subcontract agreements ended during the last quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross Profit  -  Gross profit is comprised of revenue less cost of revenue. In the current year, cost of revenue is comprised of labor and depreciation related to the licensing of our software. In the prior year, cost of revenue was comprised of labor, materials, and overhead related to products manufactured for the subcontract agreements.  During the six months ended December 31, 2017, cost of revenues decreased to $24 thousand from $1.1 million in the six months ended December 31, 2016. Also, gross profit decreased $459 thousand during the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016, due to the decrease in revenue as described above. Operating Expenses  -  Operating expenses decreased $0.5 million during the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016. Selling, general and administrative decreased $1.2 million, primarily driven by a decrease in equity compensation of $0.7 million and payroll related decreases of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in investor relations expenses of $0.1 million. The decrease in SG&A expenses was partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in research and development due to our focus on refining our new products which are currently in government testing. Income Taxes  -  Income tax benefit remained unchanged during the six months ended December 31, 2017. The realization of tax benefits depends on the existence of future taxable income. Pursuant to FASB ASC 740, a valuation allowance has been established to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. 24 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of the change in our cash and cash equivalents: Six Months Ended   December 31, (In thousands)   2017   2016   change Change in cash and cash equivalents:                   Net cash used in operating activities   $ (5,849 )   $ (4,777 )   $ (1,072 ) Net cash provided by investing activities   4,301     6,593     (2,292 ) Net cash used in financing activities   (3 )   (1,283 )   1,280   Net change in cash and cash equivalents   $ (1,551 )   $ 533     $ (2,084 ) Cash and Cash Equivalents As of December 31, 2017, we held cash and cash equivalents of $0.6 million, and our working capital was approximately $6.9 million. As of June 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 million, and our working capital was approximately $11.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately $1.6 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to June 30, 2017, due to funding our normal operating activities and research and development initiatives, partially offset by the sale and maturities of some of our available-for-sale securities. Including our cash management investment portfolio, our cash and investments balance as of December 31, 2017 was $9.2 million. Operating Activities Cash used in operating activities increased $1.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016, primarily caused by a reduction in payroll related accruals and other accrued liabilities. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities decreased $2.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016, primarily caused by a decrease in the amount of available-for-sale securities matured. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities decreased $1.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016, due to a decrease in payments for shares repurchased. Liquidity As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.9 million, and our working capital was approximately $6.9 million. The Company reported a net loss of $11.6 million for the fiscal year 2017 and a net loss of $6.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, along with net cash used in operating activities of $8.8 million for the fiscal year 2017 and net cash used in operating activities of $5.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, but the Company remains resolute in identifying the optimal solution to the liquidity issue. Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products, payments under possible future strategic arrangements, continued progress of our research and development, the need to acquire licenses to new technology, costs associated with increasing our manufacturing and development capabilities, costs associated with strategic acquisitions including integration costs and assumed liabilities, and the status of competitive products and potential costs associated with both protecting and defending our intellectual property. Factors that could affect our capital requirements, in addition to those listed above, include continued collections of accounts receivable consistent with our historical experience and our ability to manage product development efforts. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to continue to fund our operating expenses, capital requirements, and other expected liquidity requirements through September 2018. 25 Table of Contents Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, the Company established a full valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company incurred pre-tax losses in the amount of $3.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively. For each of the six months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company incurred pre-tax losses in the amount of $6.1 million. The total effective tax rate was approximately 0% for each of the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016. For each of the six months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company's effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to recording of the valuation allowance placed against its net deferred tax assets. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. In the second quarter, the Company revised its estimated annual effective rate to reflect a change in its federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%. The rate change is effective on January 1, 2018; therefore, the Company's blended statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, is 27.52%. At December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed its accounting for all of the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, a reasonable estimate has been made. Note that the Company currently has net operating loss carryovers. A valuation allowance has been recorded to fully reserve for net operating loss carryovers, other carryovers, and book/tax differences on the balance sheet. FASB ASC 740, ""Income Taxes"" addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The Company had an unrecognized tax benefit of $0 for each of the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016. Loss carryovers are generally subject to modification by tax authorities until three years after they have been utilized; as such, the Company is subject to examination for the fiscal years ended 2000 through present for federal purposes and fiscal years ended 2006 through present for state purposes. The reason for this extended examination period is due to the utilization of the loss carryovers generated by the sale of our Astrotech Space Operations business unit in fiscal year 2015. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017.","ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.","ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS As of December 31, 2017, we are not involved in any pending or threatened legal proceedings that we believe could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and business disputes involving ordinary routine legal matters and claims incidental to our business. The ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to such matters generally cannot be estimated with certainty and requires the use of estimates in recording liabilities for potential litigation settlements or awards against us. Estimates for losses from litigation are made after consultation with outside counsel. If estimates of potential losses increase or the related facts and circumstances change in the future, we may be required to record either more or less litigation expense.","ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.  Based on that evaluation, and as a result of the material weakness described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are ineffective. Except as identified below, there have been no material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the 26 Table of Contents last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Management's Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017, based on the frame-work in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). As a result of our assessment, we identified control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. The following material weakness was present at December 31, 2017: • Our internal controls over the mathematical accuracy of disclosed amounts failed, resulting in an inadvertent error in the calculation of ""Net Loss per Common Share"" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered accounting firm pursuant to §989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which exempts the Company from the requirement that it include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over our management's assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. Remediation To remediate the material weakness described above, we are immediately implementing and/or plan to implement the following: • Design a remediation action for the review and analysis of earnings per share and improve the related policy and procedures; • Expand review of financial disclosures; and • Further document our tie out to our internal calculations. When fully implemented and operational, we believe the measures described above will remediate the material weakness we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. 27 Table of Contents","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001907/0001001907-18-000015-index.html"
